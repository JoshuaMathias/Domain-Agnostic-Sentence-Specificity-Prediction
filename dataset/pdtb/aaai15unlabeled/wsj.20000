wsj_0003	0	A form of asbestos once used to make Kent cigarette filters has caused a high percentage of cancer deaths among a group of workers exposed to it more than 30 years ago , researchers reported .
wsj_0003	1	The asbestos fiber , crocidolite , is unusually resilient once it enters the lungs , with even brief exposures to it causing symptoms that show up decades later , researchers said .
wsj_0003	2	Lorillard Inc. , the unit of New York-based Loews Corp. that makes Kent cigarettes , stopped using crocidolite in its Micronite cigarette filters in 1956 .
wsj_0003	3	Although preliminary findings were reported more than a year ago , the latest results appear in today 's New England Journal of Medicine , a forum likely to bring new attention to the problem .
wsj_0003	4	A Lorillard spokewoman said , `` This is an old story .
wsj_0003	5	We 're talking about years ago before anyone heard of asbestos having any questionable properties .
wsj_0003	6	There is no asbestos in our products now . ''
wsj_0003	7	Neither Lorillard nor the researchers who studied the workers were aware of any research on smokers of the Kent cigarettes .
wsj_0003	8	`` We have no useful information on whether users are at risk , '' said James A. Talcott of Boston 's Dana-Farber Cancer Institute .
wsj_0003	9	Dr. Talcott led a team of researchers from the National Cancer Institute and the medical schools of Harvard University and Boston University .
wsj_0003	10	The Lorillard spokeswoman said asbestos was used in `` very modest amounts '' in making paper for the filters in the early 1950s and replaced with a different type of filter in 1956 .
wsj_0003	11	From 1953 to 1955 , 9.8 billion Kent cigarettes with the filters were sold , the company said .
wsj_0003	12	Among 33 men who worked closely with the substance , 28 have died -- more than three times the expected number .
wsj_0003	13	Four of the five surviving workers have asbestos-related diseases , including three with recently diagnosed cancer .
wsj_0003	14	The total of 18 deaths from malignant mesothelioma , lung cancer and asbestosis was far higher than expected , the researchers said .
wsj_0003	15	`` The morbidity rate is a striking finding among those of us who study asbestos-related diseases , '' said Dr. Talcott .
wsj_0003	16	The percentage of lung cancer deaths among the workers at the West Groton , Mass. , paper factory appears to be the highest for any asbestos workers studied in Western industrialized countries , he said .
wsj_0003	17	The plant , which is owned by Hollingsworth & Vose Co. , was under contract with Lorillard to make the cigarette filters .
wsj_0003	18	The finding probably will support those who argue that the U.S. should regulate the class of asbestos including crocidolite more stringently than the common kind of asbestos , chrysotile , found in most schools and other buildings , Dr. Talcott said .
wsj_0003	19	The U.S. is one of the few industrialized nations that does n't have a higher standard of regulation for the smooth , needle-like fibers such as crocidolite that are classified as amphobiles , according to Brooke T. Mossman , a professor of pathlogy at the University of Vermont College of Medicine .
wsj_0003	20	More common chrysotile fibers are curly and are more easily rejected by the body , Dr. Mossman explained .
wsj_0003	21	In July , the Environmental Protection Agency imposed a gradual ban on virtually all uses of asbestos .
wsj_0003	22	By 1997 , almost all remaining uses of cancer-causing asbestos will be outlawed .
wsj_0003	23	About 160 workers at a factory that made paper for the Kent filters were exposed to asbestos in the 1950s .
wsj_0003	24	Areas of the factory were particularly dusty where the crocidolite was used .
wsj_0003	25	Workers dumped large burlap sacks of the imported material into a huge bin , poured in cotton and acetate fibers and mechanically mixed the dry fibers in a process used to make filters .
wsj_0003	26	Workers described `` clouds of blue dust '' that hung over parts of the factory , even though exhaust fans ventilated the area .
wsj_0003	27	`` There 's no question that some of those workers and managers contracted asbestos-related diseases , '' said Darrell Phillips , vice president of human resources for Hollingsworth & Vose .
wsj_0003	28	`` But you have to recognize that these events took place 35 years ago .
wsj_0003	29	It has no bearing on our work force today .

wsj_0010	0	When it 's time for their biannual powwow , the nation 's manufacturing titans typically jet off to the sunny confines of resort towns like Boca Raton and Hot Springs .
wsj_0010	1	The National Association of Manufacturers settled on the Hoosier capital of Indianapolis for its fall board meeting .
wsj_0010	2	And the city decided to treat its guests more like royalty or rock stars than factory owners .
wsj_0010	3	The idea , of course : to prove to 125 corporate decision makers that the buckle on the Rust Belt is n't so rusty after all , that it 's a good place for a company to expand .
wsj_0010	4	On the receiving end of the message were officials from giants like Du Pont and Maytag , along with lesser knowns like Trojan Steel and the Valley Queen Cheese Factory .
wsj_0010	5	For starters , the executives joined Mayor William H. Hudnut III for an evening of the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra and a guest pianist-comedian Victor Borge .
wsj_0010	6	Champagne and dessert followed .
wsj_0010	7	The next morning , with a police escort , busloads of executives and their wives raced to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway , unimpeded by traffic or red lights .
wsj_0010	8	The governor could n't make it , so the lieutenant governor welcomed the special guests .
wsj_0010	9	A buffet breakfast was held in the museum , where food and drinks are banned to everyday visitors .
wsj_0010	10	Then , in the guests ' honor , the speedway hauled out four drivers , crews and even the official Indianapolis 500 announcer for a 10-lap exhibition race .
wsj_0010	11	After the race , Fortune 500 executives drooled like schoolboys over the cars and drivers .
wsj_0010	12	No dummies , the drivers pointed out they still had space on their machines for another sponsor 's name or two .
wsj_0010	13	Back downtown , the execs squeezed in a few meetings at the hotel before boarding the buses again .
wsj_0010	14	This time , it was for dinner and dancing -- a block away .
wsj_0010	15	Under the stars and moons of the renovated Indiana Roof ballroom , nine of the hottest chefs in town fed them Indiana duckling mousseline , lobster consomme , veal mignon and chocolate terrine with a raspberry sauce .
wsj_0010	16	Knowing a tasty -- and free -- meal when they eat one , the executives gave the chefs a standing ovation .
wsj_0010	17	More than a few CEOs say the red-carpet treatment tempts them to return to a heartland city for future meetings .
wsj_0010	18	But for now , they 're looking forward to their winter meeting -- Boca in February .
wsj_0011	0	South Korea registered a trade deficit of $ 101 million in October , reflecting the country 's economic sluggishness , according to government figures released Wednesday .
wsj_0011	1	Preliminary tallies by the Trade and Industry Ministry showed another trade deficit in October , the fifth monthly setback this year , casting a cloud on South Korea 's export-oriented economy .
wsj_0011	2	Exports in October stood at $ 5.29 billion , a mere 0.7 % increase from a year earlier , while imports increased sharply to $ 5.39 billion , up 20 % from last October .
wsj_0011	3	South Korea 's economic boom , which began in 1986 , stopped this year because of prolonged labor disputes , trade conflicts and sluggish exports .
wsj_0011	4	Government officials said exports at the end of the year would remain under a government target of $ 68 billion .
wsj_0011	5	Despite the gloomy forecast , South Korea has recorded a trade surplus of $ 71 million so far this year .
wsj_0011	6	From January to October , the nation 's accumulated exports increased 4 % from the same period last year to $ 50.45 billion .
wsj_0011	7	Imports were at $ 50.38 billion , up 19 % .
wsj_0012	0	Newsweek , trying to keep pace with rival Time magazine , announced new advertising rates for 1990 and said it will introduce a new incentive plan for advertisers .
wsj_0012	1	The new ad plan from Newsweek , a unit of the Washington Post Co. , is the second incentive plan the magazine has offered advertisers in three years .
wsj_0012	2	Plans that give advertisers discounts for maintaining or increasing ad spending have become permanent fixtures at the news weeklies and underscore the fierce competition between Newsweek , Time Warner Inc. 's Time magazine , and Mortimer B. Zuckerman 's U.S. News & World Report .
wsj_0012	3	Alan Spoon , recently named Newsweek president , said Newsweek 's ad rates would increase 5 % in January .
wsj_0012	4	A full , four-color page in Newsweek will cost $ 100,980 .
wsj_0012	5	In mid-October , Time magazine lowered its guaranteed circulation rate base for 1990 while not increasing ad page rates ; with a lower circulation base , Time 's ad rate will be effectively 7.5 % higher per subscriber ; a full page in Time costs about $ 120,000 .
wsj_0012	6	U.S. News has yet to announce its 1990 ad rates .
wsj_0012	7	Newsweek said it will introduce the Circulation Credit Plan , which awards space credits to advertisers on `` renewal advertising . ''
wsj_0012	8	The magazine will reward with `` page bonuses '' advertisers who in 1990 meet or exceed their 1989 spending , as long as they spent $ 325,000 in 1989 and $ 340,000 in 1990 .
wsj_0012	9	Mr. Spoon said the plan is not an attempt to shore up a decline in ad pages in the first nine months of 1989 ; Newsweek 's ad pages totaled 1,620 , a drop of 3.2 % from last year , according to Publishers Information Bureau .
wsj_0012	10	`` What matters is what advertisers are paying per page , and in that department we are doing fine this fall , '' said Mr. Spoon .
wsj_0012	11	Both Newsweek and U.S. News have been gaining circulation in recent years without heavy use of electronic giveaways to subscribers , such as telephones or watches .
wsj_0012	12	However , none of the big three weeklies recorded circulation gains recently .
wsj_0012	13	According to Audit Bureau of Circulations , Time , the largest newsweekly , had average circulation of 4,393,237 , a decrease of 7.3 % .
wsj_0012	14	Newsweek 's circulation for the first six months of 1989 was 3,288,453 , flat from the same period last year .
wsj_0012	15	U.S. News ' circulation in the same time was 2,303,328 , down 2.6 % .
wsj_0013	0	New England Electric System bowed out of the bidding for Public Service Co. of New Hampshire , saying that the risks were too high and the potential payoff too far in the future to justify a higher offer .
wsj_0013	1	The move leaves United Illuminating Co. and Northeast Utilities as the remaining outside bidders for PS of New Hampshire , which also has proposed an internal reorganization plan in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings under which it would remain an independent company .
wsj_0013	2	New England Electric , based in Westborough , Mass. , had offered $ 2 billion to acquire PS of New Hampshire , well below the $ 2.29 billion value United Illuminating places on its bid and the $ 2.25 billion Northeast says its bid is worth .
wsj_0013	3	United Illuminating is based in New Haven , Conn. , and Northeast is based in Hartford , Conn .
wsj_0013	4	PS of New Hampshire , Manchester , N.H. , values its internal reorganization plan at about $ 2.2 billion .
wsj_0013	5	John Rowe , president and chief executive officer of New England Electric , said the company 's return on equity could suffer if it made a higher bid and its forecasts related to PS of New Hampshire -- such as growth in electricity demand and improved operating efficiencies -- did n't come true .
wsj_0013	6	`` When we evaluated raising our bid , the risks seemed substantial and persistent over the next five years , and the rewards seemed a long way out .
wsj_0013	7	That got hard to take , '' he added .
wsj_0013	8	Mr. Rowe also noted that political concerns also worried New England Electric .
wsj_0013	9	No matter who owns PS of New Hampshire , after it emerges from bankruptcy proceedings its rates will be among the highest in the nation , he said .
wsj_0013	10	`` That attracts attention ...
wsj_0013	11	it was just another one of the risk factors '' that led to the company 's decision to withdraw from the bidding , he added .
wsj_0013	12	Wilbur Ross Jr. of Rothschild Inc. , the financial adviser to the troubled company 's equity holders , said the withdrawal of New England Electric might speed up the reorganization process .
wsj_0013	13	The fact that New England proposed lower rate increases -- 4.8 % over seven years against around 5.5 % boosts proposed by the other two outside bidders -- complicated negotiations with state officials , Mr. Ross asserted .
wsj_0013	14	`` Now the field is less cluttered , '' he added .
wsj_0013	15	Separately , the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission turned down for now a request by Northeast seeking approval of its possible purchase of PS of New Hampshire .
wsj_0013	16	Northeast said it would refile its request and still hopes for an expedited review by the FERC so that it could complete the purchase by next summer if its bid is the one approved by the bankruptcy court .
wsj_0013	17	PS of New Hampshire shares closed yesterday at $ 3.75 , off 25 cents , in New York Stock Exchange composite trading .

wsj_0015	0	Commonwealth Edison Co. was ordered to refund about $ 250 million to its current and former ratepayers for illegal rates collected for cost overruns on a nuclear power plant .
wsj_0015	1	The refund was about $ 55 million more than previously ordered by the Illinois Commerce Commission and trade groups said it may be the largest ever required of a state or local utility .
wsj_0015	2	State court Judge Richard Curry ordered Edison to make average refunds of about $ 45 to $ 50 each to Edison customers who have received electric service since April 1986 , including about two million customers who have moved during that period .
wsj_0015	3	Judge Curry ordered the refunds to begin Feb. 1 and said that he would n't entertain any appeals or other attempts to block his order by Commonwealth Edison .
wsj_0015	4	`` The refund pool ... may not be held hostage through another round of appeals , '' Judge Curry said .
wsj_0015	5	Commonwealth Edison said it is already appealing the underlying commission order and is considering appealing Judge Curry 's order .
wsj_0015	6	The exact amount of the refund will be determined next year based on actual collections made until Dec. 31 of this year .
wsj_0015	7	Commonwealth Edison said the ruling could force it to slash its 1989 earnings by $ 1.55 a share .
wsj_0015	8	For 1988 , Commonwealth Edison reported earnings of $ 737.5 million , or $ 3.01 a share .
wsj_0015	9	A Commonwealth Edison spokesman said that tracking down the two million customers whose addresses have changed during the past 3 1/2 years would be `` an administrative nightmare . ''
wsj_0015	10	In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , Commonwealth Edison closed at $ 38.375 , down 12.5 cents .
wsj_0015	11	The $ 2.5 billion Byron 1 plant near Rockford , Ill. , was completed in 1985 .
wsj_0015	12	In a disputed 1985 ruling , the Commerce Commission said Commonwealth Edison could raise its electricity rates by $ 49 million to pay for the plant .
wsj_0015	13	But state courts upheld a challenge by consumer groups to the commission 's rate increase and found the rates illegal .
wsj_0015	14	The Illinois Supreme Court ordered the commission to audit Commonwealth Edison 's construction expenses and refund any unreasonable expenses .
wsj_0015	15	The utility has been collecting for the plant 's construction cost from its 3.1 million customers subject to a refund since 1986 .
wsj_0015	16	In August , the commission ruled that between $ 190 million and $ 195 million of the plant 's construction cost was unreasonable and should be refunded , plus interest .
wsj_0015	17	In his ruling , Judge Curry added an additional $ 55 million to the commission 's calculations .
wsj_0015	18	Last month , Judge Curry set the interest rate on the refund at 9 % .
wsj_0015	19	Commonwealth Edison now faces an additional court-ordered refund on its summer/winter rate differential collections that the Illinois Appellate Court has estimated at $ 140 million .
wsj_0015	20	And consumer groups hope that Judge Curry 's Byron 1 order may set a precedent for a second nuclear rate case involving Commonwealth Edison 's Braidwood 2 plant .
wsj_0015	21	Commonwealth Edison is seeking about $ 245 million in rate increases to pay for Braidwood 2 .
wsj_0015	22	The commission is expected to rule on the Braidwood 2 case by year end .
wsj_0015	23	Last year Commonwealth Edison had to refund $ 72.7 million for poor performance of its LaSalle I nuclear plant .
wsj_0016	0	Japan 's domestic sales of cars , trucks and buses in October rose 18 % from a year earlier to 500,004 units , a record for the month , the Japan Automobile Dealers ' Association said .

wsj_0016	2	The monthly sales have been setting records every month since March .
wsj_0016	3	October sales , compared with the previous month , inched down 0.4 % .
wsj_0016	4	Sales of passenger cars grew 22 % from a year earlier to 361,376 units .
wsj_0016	5	Sales of medium-sized cars , which benefited from price reductions arising from introduction of the consumption tax , more than doubled to 30,841 units from 13,056 in October 1988 .
wsj_0017	0	Texas Instruments Japan Ltd. , a unit of Texas Instruments Inc. , said it opened a plant in South Korea to manufacture control devices .
wsj_0017	1	The new plant , located in Chinchon about 60 miles from Seoul , will help meet increasing and diversifying demand for control products in South Korea , the company said .
wsj_0017	2	The plant will produce control devices used in motor vehicles and household appliances .
wsj_0018	0	The survival of spinoff Cray Computer Corp. as a fledgling in the supercomputer business appears to depend heavily on the creativity -- and longevity -- of its chairman and chief designer , Seymour Cray .
wsj_0018	1	Not only is development of the new company 's initial machine tied directly to Mr. Cray , so is its balance sheet .
wsj_0018	2	Documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on the pending spinoff disclosed that Cray Research Inc. will withdraw the almost $ 100 million in financing it is providing the new firm if Mr. Cray leaves or if the product-design project he heads is scrapped .
wsj_0018	3	The documents also said that although the 64-year-old Mr. Cray has been working on the project for more than six years , the Cray-3 machine is at least another year away from a fully operational prototype .
wsj_0018	4	Moreover , there have been no orders for the Cray-3 so far , though the company says it is talking with several prospects .
wsj_0018	5	While many of the risks were anticipated when Minneapolis-based Cray Research first announced the spinoff in May , the strings it attached to the financing had n't been made public until yesterday .
wsj_0018	6	`` We did n't have much of a choice , '' Cray Computer 's chief financial officer , Gregory Barnum , said in an interview .
wsj_0018	7	`` The theory is that Seymour is the chief designer of the Cray-3 , and without him it could not be completed .
wsj_0018	8	Cray Research did not want to fund a project that did not include Seymour . ''
wsj_0018	9	The documents also said that Cray Computer anticipates needing perhaps another $ 120 million in financing beginning next September .
wsj_0018	10	But Mr. Barnum called that `` a worst-case '' scenario .
wsj_0018	11	The filing on the details of the spinoff caused Cray Research stock to jump $ 2.875 yesterday to close at $ 38 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading .
wsj_0018	12	Analysts noted yesterday that Cray Research 's decision to link its $ 98.3 million promissory note to Mr. Cray 's presence will complicate a valuation of the new company .
wsj_0018	13	`` It has to be considered as an additional risk for the investor , '' said Gary P. Smaby of Smaby Group Inc. , Minneapolis .
wsj_0018	14	`` Cray Computer will be a concept stock , '' he said .
wsj_0018	15	`` You either believe Seymour can do it again or you do n't . ''
wsj_0018	16	Besides the designer 's age , other risk factors for Mr. Cray 's new company include the Cray-3 's tricky , unproven chip technology .
wsj_0018	17	The SEC documents describe those chips , which are made of gallium arsenide , as being so fragile and minute they will require special robotic handling equipment .
wsj_0018	18	In addition , the Cray-3 will contain 16 processors -- twice as many as the largest current supercomputer .
wsj_0018	19	Cray Computer also will face intense competition , not only from Cray Research , which has about 60 % of the world-wide supercomputer market and which is expected to roll out the C-90 machine , a direct competitor with the Cray-3 , in 1991 .
wsj_0018	20	The spinoff also will compete with International Business Machines Corp. and Japan 's Big Three -- Hitachi Ltd. , NEC Corp. and Fujitsu Ltd .
wsj_0018	21	The new company said it believes there are fewer than 100 potential customers for supercomputers priced between $ 15 million and $ 30 million -- presumably the Cray-3 price range .
wsj_0018	22	Under terms of the spinoff , Cray Research stockholders are to receive one Cray Computer share for every two Cray Research shares they own in a distribution expected to occur in about two weeks .
wsj_0018	23	No price for the new shares has been set .
wsj_0018	24	Instead , the companies will leave it up to the marketplace to decide .
wsj_0018	25	Cray Computer has applied to trade on Nasdaq .
wsj_0018	26	Analysts calculate Cray Computer 's initial book value at about $ 4.75 a share .
wsj_0018	27	Along with the note , Cray Research is transferring about $ 53 million in assets , primarily those related to the Cray-3 development , which has been a drain on Cray Research 's earnings .
wsj_0018	28	Pro-forma balance sheets clearly show why Cray Research favored the spinoff .
wsj_0018	29	Without the Cray-3 research and development expenses , the company would have been able to report a profit of $ 19.3 million for the first half of 1989 rather than the $ 5.9 million it posted .
wsj_0018	30	On the other hand , had it existed then , Cray Computer would have incurred a $ 20.5 million loss .
wsj_0018	31	Mr. Cray , who could n't be reached for comment , will work for the new Colorado Springs , Colo. , company as an independent contractor -- the arrangement he had with Cray Research .
wsj_0018	32	Regarded as the father of the supercomputer , Mr. Cray was paid $ 600,000 at Cray Research last year .
wsj_0018	33	At Cray Computer , he will be paid $ 240,000 .
wsj_0018	34	Besides Messrs. Cray and Barnum , other senior management at the company includes Neil Davenport , 47 , president and chief executive officer ; Joseph M. Blanchard , 37 , vice president , engineering ; Malcolm A. Hammerton , 40 , vice president , software ; and Douglas R. Wheeland , 45 , vice president , hardware .
wsj_0018	35	All came from Cray Research .
wsj_0018	36	Cray Computer , which currently employs 241 people , said it expects a work force of 450 by the end of 1990 .

wsj_0020	0	The U.S. , claiming some success in its trade diplomacy , removed South Korea , Taiwan and Saudi Arabia from a list of countries it is closely watching for allegedly failing to honor U.S. patents , copyrights and other intellectual-property rights .
wsj_0020	1	However , five other countries -- China , Thailand , India , Brazil and Mexico -- will remain on that so-called priority watch list as a result of an interim review , U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills announced .
wsj_0020	2	Under the new U.S. trade law , those countries could face accelerated unfair-trade investigations and stiff trade sanctions if they do n't improve their protection of intellectual property by next spring .
wsj_0020	3	Mrs. Hills said many of the 25 countries that she placed under varying degrees of scrutiny have made `` genuine progress '' on this touchy issue .
wsj_0020	4	She said there is `` growing realization '' around the world that denial of intellectual-property rights harms all trading nations , and particularly the `` creativity and inventiveness of an offending country 's own citizens . ''
wsj_0020	5	U.S. trade negotiators argue that countries with inadequate protections for intellectual-property rights could be hurting themselves by discouraging their own scientists and authors and by deterring U.S. high-technology firms from investing or marketing their best products there .
wsj_0020	6	Mrs. Hills lauded South Korea for creating an intellectual-property task force and special enforcement teams of police officers and prosecutors trained to pursue movie and book pirates .
wsj_0020	7	Seoul also has instituted effective search-and-seizure procedures to aid these teams , she said .
wsj_0020	8	Taiwan has improved its standing with the U.S. by initialing a bilateral copyright agreement , amending its trademark law and introducing legislation to protect foreign movie producers from unauthorized showings of their films .
wsj_0020	9	That measure could compel Taipei 's growing number of small video-viewing parlors to pay movie producers for showing their films .
wsj_0020	10	Saudi Arabia , for its part , has vowed to enact a copyright law compatible with international standards and to apply the law to computer software as well as to literary works , Mrs. Hills said .
wsj_0020	11	These three countries are n't completely off the hook , though .
wsj_0020	12	They will remain on a lower-priority list that includes 17 other countries .
wsj_0020	13	Those countries -- including Japan , Italy , Canada , Greece and Spain -- are still of some concern to the U.S. but are deemed to pose less-serious problems for American patent and copyright owners than those on the `` priority '' list .
wsj_0020	14	Gary Hoffman , a Washington lawyer specializing in intellectual-property cases , said the threat of U.S. retaliation , combined with a growing recognition that protecting intellectual property is in a country 's own interest , prompted the improvements made by South Korea , Taiwan and Saudi Arabia .
wsj_0020	15	`` What this tells us is that U.S. trade law is working , '' he said .
wsj_0020	16	He said Mexico could be one of the next countries to be removed from the priority list because of its efforts to craft a new patent law .
wsj_0020	17	Mrs. Hills said that the U.S. is still concerned about `` disturbing developments in Turkey and continuing slow progress in Malaysia . ''
wsj_0020	18	She did n't elaborate , although earlier U.S. trade reports have complained of videocassette piracy in Malaysia and disregard for U.S. pharmaceutical patents in Turkey .
wsj_0020	19	The 1988 trade act requires Mrs. Hills to issue another review of the performance of these countries by April 30 .
wsj_0020	20	So far , Mrs. Hills has n't deemed any cases bad enough to merit an accelerated investigation under the so-called special 301 provision of the act .
wsj_0021	0	Argentina said it will ask creditor banks to halve its foreign debt of $ 64 billion -- the third-highest in the developing world .
wsj_0021	1	The declaration by Economy Minister Nestor Rapanelli is believed to be the first time such an action has been called for by an Argentine official of such stature .
wsj_0021	2	The Latin American nation has paid very little on its debt since early last year .
wsj_0021	3	`` Argentina aspires to reach a reduction of 50 % in the value of its external debt , '' Mr. Rapanelli said through his spokesman , Miguel Alurralde .
wsj_0021	4	Mr. Rapanelli met in August with U.S. Assistant Treasury Secretary David Mulford .
wsj_0021	5	Argentine negotiator Carlos Carballo was in Washington and New York this week to meet with banks .
wsj_0021	6	Mr. Rapanelli recently has said the government of President Carlos Menem , who took office July 8 , feels a significant reduction of principal and interest is the only way the debt problem may be solved .
wsj_0021	7	But he has not said before that the country wants half the debt forgiven .
wsj_0023	0	F.H. Faulding & Co. , an Australian pharmaceuticals company , said its Moleculon Inc. affiliate acquired Kalipharma Inc. for $ 23 million .
wsj_0023	1	Kalipharma is a New Jersey-based pharmaceuticals concern that sells products under the Purepac label .
wsj_0023	2	Faulding said it owns 33 % of Moleculon 's voting stock and has an agreement to acquire an additional 19 % .
wsj_0023	3	That stake , together with its convertible preferred stock holdings , gives Faulding the right to increase its interest to 70 % of Moleculon 's voting stock .
wsj_0024	0	Oil production from Australia 's Bass Strait fields will be raised by 11,000 barrels a day to about 321,000 barrels with the launch of the Whiting field , the first of five small fields scheduled to be brought into production before the end of 1990 .
wsj_0024	1	Esso Australia Ltd. , a unit of New York-based Exxon Corp. , and Broken Hill Pty. operate the fields in a joint venture .
wsj_0024	2	Esso said the Whiting field started production Tuesday .
wsj_0024	3	Output will be gradually increased until it reaches about 11,000 barrels a day .
wsj_0024	4	The field has reserves of 21 million barrels .
wsj_0024	5	Reserves for the five new fields total 50 million barrels .
wsj_0024	6	The Perch and Dolphin fields are expected to start producing early next year , and the Seahorse and Tarwhine fields later next year .
wsj_0024	7	Esso said the fields were developed after the Australian government decided in 1987 to make the first 30 million barrels from new fields free of excise tax .
wsj_0025	0	R.P. Scherer Corp. said it completed the $ 10.2 million sale of its Southern Optical subsidiary to a group led by the unit 's president , Thomas R. Sloan , and other managers .
wsj_0025	1	Following the acquisition of R.P. Scherer by a buy-out group led by Shearson Lehman Hutton earlier this year , the maker of gelatin capsules decided to divest itself of certain of its non-encapsulating businesses .
wsj_0025	2	The sale of Southern Optical is a part of the program .
wsj_0026	0	The White House said President Bush has approved duty-free treatment for imports of certain types of watches that are n't produced in `` significant quantities '' in the U.S. , the Virgin Islands and other U.S. possessions .
wsj_0026	1	The action came in response to a petition filed by Timex Inc. for changes in the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences for imports from developing nations .
wsj_0026	2	Previously , watch imports were denied such duty-free treatment .
wsj_0026	3	Timex had requested duty-free treatment for many types of watches , covered by 58 different U.S. tariff classifications .
wsj_0026	4	The White House said Mr. Bush decided to grant duty-free status for 18 categories , but turned down such treatment for other types of watches `` because of the potential for material injury to watch producers located in the U.S. and the Virgin Islands . ''
wsj_0026	5	Timex is a major U.S. producer and seller of watches , including low-priced battery-operated watches assembled in the Philippines and other developing nations covered by the U.S. tariff preferences .
wsj_0026	6	U.S. trade officials said the Philippines and Thailand would be the main beneficiaries of the president 's action .
wsj_0026	7	Imports of the types of watches that now will be eligible for duty-free treatment totaled about $ 37.3 million in 1988 , a relatively small share of the $ 1.5 billion in U.S. watch imports that year , according to an aide to U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills .
wsj_0027	0	Magna International Inc. 's chief financial officer , James McAlpine , resigned and its chairman , Frank Stronach , is stepping in to help turn the automotive-parts manufacturer around , the company said .
wsj_0027	1	Mr. Stronach will direct an effort to reduce overhead and curb capital spending `` until a more satisfactory level of profit is achieved and maintained , '' Magna said .
wsj_0027	2	Stephen Akerfeldt , currently vice president finance , will succeed Mr. McAlpine .
wsj_0027	3	An ambitious expansion has left Magna with excess capacity and a heavy debt load as the automotive industry enters a downturn .
wsj_0027	4	The company has reported declines in operating profit in each of the past three years , despite steady sales growth .
wsj_0027	5	Magna recently cut its quarterly dividend in half and the company 's Class A shares are wallowing far below their 52-week high of 16.125 Canadian dollars US$ 13.73 .
wsj_0027	6	On the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday , Magna shares closed up 37.5 Canadian cents to C$ 9.625 .
wsj_0027	7	Mr. Stronach , founder and controlling shareholder of Magna , resigned as chief executive officer last year to seek , unsuccessfully , a seat in Canada 's Parliament .
wsj_0027	8	Analysts said Mr. Stronach wants to resume a more influential role in running the company .
wsj_0027	9	They expect him to cut costs throughout the organization .
wsj_0027	10	The company said Mr. Stronach will personally direct the restructuring , assisted by Manfred Gingl , president and chief executive .
wsj_0027	11	Neither they nor Mr. McAlpine could be reached for comment .
wsj_0027	12	Magna said Mr. McAlpine resigned to pursue a consulting career , with Magna as one of his clients .

wsj_0029	0	Japanese investors nearly single-handedly bought up two new mortgage securities-based mutual funds totaling $ 701 million , the U.S. Federal National Mortgage Association said .
wsj_0029	1	The purchases show the strong interest of Japanese investors in U.S. mortgage-based instruments , Fannie Mae 's chairman , David O. Maxwell , said at a news conference .
wsj_0029	2	He said more than 90 % of the funds were placed with Japanese institutional investors .
wsj_0029	3	The rest went to investors from France and Hong Kong .
wsj_0029	4	Earlier this year , Japanese investors snapped up a similar , $ 570 million mortgage-backed securities mutual fund .
wsj_0029	5	That fund was put together by Blackstone Group , a New York investment bank .
wsj_0029	6	The latest two funds were assembled jointly by Goldman , Sachs & Co. of the U.S. and Japan 's Daiwa Securities Co .
wsj_0029	7	The new , seven-year funds -- one offering a fixed-rate return and the other with a floating-rate return linked to the London interbank offered rate -- offer two key advantages to Japanese investors .
wsj_0029	8	First , they are designed to eliminate the risk of prepayment -- mortgage-backed securities can be retired early if interest rates decline , and such prepayment forces investors to redeploy their money at lower rates .
wsj_0029	9	Second , they channel monthly mortgage payments into semiannual payments , reducing the administrative burden on investors .
wsj_0029	10	By addressing those problems , Mr. Maxwell said , the new funds have become `` extremely attractive to Japanese and other investors outside the U.S. . ''
wsj_0029	11	Such devices have boosted Japanese investment in mortgage-backed securities to more than 1 % of the $ 900 billion in such instruments outstanding , and their purchases are growing at a rapid rate .
wsj_0029	12	They also have become large purchasers of Fannie Mae 's corporate debt , buying $ 2.4 billion in Fannie Mae bonds during the first nine months of the year , or almost a tenth of the total amount issued .
wsj_0030	0	James L. Pate , 54-year-old executive vice president , was named a director of this oil concern , expanding the board to 14 members .
wsj_0031	0	LTV Corp. said a federal bankruptcy court judge agreed to extend until March 8 , 1990 , the period in which the steel , aerospace and energy products company has the exclusive right to file a reorganization plan .

wsj_0032	0	Italian chemical giant Montedison S.p.A. , through its Montedison Acquisition N.V. indirect unit , began its $ 37-a-share tender offer for all the common shares outstanding of Erbamont N.V. , a maker of pharmaceuticals incorporated in the Netherlands .
wsj_0032	1	The offer , advertised in today 's editions of The Wall Street Journal , is scheduled to expire at the end of November .
wsj_0032	2	Montedison currently owns about 72 % of Erbamont 's common shares outstanding .
wsj_0032	3	The offer is being launched pursuant to a previously announced agreement between the companies .
wsj_0033	0	Japan 's reserves of gold , convertible foreign currencies , and special drawing rights fell by a hefty $ 1.82 billion in October to $ 84.29 billion , the Finance Ministry said .
wsj_0033	1	The total marks the sixth consecutive monthly decline .
wsj_0033	2	The protracted downturn reflects the intensity of Bank of Japan yen-support intervention since June , when the U.S. currency temporarily surged above the 150.00 yen level .
wsj_0033	3	The announcement follows a sharper $ 2.2 billion decline in the country 's foreign reserves in September to $ 86.12 billion .
wsj_0035	0	The U.S. and Soviet Union are holding technical talks about possible repayment by Moscow of $ 188 million in pre-Communist Russian debts owed to the U.S. government , the State Department said .
wsj_0035	1	If the debts are repaid , it could clear the way for Soviet bonds to be sold in the U.S. .
wsj_0035	2	However , after two meetings with the Soviets , a State Department spokesman said that it 's `` too early to say '' whether that will happen .
wsj_0035	3	Coincident with the talks , the State Department said it has permitted a Soviet bank to open a New York branch .
wsj_0035	4	The branch of the Bank for Foreign Economic Affairs was approved last spring and opened in July .
wsj_0035	5	But a Soviet bank here would be crippled unless Moscow found a way to settle the $ 188 million debt , which was lent to the country 's short-lived democratic Kerensky government before the Communists seized power in 1917 .
wsj_0035	6	Under a 1934 law , the Johnson Debt Default Act , as amended , it 's illegal for Americans to extend credit to countries in default to the U.S. government , unless they are members of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund .
wsj_0035	7	The U.S.S.R. belongs to neither organization .
wsj_0035	8	Moscow has settled pre-1917 debts with other countries in recent years at less than face value .
wsj_0035	9	The State Department stressed the pre-1933 debts as the key to satisfying the Johnson Act .
wsj_0035	10	But the Soviets might still face legal obstacles to raising money in the U.S. until they settle hundreds of millions of dollars in additional debt still outstanding from the World War II lend-lease program .
wsj_0038	0	BRAMALEA Ltd. said it agreed to issue 100 million Canadian dollars US$ 85.1 million of 10.5 % senior debentures due Nov. 30 , 1999 , together with 100,000 bond purchase warrants .
wsj_0038	1	The Toronto-based real estate concern said each bond warrant entitles the holder to buy C$ 1,000 principal amount of debentures at par plus accrued interest to the date of purchase .
wsj_0038	2	The warrants expire Nov. 30 , 1990 .
wsj_0038	3	The issue will be swapped into fixed-rate U.S. dollars at a rate the company said is less than 9 % ; a spokesman declined to elaborate .
wsj_0038	4	Lead underwriters for the issue are Scotia McLeod Inc. and RBC Dominion Securities Inc. , both Toronto-based investment dealers .
wsj_0038	5	Bramalea said it expects to complete the issue by the end of the month .
wsj_0040	0	Boeing Co. said it is discussing plans with three of its regular Japanese suppliers to possibly help build a larger version of its popular 767 twin-jet .
wsj_0040	1	The discussions are still in preliminary stages , and the specific details have n't been worked out between the Seattle aerospace company and Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd. , Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. and Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd .
wsj_0040	2	The three Japanese companies build the body sections of the 767 , accounting for a combined 15 % of the aircraft .
wsj_0040	3	Japanese press reports have speculated that the Japanese contribution could rise to between 20 % and 25 % under the new program .
wsj_0040	4	If Boeing goes ahead with the larger 767 , the plane could hit the market in the mid-1990s .
wsj_0041	0	This is the year the negative ad , for years a secondary presence in most political campaigns , became the main event .
wsj_0041	1	The irony is that the attack commercial , after getting a boost in last year 's presidential campaign , has come of age in an off-off election year with only a few contests scattered across the country .
wsj_0041	2	But in the three leading political contests of 1989 , the negative ads have reached new levels of hostility , raising fears that this kind of mudslinging , empty of significant issues , is ushering in a new era of campaigns without content .
wsj_0041	3	`` Now , '' says Joseph Napolitan , a pioneer in political television , `` the idea is to attack first , last and always . ''
wsj_0041	4	A trend that started with the first stirrings of politics , accelerated with the dawn of the television age and became a sometimes-tawdry art form in 1988 , has reached an entirely new stage .
wsj_0041	5	`` To get people 's attention these days , '' says Douglas Bailey , a political consultant , `` your TV ad needs to be bold and entertaining , and , more often than not , that means confrontational .
wsj_0041	6	And , unlike a few years ago , you do n't even have to worry whether the ad is truthful . ''
wsj_0041	7	In 1989 , as often as not , the principal fights in the major campaigns are prompted by the ads themselves .
wsj_0041	8	Take a look , then , at the main attack commercials that set the tone for Tuesday 's elections in New York City , New Jersey and Virginia :
wsj_0041	9	The screen fills with a small , tight facial shot of David Dinkins , Democratic candidate for mayor of New York City .
wsj_0041	10	`` David Dinkins failed to file his income taxes for four straight years , '' says a disembodied male voice .
wsj_0041	11	And then this television commercial , paid for by Republican Rudolph Giuliani 's campaign and produced by Roger Ailes , the master of negative TV ads , really gets down to business .
wsj_0041	12	Mr. Dinkins , the ad charges , also failed to report his campaign contributions accurately , hid his links to a failing insurance company and paid a convicted kidnapper `` through a phony organization with no members , no receipts and no office . ''
wsj_0041	13	`` David Dinkins , '' says the kicker , `` Why does he always wait until he 's caught ? ''
wsj_0041	14	`` Nasty innuendoes , '' says John Siegal , Mr. Dinkins 's issues director , `` designed to prosecute a case of political corruption that simply does n't exist . ''
wsj_0041	15	Stung by the Giuliani ads , Mr. Dinkins 's TV consultants , Robert Shrum and David Doak , finally unleashed a negative ad of their own .
wsj_0041	16	The screen shows two distorted , unrecognizable photos , presumably of two politicians .
wsj_0041	17	`` Compare two candidates for mayor , '' says the announcer .
wsj_0041	18	`` One says he 's for banning cop-killer bullets .
wsj_0041	19	The other has opposed a ban on cop-killer bullets .
wsj_0041	20	One claims he 's pro-choice .
wsj_0041	21	The other has opposed a woman 's right to choose . ''
wsj_0041	22	`` Funny thing , '' says the kicker , `` both these candidates are named Rudolph Giuliani . ''
wsj_0041	23	Who 's telling the truth ?
wsj_0041	24	Everybody -- and nobody .
wsj_0041	25	It 's a classic situation of ads that are true but not always fully accurate .
wsj_0041	26	Mr. Dinkins did fail to file his income taxes for four years , but he insists he voluntarily admitted the `` oversight '' when he was being considered for a city job .
wsj_0041	27	He was on the board of an insurance company with financial problems , but he insists he made no secret of it .
wsj_0041	28	The city 's Campaign Finance Board has refused to pay Mr. Dinkins $ 95,142 in matching funds because his campaign records are incomplete .
wsj_0041	29	The campaign has blamed these reporting problems on computer errors .
wsj_0041	30	And , says Mr. Dinkins , he did n't know the man his campaign paid for a get-out-the-vote effort had been convicted of kidnapping .
wsj_0041	31	But , say Mr. Dinkins 's managers , he did have an office and his organization did have members .
wsj_0041	32	Mr. Giuliani 's campaign chairman , Peter Powers , says the Dinkins ad is `` deceptive . ''
wsj_0041	33	The other side , he argues , `` knows Giuliani has always been pro-choice , even though he has personal reservations .
wsj_0041	34	They know he is generally opposed to cop-killer bullets , but that he had some reservations about the language in the legislation . ''
wsj_0041	35	Democratic Lt. Gov. Douglas Wilder opened his gubernatorial battle with Republican Marshall Coleman with an abortion commercial produced by Frank Greer that analysts of every political persuasion agree was a tour de force .
wsj_0041	36	Against a shot of Monticello superimposed on an American flag , an announcer talks about the `` strong tradition of freedom and individual liberty '' that Virginians have nurtured for generations .
wsj_0041	37	Then , just as an image of the statue of Thomas Jefferson dissolves from the screen , the announcer continues : `` On the issue of abortion , Marshall Coleman wants to take away your right to choose and give it to the politicians . ''
wsj_0041	38	That commercial -- which said Mr. Coleman wanted to take away the right of abortion `` even in cases of rape and incest , '' a charge Mr. Coleman denies -- changed the dynamics of the campaign , transforming it , at least in part , into a referendum on abortion .
wsj_0041	39	The ad prompted Mr. Coleman , the former Virginia attorney general , to launch a series of advertisements created by Bob Goodman and designed to shake Mr. Wilder 's support among the very women who were attracted by the abortion ad .
wsj_0041	40	The Coleman counterattack featured a close-up of a young woman in shadows and the ad suggested that she was recalling an unpleasant courtroom ordeal .
wsj_0041	41	A voice says , `` C'mon , now , do n't you have boyfriends ? ''
wsj_0041	42	Then an announcer interjects : `` It was Douglas Wilder who introduced a bill to force rape victims age 13 and younger to be interrogated about their private lives by lawyers for accused rapists .
wsj_0041	43	So the next time Mr. Wilder talks about the rights of women , ask him about this law he tried to pass . ''
wsj_0041	44	Mr. Wilder did introduce such legislation 17 years ago , but he did so at the request of a constituent , a common legislative technique used by lawmakers .
wsj_0041	45	The legislation itself noted that it was introduced `` by request , '' and in 1983 Mr. Wilder introduced a bill to protect rape victims from unfounded interrogation .
wsj_0041	46	`` People have grown tired of these ads and Coleman has gotten the stigma of being a negative campaigner , '' says Mark Rozell , a political scientist at Mary Washington College .
wsj_0041	47	`` Wilder has managed to get across the idea that Coleman will say anything to get elected governor and -- more important -- has been able to put the onus for all the negative campaigning on Coleman . ''
wsj_0041	48	Mr. Coleman said this week that he would devote the remainder of the political season to positive campaigning , but the truce lasted only hours .
wsj_0041	49	By Tuesday night , television stations were carrying new ads featuring Mr. Coleman himself raising questions about Mr. Wilder 's sensitivity to rape victims .
wsj_0041	50	The attacks began when Democratic Rep. James Florio aired an ad featuring a drawing of Pinocchio and a photograph of Mr. Florio 's rival , Republican Rep. Jim Courter .
wsj_0041	51	`` Remember Pinocchio ? '' says a female voice .
wsj_0041	52	`` Consider Jim Courter . ''
wsj_0041	53	And then this commercial , produced by Bob Squier , gets down to its own mean and dirty business .
wsj_0041	54	Pictures of rusted oil drums swim into focus , and the female voice purrs , `` That hazardous waste on his Mr. Courter 's property -- the neighbors are suing for consumer fraud . ''
wsj_0041	55	And the nose on Mr. Courter 's face grows .
wsj_0041	56	The only fraud involved , cry Mr. Courter 's partisans , is the Florio commercial itself , and so the Courter campaign has responded with its own Pinocchio commercial , produced by Mr. Ailes .
wsj_0041	57	In this one , the screen fills with photographs of both candidates .
wsj_0041	58	`` Who 's really lying ? '' asks a female voice .
wsj_0041	59	`` Florio 's lying , '' the voice goes on , because `` the barrel on Courter 's land ... contained heating oil , was cleaned up and caused no pollution . ''
wsj_0041	60	Mr. Courter 's long nose shrinks while Mr. Florio 's grows .
wsj_0041	61	Who 's telling the truth ?
wsj_0041	62	Stephen Salmore , a political scientist at New Jersey 's Eagleton Institute , says it 's another example of an ad that 's true but not fully accurate .
wsj_0041	63	Barrels were dumped on the Courter property , a complaint was made , but there is no evidence the barrels were a serious threat to the environment .
wsj_0041	64	Even so , according to Mr. Salmore , the ad was `` devastating '' because it raised questions about Mr. Courter 's credibility .
wsj_0041	65	But it 's building on a long tradition .
wsj_0041	66	In 1966 , on route to a re-election rout of Democrat Frank O'Connor , GOP Gov. Nelson Rockefeller of New York appeared in person saying , `` If you want to keep the crime rates high , O'Connor is your man . ''

wsj_0043	0	Japanese investment in Southeast Asia is propelling the region toward economic integration .
wsj_0043	1	Interviews with analysts and business people in the U.S. suggest that Japanese capital may produce the economic cooperation that Southeast Asian politicians have pursued in fits and starts for decades .
wsj_0043	2	But Japan 's power in the region also is sparking fears of domination and posing fresh policy questions .
wsj_0043	3	The flow of Japanese funds has set in motion `` a process whereby these economies will be knitted together by the great Japanese investment machine , '' says Robert Hormats , vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International Corp .
wsj_0043	4	In the past five years , Japanese companies have tripled their commitments in Asia to $ 5.57 billion .
wsj_0043	5	In Thailand , for example , the government 's Board of Investment approved $ 705.6 million of Japanese investment in 1988 , 10 times the U.S. investment figure for the year .
wsj_0043	6	Japan 's commitment in Southeast Asia also includes steep increases in foreign assistance and trade .
wsj_0043	7	Asia 's other cash-rich countries are following Japan 's lead and pumping capital into the region .
wsj_0043	8	In Taiwan and South Korea , rising wages are forcing manufacturers to seek other overseas sites for labor-intensive production .
wsj_0043	9	These nations , known as Asia 's `` little tigers , '' also are contributing to Southeast Asia 's integration , but their influence will remain subordinate to Japan 's .
wsj_0043	10	For recipient countries such as Thailand and Malaysia , the investment will provide needed jobs and spur growth .
wsj_0043	11	But Asian nations ' harsh memories of their military domination by Japan in the early part of this century make them fearful of falling under Japanese economic hegemony now .
wsj_0043	12	Because of budget constraints in Washington , the U.S. encourages Japan to share economic burdens in the region .
wsj_0043	13	But it resists yielding political ground .
wsj_0043	14	In the coming decade , analysts say , U.S.-Japanese relations will be tested as Tokyo comes to terms with its new status as the region 's economic behemoth .
wsj_0043	15	Japan 's swelling investment in Southeast Asia is part of its economic evolution .
wsj_0043	16	In the past decade , Japanese manufacturers concentrated on domestic production for export .
wsj_0043	17	In the 1990s , spurred by rising labor costs and the strong yen , these companies will increasingly turn themselves into multinationals with plants around the world .
wsj_0043	18	To capture the investment , Southeast Asian nations will move to accommodate Japanese business .
wsj_0043	19	These nations ' internal decisions `` will be made in a way not to offend their largest aid donor , largest private investor and largest lender , '' says Richard Drobnick , director of the international business and research program at the University of Southern California 's Graduate School of Business .
wsj_0043	20	Japanese money will help turn Southeast Asia into a more cohesive economic region .
wsj_0043	21	But , analysts say , Asian cooperation is n't likely to parallel the European Common Market approach .
wsj_0043	22	Rather , Japanese investment will spur integration of certain sectors , says Kent Calder , a specialist in East Asian economies at the Woodrow Wilson School for Public and Internatonal Affairs at Princeton University .
wsj_0043	23	In electronics , for example , a Japanese company might make television picture tubes in Japan , assemble the sets in Malaysia and export them to Indonesia .
wsj_0043	24	`` The effect will be to pull Asia together not as a common market but as an integrated production zone , '' says Goldman Sachs 's Mr. Hormats .
wsj_0043	25	Countries in the region also are beginning to consider a framework for closer economic and political ties .
wsj_0043	26	The economic and foreign ministers of 12 Asian and Pacific nations will meet in Australia next week to discuss global trade issues as well as regional matters such as transportation and telecommunications .
wsj_0043	27	Participants will include the U.S. , Australia , Canada , Japan , South Korea and New Zealand as well as the six members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations -- Thailand , Malaysia , Singapore , Indonesia , the Philippines and Brunei .
wsj_0043	28	In addition , the U.S. this year offered its own plan for cooperation around the Pacific rim in a major speech by Secretary of State James Baker , following up a proposal made in January by Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke .
wsj_0043	29	The Baker proposal reasserts Washington 's intention to continue playing a leading political role in the region .
wsj_0043	30	`` In Asia , as in Europe , a new order is taking shape , '' Mr. Baker said .
wsj_0043	31	`` The U.S. , with its regional friends , must play a crucial role in designing its architecture . ''
wsj_0043	32	But maintaining U.S. influence will be difficult in the face of Japanese dominance in the region .
wsj_0043	33	Japan not only outstrips the U.S. in investment flows but also outranks it in trade with most Southeast Asian countries although the U.S. remains the leading trade partner for all of Asia .
wsj_0043	34	Moreover , the Japanese government , now the world 's largest aid donor , is pumping far more assistance into the region than the U.S. is .
wsj_0043	35	While U.S. officials voice optimism about Japan 's enlarged role in Asia , they also convey an undertone of caution .
wsj_0043	36	`` There 's an understanding on the part of the U.S. that Japan has to expand its functions '' in Asia , says J. Michael Farren , undersecretary of commerce for trade .
wsj_0043	37	`` If they approach it with a benevolent , altruistic attitude , there will be a net gain for everyone . ''
wsj_0043	38	Some Asian nations are apprehensive about Washington 's demand that Tokyo step up its military spending to ease the U.S. security burden in the region .
wsj_0043	39	The issue is further complicated by uncertainty over the future of the U.S. 's leases on military bases in the Philippines and by a possible U.S. troop reduction in South Korea .
wsj_0043	40	Many Asians regard a U.S. presence as a desirable counterweight to Japanese influence .
wsj_0043	41	`` No one wants the U.S. to pick up its marbles and go home , '' Mr. Hormats says .
wsj_0043	42	For their part , Taiwan and South Korea are expected to step up their own investments in the next decade to try to slow the Japanese juggernaut .
wsj_0043	43	`` They do n't want Japan to monopolize the region and sew it up , '' says Chong-sik Lee , professor of East Asian politics at the University of Pennsylvania .
wsj_0046	0	Alleghany Corp. said it completed the acquisition of Sacramento Savings & Loan Association from the H.N. & Frances C. Berger Foundation for $ 150 million .
wsj_0046	1	The Sacramento-based S&L , which has 44 branch offices in north central California , had assets of $ 2.4 billion at the end of September .
wsj_0046	2	New York-based Alleghany is an insurance and financial services concern .
wsj_0046	3	The purchase price includes two ancillary companies .
wsj_0047	0	The Department of Health and Human Services plans to extend its moratorium on federal funding of research involving fetal-tissue transplants .
wsj_0047	1	Medical researchers believe the transplantation of small amounts of fetal tissue into humans could help treat juvenile diabetes and such degenerative diseases as Alzheimer 's , Parkinson 's and Huntington 's .
wsj_0047	2	But anti-abortionists oppose such research because they worry that the development of therapies using fetal-tissue transplants could lead to an increase in abortions .
wsj_0047	3	James Mason , assistant secretary for health , said the ban on federal funding of fetal-tissue transplant research `` should be continued indefinitely . ''
wsj_0047	4	He said the ban wo n't stop privately funded tissue-transplant research or federally funded fetal-tissue research that does n't involve transplants .
wsj_0047	5	Department officials say that HHS Secretary Louis Sullivan will support Dr. Mason 's ruling , which will be issued soon in the form of a letter to the acting director of the National Institutes of Health .
wsj_0047	6	Both Dr. Mason and Dr. Sullivan oppose federal funding for abortion , as does President Bush , except in cases where a woman 's life is threatened .
wsj_0047	7	The controversy began in 1987 when the National Institutes of Health , aware of the policy implications of its research , asked for an HHS review of its plan to implant fetal tissue into the brain of a patient suffering from Parkinson 's disease .
wsj_0047	8	The department placed a moratorium on the research , pending a review of scientific , legal and ethical issues .
wsj_0047	9	A majority of an NIH-appointed panel recommended late last year that the research continue under carefully controlled conditions , but the issue became embroiled in politics as anti-abortion groups continued to oppose federal funding .
wsj_0047	10	The dispute has hampered the administration 's efforts to recruit prominent doctors to fill prestigious posts at the helm of the NIH and the Centers for Disease Control .
wsj_0047	11	Several candidates have withdrawn their names from consideration after administration officials asked them for their views on abortion and fetal-tissue transplants .
wsj_0047	12	Antonio Novello , whom Mr. Bush nominated to serve as surgeon general , reportedly has assured the administration that she opposes abortion .
wsj_0047	13	Dr. Novello is deputy director of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development .
wsj_0047	14	Some researchers have charged that the administration is imposing new ideological tests for top scientific posts .
wsj_0047	15	Earlier this week , Dr. Sullivan tried to defuse these charges by stressing that candidates to head the NIH and the CDC will be judged by `` standards of scientific and administrative excellence , '' not politics .
wsj_0047	16	But the administration 's handling of the fetal-tissue transplant issue disturbs many scientists .
wsj_0047	17	`` When scientific progress moves into uncharted ground , there has to be a role for society to make judgments about its applications , '' says Myron Genel , associate dean of the Yale Medical School .
wsj_0047	18	`` The disturbing thing about this abortion issue is that the debate has become polarized , so that no mechanism exists '' for finding a middle ground .
wsj_0047	19	Yale is one of the few medical institutions conducting privately funded research on fetal-tissue transplants .
wsj_0047	20	But Dr. Genel warns that Dr. Mason 's ruling may discourage private funding .
wsj_0047	21	`` The unavailability of federal funds , and the climate in which the decision was made , certainly do n't provide any incentive for one of the more visible foundations to provide support , '' he said .
wsj_0047	22	Despite the flap over transplants , federal funding of research involving fetal tissues will continue on a number of fronts .
wsj_0047	23	`` Such research may ultimately result in the ability to regenerate damaged tissues or to turn off genes that cause cancer '' or to regulate genes that cause Down 's syndrome , the leading cause of mental retardation , according to an NIH summary .
wsj_0047	24	The NIH currently spends about $ 8 million annually on fetal-tissue research out of a total research budget of $ 8 billion .
wsj_0048	0	Rekindled hope that two New England states will allow broader interstate banking boosted Nasdaq 's bank stocks , but the over-the-counter market was up only slightly in lackluster trading .
wsj_0048	1	The Nasdaq composite index added 1.01 to 456.64 on paltry volume of 118.6 million shares .
wsj_0048	2	In terms of volume , it was an inauspicious beginning for November .
wsj_0048	3	Yesterday 's share turnover was well below the year 's daily average of 133.8 million .
wsj_0048	4	In October , the busiest month of the year so far , daily volume averaged roughly 145 million shares .
wsj_0048	5	The Nasdaq 100 index of the biggest nonfinancial stocks gained 1.39 to 446.62 .
wsj_0048	6	The index of the 100 largest Nasdaq financial stocks rose modestly as well , gaining 1.28 to 449.04 .
wsj_0048	7	But the broader Nasdaq bank index , which tracks thrift issues , jumped 3.23 to 436.01 .
wsj_0048	8	The bank stocks got a boost when Connecticut Bank & Trust and Bank of New England said they no longer oppose pending legislation that would permit banks from other regions to merge with Connecticut and Massachusetts banks .
wsj_0048	9	The two banks merged in 1985 .
wsj_0048	10	Bank of New England 's shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange .
wsj_0048	11	The stocks of banking concerns based in Massachusetts were n't helped much by the announcement , traders said , because many of those concerns have financial problems tied to their real-estate loan portfolios , making them unattractive takeover targets .
wsj_0048	12	But speculators , anticipating that Connecticut will approve a law permitting such interstate banking soon , immediately bid up shares of Connecticut banks on the news .
wsj_0048	13	`` A lot of the stocks that have been under water finally saw a reason to uptick , '' said George Jennison , head trader of banking issues in Shearson Lehman Hutton 's OTC department .
wsj_0048	14	The biggest beneficiary was Northeast Bancorp , which surged 7 3/4 to 69 .
wsj_0048	15	The Stamford , Conn. , concern has agreed to a buy-out by Bank of New York in a transaction with an indicated value of about $ 100 a share that expires next August .
wsj_0048	16	Ed Macheski , a Wilton , Conn. , money manager who follows bank stocks , said the announcement effectively gives the deal `` the green light . ''
wsj_0048	17	Mr. Jennison said Northeast Bancorp also fared well because takeover stocks have returned to favor among investors .
wsj_0048	18	Another OTC bank stock involved in a buy-out deal , First Constitution Financial , was higher .
wsj_0048	19	It rose 7/8 to 18 1/4 .
wsj_0048	20	First Constitution has signed a merger agreement with WFRR L.P. and GHKM Corp. , under which all of its common shares will be acquired for $ 25 each , or $ 273.5 million .
wsj_0048	21	Among other Connecticut banks whose shares trade in the OTC market , Society for Savings Bancorp , based in Hartford , saw its stock rise 1 3/4 to 18 1/4 .
wsj_0048	22	Centerbank added 5/8 to 8 3/4 ; shares of NESB , a New London-based bank holding company , rose 5/8 to 5 7/8 .
wsj_0048	23	Among other banking issues , Pennview Savings Association leapt more than 44 % with a gain of 6 5/8 to 21 5/8 .
wsj_0048	24	The Pennsylvania bank agreed to be acquired in a merger with Univest Corp. of Pennsylvania for $ 25.50 a share .
wsj_0048	25	Valley Federal Savings & Loan , a California thrift issue , gained 1 to 4 1/4 after reporting a third-quarter loss of $ 70.7 million after an $ 89.9 million pretax charge mostly related to its mobile home financing unit .
wsj_0048	26	Dan E. Nelms , Valley Federal 's president and chief executive officer , said the one-time charge substantially eliminates future losses associated with the unit .
wsj_0048	27	He said the company 's core business remains strong .
wsj_0048	28	He also said that after the charges , and `` assuming no dramatic fluctuation in interest rates , the company expects to achieve near-record earnings in 1990 . ''
wsj_0048	29	Weisfield 's surged 6 3/4 to 55 1/2 and Ratners Group 's American depositary receipts , or ADRs , gained 5/8 to 12 1/4 .
wsj_0048	30	The two concerns said they entered into a definitive merger agreement under which Ratners will begin a tender offer for all of Weisfield 's common shares for $ 57.50 each .
wsj_0048	31	Also on the takeover front , Jaguar 's ADRs rose 1/4 to 13 7/8 on turnover of 4.4 million .
wsj_0048	32	Since the British auto maker became a takeover target last month , its ADRs have jumped about 78 % .
wsj_0048	33	After troubled Heritage Media proposed acquiring POP Radio in a stock swap , POP Radio 's shares tumbled 4 to 14 3/4 .
wsj_0048	34	Heritage Media , which already owns about 51 % of POP Radio , proposed paying POP Radio shareholders with shares of a new class of Heritage Media preferred stock that would be convertible into four shares of Heritage Media 's common .
wsj_0048	35	Rally 's lost 1 3/4 to 21 3/4 .
wsj_0048	36	The restaurant operator said it has redeemed its rights issued Monday under its shareholder rights plan .
wsj_0048	37	The fast-food company said its decision was based on discussions with a shareholder group , Giant Group Ltd. , `` in an effort to resolve certain disputes with the company . ''
wsj_0048	38	Giant Group is led by three Rally 's directors , Burt Sugarman , James M. Trotter III and William E. Trotter II , who earlier this month indicated they had a 42.5 % stake in Rally 's and planned to seek a majority of seats on Rally 's nine-member board .
wsj_0048	39	SCI Systems slipped 7/8 to 10 on volume of 858,000 shares .
wsj_0048	40	The Huntsville , Ala. , electronic products maker said it expects to post a `` significant '' loss for its fiscal first quarter ended Sept. 30 .
wsj_0048	41	In the year-earlier period , SCI had net income of $ 4.8 million , or 23 cents a share , on revenue of $ 225.6 million .
wsj_0049	0	The Internal Revenue Service has threatened criminal sanctions against lawyers who fail to report detailed information about clients who pay them more than $ 10,000 in cash .
wsj_0049	1	The warnings , issued to at least 100 criminal defense attorneys in several major cities in the last week , have led to an outcry by members of the organized bar , who claim the information is protected by attorney-client privilege .
wsj_0049	2	The IRS warnings stem from a 1984 law that requires anyone who receives more than $ 10,000 in cash from a client or customer in one or more related transactions `` in the course of trade or business '' to report the payment on a document known as Form 8300 .
wsj_0049	3	The form asks for such details as the client 's name , Social Security number , passport number and details about the services provided for the payment .
wsj_0049	4	Failure to complete the form had been punishable as a misdemeanor until last November , when Congress determined that the crime was a felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison .
wsj_0049	5	Attorneys have argued since 1985 , when the law took effect , that they can not provide information about clients who do n't wish their identities to be known .
wsj_0049	6	Many attorneys have returned incomplete forms to the IRS in recent years , citing attorney-client privilege .
wsj_0049	7	Until last week , the IRS rarely acted on the incomplete forms .
wsj_0049	8	`` This form forces a lawyer to become , in effect , a witness against his client , '' said Neal R. Sonnett , president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers .
wsj_0049	9	`` The IRS is asking lawyers to red-flag a criminal problem to the government , '' added Mr. Sonnett , a Miami lawyer who has heard from dozens of attorneys who received letters in recent days and has himself received the computer-generated IRS forms sent by certified mail .
wsj_0049	10	Mr. Sonnett said that clients who pay cash may include alleged drug dealers who do n't have domestic bank accounts .
wsj_0049	11	These individuals may not necessarily be under investigation when they hire lawyers .
wsj_0049	12	Mr. Sonnett said there also may be other circumstances under which individuals would n't want the government to know they had retained criminal defense lawyers .
wsj_0049	13	Filling out detailed forms about these individuals would tip the IRS off and spark action against the clients , he said .
wsj_0049	14	The defense lawyers ' group formed a task force this week , chaired by New York attorney Gerald Lefcourt , to deal with the matter .
wsj_0049	15	The American Bar Association 's House of Delegates passed a resolution in 1985 condemning the IRS reporting requirement .
wsj_0049	16	Michael Ross , a New York lawyer who heads the ABA 's grand jury committee , said that lawyers are prohibited by the ABA 's code of ethics from disclosing information about a client except where a court orders it or to prevent the client from committing a criminal act that could result in death .
wsj_0049	17	Mr. Ross said he met with officials of the IRS and the Justice Department , which would bring any enforcement actions against taxpayers , to discuss the issue last May .
wsj_0049	18	At that meeting , he said , the Justice Department assured him that enforcement procedures would n't be threatened against attorneys without further review and advance notice .
wsj_0049	19	Mr. Ross said IRS officials opposed the Justice Department 's moderate stance on the matter .
wsj_0049	20	But in the letters sent in recent days , Christopher J. Lezovich of the IRS computing center in Detroit , told attorneys that `` failing to voluntarily submit the requested information could result in summons enforcement action being initiated . ''
wsj_0049	21	In some cases , the IRS asked for information dating back to forms it received in 1985 .
wsj_0049	22	A spokesman for the IRS confirmed that `` there has been correspondence mailed about incomplete 8300s , '' but he declined to say why the letters were sent to lawyers now .
wsj_0049	23	Individuals familiar with the Justice Department 's policy said that Justice officials had n't any knowledge of the IRS 's actions in the last week .
wsj_0049	24	Lawyers worry that if they provide information about clients , that data could quickly end up in the hands of prosecutors .
wsj_0049	25	Prosecutors need court permission to obtain the tax returns of an individual or a business .
wsj_0049	26	But they have obtained 8300 forms without court permission and used the information to help develop criminal cases .
wsj_0049	27	Some criminal lawyers speculated that the IRS was sending the letters to test the issue .
wsj_0049	28	In a number of recent cases , federal courts have refused to recognize attorneys ' assertions that information relating to fees from clients should be confidential .
wsj_0049	29	THE WAR OVER FEDERAL JUDICIAL SALARIES takes a victim .
wsj_0049	30	Often , judges ease into more lucrative private practice with little fanfare , but not federal Judge Raul A. Ramirez in Sacramento , Calif .
wsj_0049	31	On Tuesday , the judge called a news conference to say he was quitting effective Dec. 31 to join a San Francisco law firm .
wsj_0049	32	The reason : the refusal of Congress to give federal judges a raise .
wsj_0049	33	`` A couple of my law clerks were going to pass me in three or four years , and I was afraid I was going to have to ask them for a loan , '' the judge quipped in an interview .
wsj_0049	34	Federal judges make $ 89,500 annually ; in February , Congress rejected a bill that would have increased their pay by 50 % .
wsj_0049	35	Judge Ramirez , 44 , said it is unjust for judges to make what they do .
wsj_0049	36	`` Judges are not getting what they deserve .
wsj_0049	37	You look around at professional ballplayers or accountants ... and nobody blinks an eye .
wsj_0049	38	When you become a federal judge , all of a sudden you are relegated to a paltry sum . ''
wsj_0049	39	At his new job , as partner in charge of federal litigation in the Sacramento office of Orrick , Herrington & Sutcliffe , he will make out much better .
wsj_0049	40	The judge declined to discuss his salary in detail , but said : `` I 'm going to be a high-priced lawyer . ''
wsj_0049	41	DOONESBURY CREATOR'S UNION TROUBLES are no laughing matter .
wsj_0049	42	Cartoonist Garry Trudeau is suing the Writers Guild of America East for $ 11 million , alleging it mounted a `` campaign to harass and punish '' him for crossing a screenwriters ' picket line .
wsj_0049	43	The dispute involves Darkhorse Productions Inc. , a TV production company in which Mr. Trudeau is a co-owner .
wsj_0049	44	Mr. Trudeau , a Writers Guild member , also was employed as a writer for Darkhorse , which was covered by a guild collective-bargaining agreement .
wsj_0049	45	The guild began a strike against the TV and movie industry in March 1988 .
wsj_0049	46	In his lawsuit , Mr. Trudeau says the strike illegally included Darkhorse , and the cartoonist refused to honor the strike against the company .
wsj_0049	47	A spokesman for the guild said the union 's lawyers are reviewing the suit .
wsj_0049	48	He said disciplinary proceedings are confidential and declined to comment on whether any are being held against Mr. Trudeau .
wsj_0049	49	Mr. Trudeau 's attorney , Norman K. Samnick , said the harassment consists mainly of the guild 's year-long threats of disciplinary action .
wsj_0049	50	Mr. Samnick said a guild disciplinary hearing is scheduled next Monday in New York .
wsj_0049	51	Mr. Samnick , who will go before the disciplinary panel , said the proceedings are unfair and that any punishment from the guild would be unjustified .
wsj_0049	52	In addition to the damages , the suit seeks a court order preventing the guild from punishing or retaliating against Mr. Trudeau .
wsj_0049	53	ABORTION RULING UPHELD :
wsj_0049	54	A federal appeals court upheld a lower court ruling that the U.S. can bar the use of federal funds for family-planning programs that include abortion-related services .
wsj_0049	55	A Department of Health and Human Services rule adopted in 1988 prohibits the use of so-called Title X funds for programs that assist a woman in obtaining an abortion , such as abortion counseling and referrals .
wsj_0049	56	The rule also prohibits funding for activities that `` encourage , promote or advocate abortion . ''
wsj_0049	57	Title X funds are the single largest source of federal funding for family-planning services , according to the opinion by the Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York .
wsj_0049	58	The panel ruled that the restrictions do n't violate the freedom of speech of health care providers and that the limits on counseling services do n't violate the rights of pregnant women .
wsj_0049	59	INQUIRY CLEARS TEXAS JUDGE of bias in comments on homosexual murder victims .
wsj_0049	60	Dallas District Judge Jack Hampton had sparked calls for a judicial inquiry with his remarks to the press last December , two weeks after sentencing an 18-year-old defendant to 30 years in state prison for killing two homosexual men in a city park .
wsj_0049	61	The judge was quoted as referring to the victims as `` queers '' and saying they would n't have been killed `` if they had n't been cruising the streets picking up teenage boys . ''
wsj_0049	62	But Robert R. Murray , a special master appointed by the Texas Supreme Court , said Judge Hampton did n't breach any judicial standards of fairness , although he did violate the state 's judicial code by commenting publicly on a pending case .
wsj_0049	63	Observing that the judge `` has never exhibited any bias or prejudice , '' Mr. Murray concluded that he `` would be impartial in any case involving a homosexual or prostitute '' as a victim .
wsj_0049	64	Mr. Murray also said Judge Hampton 's comments did n't discredit the judiciary or the administration of justice .
wsj_0049	65	The report is subject to review by the State Commission on Judicial Conduct , which is empowered to impose sanctions .
wsj_0049	66	GAF TRIAL goes to round three .
wsj_0049	67	Attorneys in the third stock-manipulation trial of GAF Corp. began opening arguments yesterday in the Manhattan courtroom of U.S. District Judge Mary Johnson Lowe .
wsj_0049	68	In an eight-count indictment , the government has charged GAF , a Wayne , N.J. , specialty chemical maker , and its Vice Chairman James T. Sherwin with attempting to manipulate the common stock of Union Carbide Corp. in advance of GAF 's planned sale of a large block of the stock in November 1986 .
wsj_0049	69	The first two GAF trials ended in mistrials earlier this year .
wsj_0049	70	This trial is expected to last five weeks .
wsj_0049	71	SWITCHING TO THE DEFENSE :
wsj_0049	72	A former member of the prosecution team in the Iran/Contra affair joined the Chicago firm of Mayer , Brown & Platt .
wsj_0049	73	Michael R. Bromwich , a member since January 1987 of the three-lawyer trial team in the prosecution of Oliver North , became a partner in the Washington , D.C. , office of the 520-lawyer firm .
wsj_0049	74	He will specialize in white-collar criminal defense work .
wsj_0049	75	Mr. Bromwich , 35 , also has served as deputy chief and chief of the narcotics unit for the U.S. attorney 's office for the Southern District of New York , based in Manhattan .
wsj_0050	0	Cooper Tire & Rubber Co. said it has reached an agreement in principle to buy buildings and related property in Albany , Ga. , from Bridgestone/Firestone Inc .
wsj_0050	1	Terms were n't disclosed .
wsj_0050	2	The tire maker said the buildings consist of 1.8 million square feet of office , manufacturing and warehousing space on 353 acres of land .
wsj_0051	0	Fujitsu Ltd. 's top executive took the unusual step of publicly apologizing for his company 's making bids of just one yen for several local government projects , while computer rival NEC Corp. made a written apology for indulging in the same practice .
wsj_0051	1	Meanwhile , business and government leaders rebuked the computer makers , and fretted about the broader statement the companies ' actions make about Japanese cutthroat pricing .
wsj_0051	2	Fujitsu said it bid the equivalent of less than a U.S. penny on three separate municipal contracts during the past two years .
wsj_0051	3	The company also disclosed that during that period it offered 10,000 yen , or about $ 70 , for another contract .
wsj_0051	4	But Fujitsu , Japan 's No. 1 computer maker , is n't alone .
wsj_0051	5	NEC , one of its largest domestic competitors , said it bid one yen in two separate public auctions since 1987 .
wsj_0051	6	In both cases , NEC lost the contract to Fujitsu , which made the same bid and won a tie-breaking lottery .
wsj_0051	7	All the contracts were for computer-system-design contracts and involved no hardware or software .
wsj_0051	8	The Ministry of International Trade and Industry summoned executives from the companies to `` make sure they understood '' the concern about such practices , according to a government spokesman .
wsj_0051	9	`` These cases lead to the loss of the firms ' social and international credibility , '' a ministry statement said .
wsj_0051	10	Japan 's Fair Trade Commission has said it is considering investigating the bids for possible antitrust-law violations .
wsj_0051	11	`` We would like to apologize for having caused huge trouble , '' Fujitsu President Takuma Yamamoto , read from a prepared statement as he stood before a packed news conference at his company 's downtown headquarters .
wsj_0051	12	The bids , he added , were `` contrary to common sense . ''
wsj_0051	13	NEC released a statement saying , `` We feel sorry for having caused trouble to society , '' a form of apology common in Japan for companies caught in embarrassing situations .
wsj_0051	14	Japanese companies have long had a reputation for sacrificing short-term profits to make a sale that may have long-term benefits .
wsj_0051	15	But the growing controversy comes as many practices historically accepted as normal here -- such as politicians accepting substantial gifts from businessmen or having extramarital affairs -- are coming under close ethical scrutiny .
wsj_0051	16	The fire is also fueled by growing international interest in Japanese behavior .
wsj_0051	17	So far there have been no public overseas complaints about the issue .
wsj_0051	18	But in one of the auctions in question , International Business Machines Corp. made a bid substantially higher than the Fujitsu offer , according to the municipality .
wsj_0051	19	The low-ball bids touch on issues central to the increasingly tense trade debate .
wsj_0051	20	Foreigners complain that they have limited access to government procurement in Japan , in part because Japanese companies unfairly undercut them .
wsj_0051	21	The U.S. government in recent years has accused Japanese companies of excessively slashing prices on semiconductors and supercomputers -- products Fujitsu and NEC make .
wsj_0051	22	Asked whether the bidding flap would hurt U.S.-Japan relations , Mr. Yamamoto said , `` this will be a minus factor . ''
wsj_0051	23	The `` one-yen '' controversy first came to a head last week when the city of Hiroshima announced that Fujitsu won a contract to design a computer system to map its waterworks .
wsj_0051	24	The city had expected to pay about 11 million yen $ 77,000 , but Fujitsu essentially offered to do it for free .
wsj_0051	25	Then Wednesday , Fujitsu said it made a similar bid to win a library contract in Nagano prefecture two weeks earlier .
wsj_0051	26	It also said that in July , it bid 10,000 yen to design a system for the Saitama prefectural library , and two years ago , it bid one yen to plan the telecommunications system for Wakayama prefecture .
wsj_0051	27	The company said it has offered to withdraw its bids in Hiroshima and Nagano .
wsj_0051	28	The municipalities said they have n't decided whether to try to force the company to go through with the contracts .
wsj_0051	29	Fujitsu and NEC said they were still investigating , and that knowledge of more such bids could emerge .
wsj_0051	30	Mr. Yamamoto insisted that headquarters had n't approved the bids , and that he did n't know about most of the cases until Wednesday .
wsj_0051	31	Other major Japanese computer companies contacted yesterday said they have never made such bids .
wsj_0051	32	`` One yen is not ethical , '' Michio Sasaki , an official at Keidanren , the Japan Federation of Economic Organizations , said .
wsj_0051	33	`` Profit may be low , but at least costs should be covered .

wsj_0054	0	Furukawa Co. of Japan said it will acquire two construction machinery plants and a sales unit in France formerly belonging to Dresser Industries Inc. of the U.S. .
wsj_0054	1	The company said it made the purchase in order to locally produce hydraulically operated shovels .
wsj_0054	2	Last October , the company also bought a wheel-loader manufacturing plant in Heidelberg , West Germany , from Dresser .
wsj_0054	3	Furukawa said the purchase of the French and German plants together will total about 40 billion yen $ 280 million .

wsj_0057	0	LSI Logic Corp. reported a surprise $ 35.7 million third-quarter net loss , including a special restructuring charge that reflects a continuing industry-wide slowdown in semiconductor demand .
wsj_0057	1	In September , the custom-chip maker said excess capacity and lagging billings would result in an estimated $ 2 million to $ 3 million net loss for the third quarter .
wsj_0057	2	But company officials said yesterday that they decided to take a $ 43 million pretax charge for the period to cover a restructuring of world-wide manufacturing operations , citing extended weakness in the market as well as a decision to switch to more economical production techniques .
wsj_0057	3	`` Over the summer months , there has been a slowing in the rate of new orders from the computer sector , our primary market , '' said Wilfred J. Corrigan , chairman and chief executive officer .
wsj_0057	4	`` In addition , recent industry forecasts for 1990 indicate a slow environment , at least until midyear . ''
wsj_0057	5	As a result , the company said it decided to phase out its oldest capacity and `` make appropriate reductions '' in operating expenses .
wsj_0057	6	The $ 35.7 million net loss equals 86 cents a share .
wsj_0057	7	Not counting the extraordinary charge , the company said it would have had a net loss of $ 3.1 million , or seven cents a share .
wsj_0057	8	A year earlier , it had profit of $ 7.5 million , or 18 cents a share .
wsj_0057	9	Revenue rose 42 % to $ 133.7 million from $ 94 million .
wsj_0057	10	The charge partly reflects a switch from older five-inch to more-efficient six-inch silicon wafers with which to fabricate chips .
wsj_0057	11	Related to that decision , the company said it was converting its Santa Clara , Calif. , factory to a research and development facility .
wsj_0057	12	A spokesman declined to speculate about possible reductions in force .
wsj_0057	13	`` This is a company that has invested in capacity additions more aggressively than any other company in the industry and now the industry is growing more slowly and they are suddenly poorly positioned , '' said Michael Stark , chip analyst at Robertson , Stephens & Co .
wsj_0057	14	`` I think the stock is dead money for a while . ''
wsj_0057	15	Yesterday 's announcement was made after markets closed .
wsj_0057	16	U.S. chip makers are facing continued slack demand following a traditionally slow summer .
wsj_0057	17	Part of the problem is that chip buyers are keeping inventories low because of jitters about the course of the U.S. economy .

wsj_0060	0	`` The Cosby Show '' may have single-handedly turned around ratings at NBC since its debut in 1984 , and the Huxtable family still keeps millions of viewers laughing Thursday night on the network .
wsj_0060	1	But some of the TV stations that bought `` Cosby '' reruns for record prices two years ago are n't laughing much these days .
wsj_0060	2	The reruns have helped ratings at many of the 187 network affiliates and independent TV stations that air the shows .
wsj_0060	3	But the ratings are considerably below expectations , and some stations say they may not buy new episodes when their current contracts expire .
wsj_0060	4	Meanwhile , stations are fuming because , many of them say , the show 's distributor , Viacom Inc. , is giving an ultimatum : Either sign new long-term commitments to buy future episodes or risk losing `` Cosby '' to a competitor .
wsj_0060	5	At the same time , Viacom is trying to persuade stations to make commitments to `` A Different World , '' a spin-off of `` Cosby '' whose reruns will become available in 1991 .
wsj_0060	6	Viacom denies it 's using pressure tactics .
wsj_0060	7	`` We 're willing to negotiate , '' says Dennis Gillespie , executive vice president of marketing .
wsj_0060	8	`` We 're offering this plan now because we feel it 's the right time . ''
wsj_0060	9	But , says the general manager of a network affiliate in the Midwest , `` I think if I tell them I need more time , they 'll take ` Cosby ' across the street , ''
wsj_0060	10	Viacom 's move comes as the syndication market is being flooded with situation comedies that are still running on the networks .
wsj_0060	11	One station manager says he believes Viacom 's move is a `` pre-emptive strike '' because the company is worried that `` Cosby '' ratings will continue to drop in syndication over the next few years .
wsj_0060	12	`` Cosby '' is down a full ratings point in the week of Oct. 2-8 over the same week a year ago , according to A.C. Nielsen Co .
wsj_0060	13	Mr. Gillespie at Viacom says the ratings are rising .
wsj_0060	14	And executives at stations in such major markets as Washington ; Providence , R.I. ; Cleveland ; Raleigh , N.C. ; Minneapolis , and Louisville , Ky. , say they may very well not renew `` Cosby . ''
wsj_0060	15	Dick Lobo , the general manager of WTVJ , the NBC-owned station in Miami , for example , says the show has `` been a major disappointment to us . ''
wsj_0060	16	`` At the prices we were charged , there should have been some return for the dollar .
wsj_0060	17	There was n't . ''
wsj_0060	18	Neil Kuvin , the general manager of WHAS , the CBS affiliate in Louisville , says `` Cosby '' gets the station 's highest ratings and he 's `` pleased . ''
wsj_0060	19	But he adds , `` I feel pressured , disappointed , uncomfortable and , frankly , quite angry with Viacom .

wsj_0063	0	Sea Containers Ltd. said it might increase the price of its $ 70-a-share buy-back plan if pressed by Temple Holdings Ltd. , which made an earlier tender offer for Sea Containers .
wsj_0063	1	Sea Containers , a Hamilton , Bermuda-based shipping concern , said Tuesday that it would sell $ 1.1 billion of assets and use some of the proceeds to buy about 50 % of its common shares for $ 70 apiece .
wsj_0063	2	The move is designed to ward off a hostile takeover attempt by two European shipping concerns , Stena Holding AG and Tiphook PLC .
wsj_0063	3	In May , the two companies , through their jointly owned holding company , Temple , offered $ 50 a share , or $ 777 million , for Sea Containers .
wsj_0063	4	In August , Temple sweetened the offer to $ 63 a share , or $ 963 million .
wsj_0063	5	Yesterday , Sea Containers ' chief executive officer , James Sherwood , said in an interview that , under the asset-sale plan , Sea Containers would end up with a cash surplus of approximately $ 620 million .
wsj_0063	6	About $ 490 million of that would be allocated to the buy-back , leaving about $ 130 million , he said .
wsj_0063	7	That $ 130 million , Mr. Sherwood said , `` gives us some flexibility in case Temple raises its bid .
wsj_0063	8	We are able to increase our price above the $ 70 level if necessary .
wsj_0063	9	'' He declined to say , however , how much Sea Containers might raise its price .
wsj_0063	10	Mr. Sherwood speculated that the leeway that Sea Containers has means that Temple would have to `` substantially increase their bid if they 're going to top us . ''
wsj_0063	11	Temple , however , harshly criticized Sea Containers ' plan yesterday , characterizing it as a `` highly conditional device designed to entrench management , confuse shareholders and prevent them from accepting our superior cash offer . ''
wsj_0063	12	A spokesman for Temple estimated that Sea Containers ' plan -- if all the asset sales materialize -- would result in shareholders receiving only $ 36 to $ 45 a share in cash .
wsj_0063	13	The lower figures , the spokesman said , would stem from preferred shares being converted to common stock and the possibility that Sea Containers ' subsidiaries might be required to place their shares in the open market .
wsj_0063	14	Temple added that Sea Containers is still mired in legal problems in Bermuda , where the Supreme Court has temporarily barred Sea Containers from buying back its own stock in a case brought by Stena and Tiphook .
wsj_0063	15	The court has indicated it will rule on the case by the end of the month . )
wsj_0063	16	Temple also said Sea Containers ' plan raises `` numerous legal , regulatory , financial and fairness issues , '' but did n't elaborate .
wsj_0063	17	Mr. Sherwood said reaction to Sea Containers ' proposal has been `` very positive . ''
wsj_0063	18	In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , Sea Containers closed at $ 62.625 , up 62.5 cents .
wsj_0064	0	The Transportation Department , responding to pressure from safety advocates , took further steps to impose on light trucks and vans the safety requirements used for automobiles .
wsj_0064	1	The department proposed requiring stronger roofs for light trucks and minivans , beginning with 1992 models .
wsj_0064	2	It also issued a final rule requiring auto makers to equip light trucks and minivans with lap-shoulder belts for rear seats beginning in the 1992 model year .
wsj_0064	3	Such belts already are required for the vehicles ' front seats .
wsj_0064	4	`` Today 's action , '' Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner said , `` represents another milestone in the ongoing program to promote vehicle occupant safety in light trucks and minivans through its extension of passenger car standards . ''
wsj_0064	5	In September , the department had said it will require trucks and minivans to be equipped with the same front-seat headrests that have long been required on passenger cars .
wsj_0064	6	The Big Three auto makers said the rule changes were n't surprising because Bush administration officials have long said they planned to impose car safety standards on light trucks and vans .
wsj_0064	7	Safety advocates , including some members of Congress , have been urging the department for years to extend car-safety requirements to light trucks and vans , which now account for almost one-third of all vehicle sales in the U.S. .
wsj_0064	8	They say that many vehicles classed as commercial light trucks actually carry more people than cargo and therefore should have the same safety features as cars .
wsj_0064	9	They did n't have much luck during the Reagan administration .
wsj_0064	10	`` But now , there seems to be a fairly systematic effort to address the problem , '' said Chuck Hurley , vice president of communications for the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety .
wsj_0064	11	`` We 're in a very different regulatory environment . ''
wsj_0064	12	Sen. John Danforth R. , Mo . praised the department 's actions , noting that rollover crashes account for almost half of all light-truck deaths .
wsj_0064	13	`` We could prevent many of these fatalities with minimum roof-crush standards , '' he said .
wsj_0064	14	Sen. Danforth and others also want the department to require additional safety equipment in light trucks and minivans , including air bags or automatic seat belts in front seats and improved side-crash protection .
wsj_0064	15	The department 's roof-crush proposal would apply to vehicles weighing 10,000 pounds or less .
wsj_0064	16	The roofs would be required to withstand a force of 1.5 times the unloaded weight of the vehicle .
wsj_0064	17	During the test , the roof could n't be depressed more than five inches .
wsj_0064	18	In Detroit , a Chrysler Corp. official said the company currently has no rear-seat lap and shoulder belts in its light trucks , but plans to begin phasing them in by the end of the 1990 model year .
wsj_0064	19	He said Chrysler fully expects to have them installed across its light-truck line by the Sept. 1 , 1991 , deadline .
wsj_0064	20	Chrysler said its trucks and vans already meet the roof-crush resistance standard for cars .
wsj_0064	21	John Leinonen , executive engineer of Ford Motor Co. 's auto-safety office , said Ford trucks have met car standards for roof-crush resistance since 1982 .
wsj_0064	22	Ford began installing the rear-seat belts in trucks with its F-series Crew Cab pickups in the 1989 model year .
wsj_0064	23	The new Explorer sport-utility vehicle , set for introduction next spring , will also have the rear-seat belts .
wsj_0064	24	Mr. Leinonen said he expects Ford to meet the deadline easily .

wsj_0072	0	Signs of a slowing economy are increasing pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut short-term interest rates , but it is n't clear whether the central bank will do so .
wsj_0072	1	A survey by the Fed 's 12 district banks shows economic growth has been sluggish in recent weeks , while upward pressures on prices have moderated .
wsj_0072	2	`` The economy is clearly slowing , '' says Robert Black , president of the Richmond Federal Reserve Bank .
wsj_0072	3	`` If you look at the third quarter as posting roughly 2.5 % growth , I do see some slowing in the fourth quarter , '' agrees Kansas City Fed President Roger Guffey .
wsj_0072	4	Nevertheless , both Mr. Guffey and Mr. Black say the slowdown so far is no cause for concern .
wsj_0072	5	`` We 're coming closer to achieving the stated objective of slowing the economy to a point where hopefully some downward trend in prices will occur , '' said Mr. Guffey .
wsj_0072	6	Bush administration officials are looking to the Fed to bring down rates , and financial markets seem to be expecting easier credit as well .
wsj_0072	7	`` I think the market had been expecting the Fed to ease sooner and a little more than it has to date , '' said Robert Johnson , vice president of global markets for Bankers Trust Co .
wsj_0072	8	The Fed cut the key federal funds interest rate by about 0.25 percentage point to 8.75 % after the Oct. 13 stock market plunge , but has shown no sign of movement since .
wsj_0072	9	The report from the Fed found that manufacturing , in particular , has been weak in recent weeks .
wsj_0072	10	The Philadelphia Fed , for instance , reported that manufacturing activity `` continues to decline '' for the fourth month in a row .
wsj_0072	11	And in the Chicago district , the report said , `` a manufacturer of capital goods noted slower orders for some types , including defense equipment , petroleum equipment , food packaging machinery and material handling equipment . ''
wsj_0072	12	Retail sales also were reported slow in most districts , particularly `` for discretionary , big-ticket items such as furniture , home appliances and consumer electronics . ''
wsj_0072	13	And construction also was described as slow in most areas .
wsj_0072	14	Despite the economic slowdown , there are few clear signs that growth is coming to a halt .
wsj_0072	15	As a result , Fed officials may be divided over whether to ease credit .
wsj_0072	16	Several Fed governors in Washington have been pushing for easier credit ; but many of the regional Fed presidents have been resisting such a move .
wsj_0072	17	Mr. Black said he is `` pleased '' with the economy 's recent performance , and does n't see `` a lot of excesses out there that would tilt us into recession . ''
wsj_0072	18	`` There is always a chance of recession , '' added Mr. Guffey , `` but if you ask me to put a percentage on it , I would think it 's well below a 50 % chance .

wsj_0075	0	The Treasury said it plans to sell $ 30 billion in notes and bonds next week , but said the auctions will be postponed unless Congress acts quickly to lift the federal debt ceiling .
wsj_0075	1	Michael Basham , deputy assistant secretary for federal finance , said the Treasury may wait until late Monday or even early Tuesday to announce whether the autions are to be rescheduled .
wsj_0075	2	Unless it can raise money in financial markets , Mr. Basham said , the federal government wo n't have the cash to pay off $ 13.8 billion in Treasury bills that mature on Thursday .
wsj_0075	3	Without congressional action , the Treasury ca n't sell any new securities -- even savings bonds .
wsj_0075	4	But despite partisan bickering over the debt ceiling , which has become entangled in the fight over cutting capital-gains taxes , Congress is almost certain to act in time to avoid default .
wsj_0075	5	`` Each day that Congress fails to act ... will cause additional disruption in our borrowing schedule , possibly resulting in higher interest costs to the taxpayer , '' Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said in a speech prepared for delivery last night to a group of bankers .
wsj_0075	6	`` To avoid these costs , and a possible default , immediate action is imperative . ''
wsj_0075	7	The securities to be sold next week will raise about $ 10 billion in cash and redeem $ 20 billion in maturing notes .
wsj_0075	8	The new securities , part of the federal government 's regular quarterly refunding , will consist of :
wsj_0075	9	-- $ 10 billion of three-year notes , to be auctioned Tuesday and to mature Nov. 15 , 1992 .
wsj_0075	10	-- $ 10 billion of 10-year notes , to be auctioned Wednesday and to mature Nov. 15 , 1999 .
wsj_0075	11	-- $ 10 billion of 30-year bonds , to be auctioned Thursday and to mature Aug. 15 , 2019 .
wsj_0075	12	The Treasury also said it plans to sell $ 10 billion in 36-day cash management bills on Thursday .
wsj_0075	13	They will mature Dec. 21 .
wsj_0075	14	None of the securities will be eligible for when-issued trading until Congress approves an increase in the debt ceiling , clearing the way for a formal offering , Mr. Basham said .
wsj_0075	15	The Treasury said it needs to raise $ 47.5 billion in the current quarter in order to end December with a $ 20 billion cash balance .
wsj_0075	16	Auctions held in October and those scheduled for next week will raise a total of $ 25.6 billion .
wsj_0075	17	The remaining $ 21.9 billion could be raised through the sale of short-term Treasury bills , two-year notes in November and five-year notes in early December , the Treasury said .
wsj_0075	18	In the first three months of 1990 , the Treasury estimates that it will have to raise between $ 45 billion and $ 50 billion , assuming that it decides to aim for a $ 10 billion cash balance at the end of March .

wsj_0080	0	Investor Harold Simmons and NL Industries Inc. offered to acquire Georgia Gulf Corp. for $ 50 a share , or about $ 1.1 billion , stepping up the pressure on the commodity chemicals concern .
wsj_0080	1	The offer follows an earlier proposal by NL and Mr. Simmons to help Georgia Gulf restructure or go private in a transaction that would pay shareholders $ 55 a share .
wsj_0080	2	Georgia Gulf rebuffed that offer in September and said it would study other alternatives .
wsj_0080	3	However , it has n't yet made any proposals to shareholders .
wsj_0080	4	Late yesterday , Georgia Gulf said it reviewed the NL proposal as well as interests from `` third parties '' regarding business combinations .
wsj_0080	5	Georgia Gulf said it has n't eliminated any alternatives and that `` discussions are being held with interested parties , and work is also continuing on other various transactions . ''
wsj_0080	6	It did n't elaborate .
wsj_0080	7	Analysts saw the latest offer as proof that Mr. Simmons , an aggressive and persistent investor , wo n't leave Georgia Gulf alone until some kind of transaction is completed .
wsj_0080	8	`` He has clamped on their ankle like a pit bull , '' says Paul Leming , a vice president with Morgan Stanley & Co .
wsj_0080	9	`` He appears to be in it for the long haul . ''
wsj_0080	10	Mr. Simmons and NL already own a 9.9 % stake in Georgia Gulf .
wsj_0080	11	Mr. Simmons owns 88 % of Valhi Inc. , which in turn owns two-thirds of NL .
wsj_0080	12	NL is officially making the offer .
wsj_0080	13	Mr. Leming was n't surprised by the lower price cited by NL , saying he believes that $ 55 a share is `` the most you can pay for Georgia Gulf before it becomes a bad acquisition . ''
wsj_0080	14	Georgia Gulf stock rose $ 1.75 a share yesterday to close at $ 51.25 a share , while NL shares closed unchanged at $ 22.75 and Valhi rose 62.5 cents to $ 15 , all in New York Stock Exchange composite trading .
wsj_0080	15	J. Landis Martin , NL president and chief executive officer , said NL and Mr. Simmons cut the price they were proposing for Georgia Gulf because they initially planned a transaction that included about $ 250 million in equity and a substantial amount of high-yield subordinated debt .
wsj_0080	16	However , the junk-bond market has collapsed in recent weeks , lessening the likelihood that such a transaction would succeed .
wsj_0080	17	Now , he said , the group plans to put in `` several hundred million '' dollars in equity and finance the remainder with bank debt .
wsj_0080	18	He also said that the group reduced its offer because it was n't allowed to see Georgia Gulf 's confidential financial information without agreeing that it would n't make an offer unless it had Georgia Gulf 's consent .
wsj_0080	19	In a letter to Georgia Gulf President Jerry R. Satrum , Mr. Martin asked Georgia Gulf to answer its offer by Tuesday .
wsj_0080	20	It was n't clear how NL and Mr. Simmons would respond if Georgia Gulf spurns them again .
wsj_0080	21	Mr. Martin said they have n't yet decided what their next move would be , but he did n't rule out the possibility of a consent solicitation aimed at replacing Georgia Gulf 's board .
wsj_0080	22	In other transactions , Mr. Simmons has followed friendly offers with a hostile tender offer .
wsj_0080	23	Although Georgia Gulf has n't been eager to negotiate with Mr. Simmons and NL , a specialty chemicals concern , the group apparently believes the company 's management is interested in some kind of transaction .
wsj_0080	24	The management group owns about 18 % of the stock , most purchased at nominal prices , and would stand to gain millions of dollars if the company were sold .
wsj_0080	25	In the third quarter , Georgia Gulf earned $ 46.1 million , or $ 1.85 a share , down from $ 53 million , or $ 1.85 a share on fewer shares outstanding .
wsj_0080	26	Sales fell to $ 251.2 million from $ 278.7 million .
wsj_0081	0	A licensing company representing the University of Pennsylvania added Johnson & Johnson to its lawsuit challenging a university faculty member over rights to Retin-A acne medicine .
wsj_0081	1	University Patents Inc. , based in Westport , Conn. , said it seeks Johnson & Johnson 's profits from sales of Retin-A , estimated at $ 50 million , a similar amount of punitive damages and the right to license Retin-A elsewhere .
wsj_0081	2	In May , University Patents filed a suit in federal court in Philadelphia against Albert M. Kligman , a researcher and professor at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine who developed Retin-A in the 1960s to combat acne .
wsj_0081	3	Dr. Kligman patented the medicine while employed by the University , but later licensed the Retin-A to a division of Johnson & Johnson .
wsj_0081	4	In New Brunswick , N.J. , a Johnson & Johnson spokesman declined comment .
wsj_0084	0	Hudson General Corp. 's president and chief executive officer , Alan J. Stearn , resigned .
wsj_0084	1	Mr. Stearn , 46 years old , could n't be reached for comment .
wsj_0084	2	A company spokesman declined to elaborate on the departure .
wsj_0084	3	Hudson General , which provides maintenance , fueling and other services to airlines and airports , reported a loss for its most recent fiscal year and last month omitted the semiannual dividend on its common shares .
wsj_0084	4	Mr. Stearn , who had been with the company more than 20 years and had been president since 1984 , will act as a consultant to Hudson General .
wsj_0084	5	His duties as chief executive will be assumed by Chairman Jay B. Langner .
wsj_0086	0	SHAREDATA Inc. said it will amend a registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to delete a plan to sell 500,000 newly issued common shares .
wsj_0086	1	The Chandler , Ariz. , company said it will resubmit the registration to cover only the 2.3 million warrants , each exercisable for the purchase of one common share .
wsj_0086	2	Currently , ShareData has about 4.1 million common shares outstanding .

wsj_0087	0	Five things you can do for $ 15,000 or less :
wsj_0087	1	1 . Buy a new Chevrolet .
wsj_0087	2	2 . Take a Hawaiian vacation .
wsj_0087	3	3 . Send your child to a university .
wsj_0087	4	4 . Buy a diamond necklace .
wsj_0087	5	5 . Make a lasting difference in the regulatory life of an American savings-and-loan association through the Foster Corporate Parents Plan .
wsj_0087	6	Americans today spend $ 15,000 like pocket change -- they do n't think much about it .
wsj_0087	7	But for an ailing savings-and-loan association -- teetering on insolvency -- it can lead to safety from imminent demise and to a future full of promise .
wsj_0087	8	Your $ 15,000 will help keep a needy savings and loan solvent -- and out of the federal budget deficit .
wsj_0087	9	As a Foster Corporate Parent , you 'll be helping a neighborhood S&L in areas crucial to its survival .
wsj_0087	10	Like healthy regulatory capital .
wsj_0087	11	A steady deposit base .
wsj_0087	12	At the same time , you 'll give your Foster Savings Institution the gift of hope and freedom from the federal regulators who want to close its doors -- for good .
wsj_0087	13	As a Foster Corporate Parent , you will experience the same joy felt by Robert Bass , Lewis Ranieri , William Simon and others , who find ways to help troubled savings institutions and their employees help themselves .
wsj_0087	14	That builds confidence , self sufficiency , not to mention critical regulatory net worth .
wsj_0087	15	Do n't wait -- a savings institution needs your help now !
wsj_0087	16	Every day you delay , a savings institution 's health -- and the federal budget deficit -- grows worse .
wsj_0087	17	Think about the good you can do for just $ 15,000 a month , about the cost of a mid-size Chevrolet or two semesters at a state university .
wsj_0087	18	Then send your support to a savings institution that has taken a bad rap in the press and on its bottom line .
wsj_0087	19	Every $ 15,000 you send will go a long way to boost sagging net worth and employee morale -- and keep your Foster Savings Institution off the federal budget deficit !
wsj_0087	20	Mr. Baris is a lawyer in New York .
wsj_0088	0	The Chicago Mercantile Exchange said it plans to institute an additional `` circuit breaker '' aimed at stemming market slides .
wsj_0088	1	Separately , John Phelan told a closed House subcommittee meeting in Washington that he would support Securities and Exchange Commission halts of program trading during market emergencies .
wsj_0088	2	But the New York Stock Exchange chairman said he does n't support reinstating a `` collar '' on program trading , arguing that firms could get around such a limit .
wsj_0088	3	The Chicago Merc said a new one-hour price limit would take effect in its Standard & Poor 's 500 stock-index futures pit once S&P 500 futures fell 20 index points -- the equivalent of about a 150-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average .
wsj_0088	4	If the 20-point limit is triggered after 1:30 p.m . Chicago time , it would remain in effect until the normal close of trading at 3:15 p.m .
wsj_0088	5	With the limit in effect , members would be able to execute trades at the limit price or at higher prices , but not below it .
wsj_0088	6	The exchange said it decided a new circuit breaker was needed following a review of the tumultuous trading in stocks and stock-index futures on Friday Oct. 13 , when the Dow Jones industrials plunged 190 points and stock-index futures prices skidded as well .
wsj_0088	7	Late that afternoon the S&P 500 stock-index futures contract fell a total of 30 index points , hitting a Merc circuit breaker limit that remained in effect for the rest of the trading session .
wsj_0088	8	The Merc said that its existing 30-minute , 12-point limit on S&P 500 stock-index futures trading equal to about 100 points on the Dow Jones industrials , which was triggered Oct. 13 , will remain in effect .
wsj_0088	9	Leo Melamed , Merc executive committee chairman , said that the 12-point limit appeared to lessen the selling panic Oct. 13 .
wsj_0088	10	But when the contract reopened , the subsequent flood of sell orders that quickly knocked the contract down to the 30-point limit indicated that the intermediate limit of 20 points was needed to help keep stock and stock-index futures prices synchronized .
wsj_0088	11	Several traders maintained that the Merc 's 12-point circuit-breaker aggravated the market slide Oct. 13 by directing additional selling pressure to the floor of the New York Stock Exchange .
wsj_0088	12	All of the changes require regulatory approval , which is expected shortly .
wsj_0088	13	The exchange also said that the 30-point circuit breaker , which currently provides only a one-hour respite during market sell-offs , will become the maximum one-day limit for the S&P 500 stock-index futures contract ; the one-day limit now is 50 index points .
wsj_0088	14	A final modification was made to the five-point opening limit for the contract .
wsj_0088	15	The Merc said that five-point limit will remain in effect for the first 10 minutes of trading .
wsj_0088	16	The limit lapses under current exchange rules if contracts trade above the limit price during the opening 10 minutes of trading .
wsj_0088	17	In Washington , House aides said Mr. Phelan told congressmen that the collar , which banned program trades through the Big Board 's computer when the Dow Jones Industrial Average moved 50 points , did n't work well .
wsj_0088	18	He said that firms could get around the collar by executing trades manually .
wsj_0088	19	In a post-hearing news conference , Mr. Phelan , who has publicly expressed concern about market volatility , said he told the House finance and telecommunications subcommittee that he would support the program-trading halt proposal `` providing the SEC would be comfortable with the language '' in a bill .
wsj_0088	20	The program-trading issue is heating up on Capitol Hill as it is on Wall Street , and several legislators want to grant the SEC the power to shut off the programs when trading becomes too volatile .
wsj_0088	21	SEC Chairman Richard Breeden has said he would be willing to consider circuit breakers that have preset trigger points , but he does n't want discretionary power to stop programs .
wsj_0088	22	A House aide suggested that Mr. Phelan was so `` vague and mushy '' that it was the kind of meeting where people of all viewpoints could `` come out feeling good . ''
wsj_0088	23	At one point , Mr. Phelan angered the subcommittee 's chairman , Rep. Edward Markey D. , Mass. , by not going much beyond what already had been reported in the morning newspapers .
wsj_0088	24	`` Markey said we could have done this in public '' because so little sensitive information was disclosed , the aide said .
wsj_0088	25	Mr. Phelan then responded that he would have been happy just writing a report to the panel , the aide added .
wsj_0088	26	At another point during the hearing , Rep. Markey asked Mr. Phelan what would be discussed at a New York exchange board meeting today .
wsj_0088	27	Mr. Phelan said the Big Board is likely to study the program-trading issue .
wsj_0088	28	That response annoyed Rep. Markey , House aides said , and the congressman snapped back that there had been enough studies of the issue and that it was time for action on the matter .
wsj_0088	29	Fifteen of the 26 subcommittee members attended the hearing , most notably Rep. John Dingell D. , Mich. , the full House Energy and Commerce Committee chairman , who has been willing to let Mr. Markey carry the legislation in recent months .
wsj_0088	30	Mr. Dingell expressed concern , sources said , about jurisdictional problems in regulating program trading , which uses futures to offset stock trades .
wsj_0088	31	The futures industry is regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission , which reports to the Agriculture committees in both houses .
wsj_0091	0	Your Oct. 13 page-one story on the renewed plight of Western Union says that Western Union had lost its chance to be in the telephone business by turning down Alexander Graham Bell 's offer to it of his invention , because it supposedly felt that voice communication would never replace the telegraph .
wsj_0091	1	Such is hardly the case .
wsj_0091	2	Bell 's father-in-law , Gardner G. Hubbard , wealthy and well-connected , obtained financing to start the American Bell Telephone Co. in Boston , which even had a subsidiary in New York called the Telephone Co. of New York .
wsj_0091	3	This is where Bell 's patents went .
wsj_0091	4	Western Union indeed wanted to get into the telephone business .
wsj_0091	5	It acquired Thomas Edison 's microphone patent and then immediately sued the Bell Co. claiming that the microphone invented by my grandfather , Emile Berliner , which had been sold to Bell for a princely $ 50,000 , infringed upon Western Union 's Edison patent .
wsj_0091	6	When Bell established that the Berliner patent caveat was registered 10 days before Edison 's application , Western Union dropped the lawsuit and agreed never to enter the telephone business -- the basis for the company 's current plight .

wsj_0094	1	The Japanese industrial companies should know better .
wsj_0094	2	They are barking up the wrong tree , because it is basically their fault they ca n't attract new employees .
wsj_0094	3	Takuma Yamamoto , president of Fujitsu Ltd. , believes `` the ` money worship ' among young people ... caused the problem . ''
wsj_0094	4	He is just passing the buck to young people .
wsj_0094	5	What 's wrong with asking for more money ?
wsj_0094	6	Money is not everything , but it is necessary , and business is not volunteer work .
wsj_0094	7	It is not unethical to choose a higher-salaried job .
wsj_0094	8	Unfortunately , Japanese manufacturers have neither good working conditions nor good compensation packages .
wsj_0094	9	I get the impression that some Japanese managers believe working harder for less money is beautiful .
wsj_0094	10	I visited a lot of major Japanese manufacturers , but I never felt I would want to be employed by any of them .
wsj_0094	11	Many of them recently have been spending a lot of money on public relations and advertising to improve their images , but they should realize that the most important thing is real change , not changing people 's perceptions .
wsj_0094	12	If the Japanese companies are seriously considering their survival , they could do at least three things to improve the situation : raise salaries higher than those of financial institutions ; improve working conditions better offices and more vacations , for example ; accept and hire more labor from outside Japan .
wsj_0095	0	In reference to your Oct. 9 page-one article `` Barbara Bush Earns Even Higher Ratings Than the President , '' it is regrettable that you must continually define blacks by our negatives : `` Among liberals , 60 % have positive views of her , while 50 % approve of the president 's job performance .
wsj_0095	1	In part , this may reflect the fact that ` she speaks a more progressive language ' than her husband , as Columbia 's Prof . Ethel Klein puts it .
wsj_0095	2	Among professionals , 76 % have a favorable opinion of her , compared to 62 % who approve of her husband 's performance .
wsj_0095	3	While a quarter of black voters disapprove of Mr. Bush 's handling of his job , only 15 % have a negative view of his spouse . ''
wsj_0095	4	The statistics imply that three-quarters of blacks approve of Mr. Bush 's job performance and 85 % of blacks approve of Mrs. Bush .
wsj_0095	5	If the assumption is that it is surprising that so few blacks find Mr. and Mrs. Bush distasteful , the positive view is even more newsworthy .
wsj_0095	6	Such an editorial point of view perpetuates an insidious , stereotyped perspective .
wsj_0095	7	Why are we blacks continually defined by our minority and the lowest common denominator .

wsj_0098	1	The vote came after a debate replete with complaints from both proponents and critics of a substantial increase in the wage floor .
wsj_0098	2	Advocates said the 90-cent-an-hour rise , to $ 4.25 an hour by April 1991 , is too small for the working poor , while opponents argued that the increase will still hurt small business and cost many thousands of jobs .
wsj_0098	3	But the legislation reflected a compromise agreed to on Tuesday by President Bush and Democratic leaders in Congress , after congressional Republicans urged the White House to bend a bit from its previous resistance to compromise .
wsj_0098	4	So both sides accepted the compromise , which would lead to the first lifting of the minimum wage since a four-year law was enacted in 1977 , raising the wage to $ 3.35 an hour from $ 2.65 .
wsj_0098	5	Under the measure passed yesterday , the minimum wage would rise to $ 3.80 next April .
wsj_0098	6	The Senate plans to take up the measure quickly and is expected to pass it .
wsj_0098	7	`` There are no smiles about this bill , '' Rep. Pat Williams D. , Mont . said during House floor debate yesterday .
wsj_0098	8	But `` because it 's all we 've got , I 'm going to vote for it . ''
wsj_0098	9	While the minimum wage had traditionally been pegged at half the average U.S. manufacturing wage , the level of $ 4.25 an hour in 1991 will still be less than 35 % of average factory pay , Mr. Williams said .
wsj_0098	10	But Rep. Marge Roukema R. , N.J . instead praised the House 's acceptance of a new youth `` training '' wage , a subminimum that GOP administrations have sought for many years .
wsj_0098	11	Adopting a training-wage policy means `` getting beyond the nickel and diming of the minimum wage , '' Mrs. Roukema said .
wsj_0098	12	Policy makers regard the youth wage as helping to limit the loss of jobs from an increase in the minimum wage , but they have lately touted it as necessary to help impart job skills to entrants into the work force .
wsj_0098	13	Labor unions and Democrats long fought the idea , but recently acceded to it in the face of Bush administration insistence .
wsj_0098	14	The compromise sets the training wage at $ 3.35 an hour next April , and at $ 3.61 an hour , or 85 % of the minimum wage , in April 1991 .
wsj_0098	15	Employers can pay the subminimum for 90 days , without restriction , to workers with less than six months of job experience , and for another 90 days if the company uses a government-certified training program for the young workers .
wsj_0098	16	The training wage covers only workers who are 16 to 19 years old .
wsj_0098	17	The White House previously insisted on an unrestricted six-month training wage that could be paid any time a worker of any age took a new job .
wsj_0098	18	The U.S. Chamber of Commerce , still opposed to any mininum-wage increase , said the compromise plan to lift the wage floor 27 % in two stages between April 1990 and April 1991 `` will be impossible for many employers to accommodate and will result in the elimination of jobs for American workers and higher prices for American consumers .
wsj_0099	0	Zenith Data Systems Corp. , a subsidiary of Zenith Electronics Corp. , received a $ 534 million Navy contract for software and services of microcomputers over an 84-month period .
wsj_0099	1	Rockwell International Corp. won a $ 130.7 million Air Force contract for AC-130U gunship replacement aircraft .
wsj_0099	2	Martin Marietta Corp. was given a $ 29.9 million Air Force contract for low-altitude navigation and targeting equipment .
wsj_0099	3	Federal Data Corp. got a $ 29.4 million Air Force contract for intelligence data handling .
wsj_0101	0	A House-Senate conference approved major portions of a package for more than $ 500 million in economic aid for Poland that relies heavily on $ 240 million in credit and loan guarantees in fiscal 1990 in hopes of stimulating future trade and investment .
wsj_0101	1	For the Agency for International Development , appropriators approved $ 200 million in secondary loan guarantees under an expanded trade credit insurance program , and total loan guarantees for the Overseas Private Investment Corp. are increased by $ 40 million over fiscal 1989 as part of the same Poland package .
wsj_0101	2	The conference approved at least $ 55 million in direct cash and development assistance as well , and though no decision was made , both sides are committed to adding more than $ 200 million in economic support funds and environmental initiatives sought by the Bush administration .
wsj_0101	3	The agreement on Poland contrasts with the major differences remaining over the underlying foreign aid bill , which has already provoked veto threats by the White House and is sharply confined under this year 's budget .
wsj_0101	4	These fiscal pressures are also a factor in shaping the Poland package , and while more ambitious authorizing legislation is still pending , the appropriations bill in conference will be more decisive on U.S. aid to Eastern Europe .
wsj_0101	5	To accommodate the additional cash assistance , the House Appropriations Committee last week was required to reallocate an estimated $ 140 million from the Pentagon .
wsj_0101	6	And though the size of the loan guarantees approved yesterday is significant , recent experience with a similar program in Central America indicates that it could take several years before the new Polish government can fully use the aid effectively .
wsj_0101	7	The action on Poland came as the conference separately approved $ 220 million for international population planning activities , an 11 % increase over fiscal 1989 .
wsj_0101	8	The House and Senate are divided over whether the United Nations Population Fund will receive any portion of these appropriations , but the size of the increase is itself significant .
wsj_0101	9	In a second area of common concern , the world environment , an additional $ 15 million will be provided in development assistance to fund a series of initiatives , related both to global warming and the plight of the African elephant .
wsj_0101	10	The sweeping nature of the bill draws a variety of special interest amendments , running from an import exemption for a California airplane museum to a small but intriguing struggle among sugar producing nations over the fate of Panama 's quota of exports to the profitable U.S. market .
wsj_0101	11	Panama was stripped of this right because of U.S. differences with the Noriega regime , but the Central American country would have received a quota of 30,537 metric tons over a 21-month period ending Sept. 30 , 1990 .
wsj_0101	12	About a quarter of this share has already been reallocated , according to the industry , but the remaining 23,403 tons are still a lucrative target for growers because the current U.S. price of 18 cents a pound runs as much as a nickel a pound above the world rate .
wsj_0101	13	The potential sales are nearly $ 9.3 million , and House Majority Whip William Gray D. , Pa . began the bidding this year by proposing language that the quota be allocated to English-speaking countries of the Caribbean , such as Jamaica and Barbados .
wsj_0101	14	Rep. Jerry Lewis , a conservative Californian , added a provision of his own intended to assist Bolivia , and the Senate then broadened the list further by including all countries in the U.S. Caribbean Basin initiate as well as the Philippines - backed by the powerful Hawaii Democrat Sen. Daniel Inouye .
wsj_0101	15	Jamaica , wary of upsetting its Caribbean Basin allies , has apparently instructed its lobbyist to abandon the provision initially drafted by Mr. Gray , but the greater question is whether Mr. Inouye , who has strong ties to the sugar industry , is able to insert a claim by the Philippines .
wsj_0101	16	In separate floor action , the House waived budget restrictions and gave quick approval to $ 3.18 billion in supplemental appropriations for law enforcement and anti-drug programs in fiscal 1990 .
wsj_0101	17	The funding is attached to an estimated $ 27.1 billion transportation bill that goes next to the Senate and carries with it a proposed permanent smoking ban on virtually all U.S. domestic airline flights .
wsj_0101	18	The leadership hopes to move the compromise measure promptly to the White House , but in recent days , the Senate has been as likely to bounce bills back to the House .
wsj_0101	19	The most recent example was a nearly $ 17.3 billion fiscal 1990 bill funding the State , Justice and Commerce departments .
wsj_0101	20	And after losing a battle Tuesday night with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , appropriators from both houses are expected to be forced back to conference .
wsj_0103	0	The Labor Department cited USX Corp. for numerous health and safety violations at two Pennsylvania plants , and proposed $ 7.3 million in fines , the largest penalty ever proposed for alleged workplace violations by an employer .
wsj_0103	1	The department 's Occupational Safety and Health Administration proposed fines of $ 6.1 million for alleged violations at the company 's Fairless Hills , Pa. , steel mill ; that was a record for proposed penalties at any single facility .
wsj_0103	2	OSHA cited nearly 1,500 alleged violations of federal electrical , crane-safety , record-keeping and other requirements .
wsj_0103	3	A second citation covering the company 's Clairton , Pa. , coke works involved more than 200 alleged violations of electrical-safety and other requirements , for which OSHA proposed $ 1.2 million in fines .
wsj_0103	4	Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole said , `` The magnitude of these penalties and citations is matched only by the magnitude of the hazards to workers which resulted from corporate indifference to worker safety and health , and severe cutbacks in the maintenance and repair programs needed to remove those hazards . ''
wsj_0103	5	OSHA said there have been three worker fatalities at the two plants in the past two years and 17 deaths since 1972 .
wsj_0103	6	Gerard Scannell , the head of OSHA , said USX managers have known about many of the safety and health deficiencies at the plants for years , `` yet have failed to take necessary action to counteract the hazards . ''
wsj_0103	7	`` Particularly flagrant , '' Mrs. Dole said , `` are the company 's numerous failures to properly record injuries at its Fairless works , in spite of the firm promise it had made in an earlier corporate-wide settlement agreement to correct such discrepancies . ''
wsj_0103	8	That settlement was in April 1987 .
wsj_0103	9	A USX spokesman said the company had n't yet received any documents from OSHA regarding the penalty or fine .
wsj_0103	10	`` Once we do , they will receive very serious evaluation , '' the spokesman said .
wsj_0103	11	`` No consideration is more important than the health and safety of our employees . ''
wsj_0103	12	USX said it has been cooperating with OSHA since the agency began investigating the Clairton and Fairless works .
wsj_0103	13	He said that , if and when safety problems were identified , they were corrected .
wsj_0103	14	The USX citations represented the first sizable enforcement action taken by OSHA under Mr. Scannell .
wsj_0103	15	He has promised stiffer fines , though the size of penalties sought by OSHA have been rising in recent years even before he took office this year .
wsj_0103	16	`` The big problem is that USX management has proved unwilling to devote the necessary resources and manpower to removing hazards and to safeguarding safety and health in the plants , '' said Linda Anku , OSHA regional administrator in Philadelphia .
wsj_0103	17	USX has 15 working days to contest the citations and proposed penalties , before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission .
wsj_0103	18	Before the USX case , OSHA 's largest proposed fine for one employer was $ 4.3 million for alleged safety violations at John Morrell & Co. , a meatpacking subsidiary of United Brands Co. , Cincinnati .
wsj_0103	19	The company is contesting the fine .

wsj_0106	0	ROGERS COMMUNICATIONS Inc. said it plans to raise 175 million to 180 million Canadian dollars US$ 148.9 million to $ 153.3 million through a private placement of perpetual preferred shares .
wsj_0106	1	Perpetual preferred shares are n't retractable by the holders , the company said .
wsj_0106	2	Rogers said the shares will be convertible into Class B shares , but that the company has the option to redeem the shares before a conversion takes place .
wsj_0106	3	A spokesman for the Toronto cable television and telecommunications concern said the coupon rate has n't yet been fixed , but will probably be set at around 8 % .
wsj_0106	4	He declined to discuss other terms of the issue .
wsj_0107	0	The House passed legislation designed to make it easier for the Transportation Department to block airline leveraged buy-outs .
wsj_0107	1	The final vote came after the House rejected Republican efforts to weaken the bill and approved two amendments sought by organized labor .
wsj_0107	2	The Bush administration has threatened to veto such a bill because of what it views as an undesirable intrusion into the affairs of industry , but the 300-113 vote suggests that supporters have the potential to override a veto .
wsj_0107	3	The broader question is where the Senate stands on the issue .
wsj_0107	4	While the Senate Commerce Committee has approved legislation similar to the House bill on airline leveraged buy-outs , the measure has n't yet come to the full floor .
wsj_0107	5	Although the legislation would apply to acquisitions involving any major airline , it is aimed at giving the Transportation Department the chance to review in advance transactions financed by large amounts of debt .
wsj_0107	6	`` The purpose of the bill is to put the brakes on airline acquisitions that would so load a carrier up with debt that it would impede safety or a carrier 's ability to compete , '' Rep. John Paul Hammerschmidt , R. , Ark . said .
wsj_0107	7	The bill , as it was approved by the House Public Works and Transportation Committee , would give the Transportation Department up to 50 days to review any purchase of 15 % or more of the stock in an airline .
wsj_0107	8	The department would be required to block the buy-out if the acquisition is likely to financially weaken a carrier so that safety would be impaired ; its ability to compete would be sharply diminished ; it would be put into foreign control ; or if the transaction would result in the sale of airline-related assets -- unless selling such assets had an overriding public benefit .
wsj_0107	9	The House approved an amendment offered by Rep. Peter DeFazio D. , Ore. that would , in addition to the previous criteria , also require the department to block the acquisition of an airline if the added debt incurred were likely to result in a reduction in the number of the carrier 's employees , or their wages or benefits .
wsj_0107	10	Rep. James Traficant D. , Ohio , said the amendment , which passed 271-147 , would `` let the American worker know that we consider them occasionally . ''
wsj_0107	11	But Rep. Hammerschmidt said that the provision , which he dubbed a `` special interest '' amendment , was likely to make the bill even more controversial .
wsj_0107	12	On Tuesday , the House approved a labor-backed amendment that would require the Transportation Department to reject airline acquisitions if the person seeking to purchase a carrier had run two or more airlines previously that have filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code .
wsj_0107	13	The provision , called the `` two-time-losers '' amendment by its supporters , apparently was aimed at preventing Texas Air Corp. Chairman Frank Lorenzo from attempting to take over another airline .

wsj_0113	0	Despite one of the most devastating droughts on record , net cash income in the Farm Belt rose to a new high of $ 59.9 billion last year .
wsj_0113	1	The previous record was $ 57.7 billion in 1987 , according to the Agriculture Department .
wsj_0113	2	Net cash income -- the amount left in farmers ' pockets after deducting expenses from gross cash income -- increased in 33 states in 1988 , as the drought cut into crop yields and drove up commodity prices , the department 's Economic Research Service reported yesterday .
wsj_0113	3	Most of those states set farm income records .
wsj_0113	4	The worst crop damage occurred in the Midwestern Corn Belt and the northern Great Plains .
wsj_0113	5	What saved many farmers from a bad year was the opportunity to reclaim large quantities of grain and other crops that they had `` mortgaged '' to the government under price-support loan programs .
wsj_0113	6	With prices soaring , they were able to sell the reclaimed commodities at `` considerable profit , '' the agency 's 240-page report said .
wsj_0113	7	In less parched areas , meanwhile , farmers who had little or no loss of production profited greatly from the higher prices .
wsj_0113	8	To the surprise of some analysts , net cash income rose in some of the hardest-hit states , including Indiana , Illinois , Nebraska and the Dakotas .
wsj_0113	9	Analysts attributed the increases partly to the $ 4 billion disaster-assistance package enacted by Congress .
wsj_0113	10	Last year 's record net cash income confirms the farm sector 's rebound from the agricultural depression of the early 1980s .
wsj_0113	11	It also helps explain the reluctance of the major farm lobbies and many lawmakers to make any significant changes in the 1985 farm program next year .
wsj_0113	12	Commodity prices have been rising in recent years , with the farm price index hitting record peaks earlier this year , as the government curtailed production with land-idling programs to reduce price-depressing surpluses .
wsj_0113	13	At the same time , export demand for U.S. wheat , corn and other commodities strengthened , said Keith Collins , a department analyst .
wsj_0113	14	Farmers also benefited from strong livestock prices , as the nation 's cattle inventory dropped close to a 30-year low .
wsj_0113	15	`` All of these forces came together in 1988 to benefit agriculture , '' Mr. Collins said .
wsj_0113	16	California led the nation with $ 6.5 billion in net cash income last year , followed by Texas , $ 3.9 billion ; Iowa , $ 3.4 billion ; Florida , $ 3.1 billion ; and Minnesota , $ 2.7 billion .
wsj_0113	17	Iowa and Minnesota were among the few major farm states to log a decline in net cash income .
wsj_0113	18	Despite federal disaster relief , the drought of 1988 was a severe financial setback for an estimated 10,000 to 15,000 farmers , according to the department .
wsj_0113	19	Many lost their farms .
wsj_0113	20	Department economists do n't expect 1989 to be as good a year as 1988 was .
wsj_0113	21	Indeed , net cash income is likely to fall this year as farm expenses rise and government payments to farmers decline .
wsj_0113	22	At the same time , an increase of land under cultivation after the drought has boosted production of corn , soybeans and other commodities , causing a fall in prices that has been only partly cushioned by heavy grain buying by the Soviets .
wsj_0113	23	Last year , government payments to farmers slipped to less than $ 14.5 billion from a record $ 16.7 billion in 1987 .
wsj_0113	24	Payments are expected to range between $ 9 billion and $ 12 billion this year .
wsj_0115	0	Olympia Broadcasting Corp. said it did n't make a $ 1.64 million semiannual interest payment due yesterday on $ 23.4 million of senior subordinated debentures .
wsj_0115	1	The radio-station owner and programmer said it was trying to obtain additional working capital from its senior secured lenders and other financial institutions .
wsj_0115	2	It said it needs to make the payment by Dec. 1 to avoid a default that could lead to an acceleration of the debt .
wsj_0115	3	In September , the company said it was seeking offers for its five radio stations in order to concentrate on its programming business .
wsj_0116	0	If you 'd really rather have a Buick , do n't leave home without the American Express card .
wsj_0116	1	Or so the slogan might go .
wsj_0116	2	American Express Co. and General Motors Corp. 's beleaguered Buick division are joining forces in a promotion aimed at boosting Buick 's sales while encouraging broader use of the American Express card .
wsj_0116	3	The companies are giving four-day vacations for two to Buick buyers who charge all or part of their down payments on the American Express green card .
wsj_0116	4	They have begun sending letters explaining the program , which began Oct. 18 and will end Dec. 18 , to about five million card holders .
wsj_0116	5	Neither company would disclose the program 's cost .
wsj_0116	6	Buick approached American Express about a joint promotion because its card holders generally have a `` good credit history '' and are `` good at making payments , '' says a spokeswoman for the division .
wsj_0116	7	American Express also represents the upscale image `` we 're trying to project , '' she adds .
wsj_0116	8	Buick has been seeking for the past few years to restore its reputation as `` the doctor 's car '' -- a product for upscale professionals .
wsj_0116	9	Sales were roughly flat in the 1989 model year compared with a year earlier , though industry sales fell .
wsj_0116	10	But since the 1990 model year began Oct. 1 , Buick sales have plunged 33 % .
wsj_0116	11	For American Express , the promotion is part of an effort to broaden the use of its card for retail sales , where the company expects to get much of the future growth in its card business .
wsj_0116	12	Traditionally , the card has been used mainly for travel and entertainment expenses .
wsj_0116	13	Phillip Riese , an American Express executive vice president , says the promotion with Buick is his company 's first with an auto maker , but `` hopefully will be the first of many '' in the company 's effort to promote its green card as `` the total car-care card . ''
wsj_0116	14	To that end , American Express has been signing up gasoline companies , car repair shops , tire companies and car dealers to accept the card .
wsj_0116	15	Many auto dealers now let car buyers charge part or all of their purchase on the American Express card , but few card holders realize this , Mr. Riese says .
wsj_0116	16	Until now , however , buyers who wanted to finance part of a car purchase through General Motors Acceptance Corp. could n't put their down payment on a charge card because of possible conflicts with truth-in-lending and state disclosure laws over finance rates , says a spokesman for the GM finance arm .
wsj_0116	17	But GMAC approved the Buick program , he says , because the American Express green card requires payment in full upon billing , and so does n't carry any finance rates .
wsj_0116	18	Mr. Riese says American Express considers GM and Buick `` very sophisticated direct-mail marketers , '' so `` by joining forces with them we have managed to maximize our direct-mail capability . ''
wsj_0116	19	In addition , Buick is a relatively respected nameplate among American Express card holders , says an American Express spokeswoman .
wsj_0116	20	When the company asked members in a mailing which cars they would like to get information about for possible future purchases , Buick came in fourth among U.S. cars and in the top 10 of all cars , the spokeswoman says .
wsj_0116	21	American Express has more than 24 million card holders in the U.S. , and over half have the green card .
wsj_0116	22	GMAC screened the card-member list for holders more than 30 years old with household incomes over $ 45,000 who had n't `` missed any payments , '' the Buick spokeswoman says .
wsj_0116	23	Some 3.8 million of the five million who will get letters were preapproved for credit with GMAC .
wsj_0116	24	These 3.8 million people also are eligible to get one percentage point off GMAC 's advertised finance rates , which start at 6.9 % for two-year loan contracts .
wsj_0116	25	A spokesman for Visa International 's U.S. subsidiary says his company is using promotions to increase use of its cards , but does n't have plans for a tie-in similar to the American Express-Buick link .
wsj_0116	26	Three divisions at American Express are working with Buick on the promotion : the establishment services division , which is responsible for all merchants and companies that accept the card ; the travel division ; and the merchandise sales division .
wsj_0116	27	The vacation packages include hotel accommodations and , in some cases , tours or tickets to local attractions , but not meals .
wsj_0116	28	Destinations are Chicago ; Honolulu ; Las Vegas , Nev. ; Los Angeles ; Miami Beach , Fla. ; New Orleans ; New York ; Orlando , Fla. ; San Francisco ; and Washington , D.C.
wsj_0116	29	A buyer who chooses to fly to his destination must pay for his own ticket but gets a companion 's ticket free if they fly on United Airlines .
wsj_0116	30	In lieu of the vacation , buyers can choose among several prizes , including a grandfather clock or a stereo videocassette recorder .
wsj_0116	31	Card holders who receive the letter also are eligible for a sweepstakes with Buick cars or a Hawaii vacation as prizes .
wsj_0116	32	If they test-drive a Buick , they get an American Express calculator .
wsj_0116	33	This is n't Buick 's first travel-related promotion .
wsj_0116	34	A few years ago , the company offered two round-trip tickets on Trans World Airlines to buyers of its Riviera luxury car .
wsj_0116	35	The promotion helped Riviera sales exceed the division 's forecast by more than 10 % , Buick said at the time .
wsj_0117	0	The United Kingdom High Court declared illegal a variety of interest-rate swap transactions and options deals between a London borough council and commercial banks .
wsj_0117	1	The ruling could lead to the cancellation of huge bank debts the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham ran up after losing heavily on swap transactions .
wsj_0117	2	As many as 70 U.K. and international banks stand to lose several hundred million pounds should the decision be upheld and set a precedent for other municipalities .
wsj_0117	3	An appeal is expected .
wsj_0117	4	In response to the ruling , gilt futures swiftly plunged more than a point yesterday before recovering much of the loss by the end of the session .
wsj_0117	5	Gilts , or British government bonds , which also fell sharply initially , retraced some of the losses to end about 3/8 point lower .
wsj_0117	6	The council , which is alleged to have engaged in over 600 deals valued at over # 6 billion $ 9.5 billion , lost millions of pounds from soured swap deals .
wsj_0117	7	At one point , Hammersmith is reported to have accounted for as much as 10 % of the sterling market in interest-rate swap dealings .
wsj_0117	8	When two parties engage in an interest-rate swap , they are betting against each other on future rates .
wsj_0117	9	Thus , an institution obligated to make fixed-rate interest payments on debt swaps the payments with another making floating-rate payments .
wsj_0117	10	In most of the British transactions , the municipalities agreed to make floating-rate payments to banks , which would make fixed-rate payments .
wsj_0117	11	As interest rates rose , municipalities owed the banks more than the banks were paying them .
wsj_0117	12	The court hearing began in early October at the request of Anthony Hazell , district auditor for Hammersmith , who argued that local councils are n't vested with constitutional authority to engage in such capital-markets activities .
wsj_0117	13	The council backed the audit commission 's stand that the swap transactions are illegal .
wsj_0117	14	Although the Hammersmith and Fulham council was by far the most active local authority engaging in such capital-markets transactions , the court decision could set a precedent for similar transactions by 77 other local councils .
wsj_0117	15	`` While this court ruling was only on Hammersmith , it will obviously be very persuasive in other cases of a similar nature , '' a solicitor representing one of the banks said .
wsj_0117	16	Already , 10 local councils have refused to honor fees and payments to banks incurred during various swaps dealings .
wsj_0117	17	Other financial institutions involved include Barclays Bank PLC , Midland Bank PLC , Security Pacific Corp. , Chemical Banking Corp. 's Chemical Bank , Citicorp 's Citibank and Mitsubishi Finance International .
wsj_0117	18	If the banks exhaust all avenues of appeal , it is possible that they would seek to have the illegality ruling work both ways , some market sources said .
wsj_0117	19	Banks could seek to recover payments to local authorities in instances where the banks made net payments to councils .
wsj_0117	20	Officials from the various banks involved are expected to meet during the next few days to consider other arrangements with local authorities that could be questionable .
wsj_0117	21	The banks have 28 days to file an appeal against the ruling and are expected to do so shortly .
wsj_0119	0	Some Democrats in Congress are warning that a complicated new funding device for the two federal antitrust agencies could result in further cutbacks in a regulatory area already reduced sharply in recent years .
wsj_0119	1	The funding mechanism , which has received congressional approval and is expected to be signed by President Bush , would affect the antitrust operations of the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission .
wsj_0119	2	As a part of overall efforts to reduce spending , Congress cut by $ 30 million the Bush administration 's request for antitrust enforcement for fiscal 1990 , which began Oct. 1 .
wsj_0119	3	To offset the reduction , Congress approved a $ 20,000 fee that investors and companies will have to pay each time they make required filings to antitrust regulators about mergers , acquisitions and certain other transactions .
wsj_0119	4	Some Democrats , led by Rep. Jack Brooks D. , Texas , unsuccessfully opposed the measure because they fear that the fees may not fully make up for the budget cuts .
wsj_0119	5	But Justice Department and FTC officials said they expect the filing fees to make up for the budget reductions and possibly exceed them .
wsj_0119	6	`` It could operate to augment our budget , '' James Rill , the Justice Department 's antitrust chief , said in an interview .
wsj_0119	7	Under measures approved by both houses of Congress , the administration 's request for $ 47 million for the Antitrust Division would be cut $ 15 million .
wsj_0119	8	The FTC budget request of $ 70 million , about $ 34 million of which would go for antitrust enforcement , would also be cut by $ 15 million .
wsj_0119	9	The administration had requested roughly the same amount for antitrust enforcement for fiscal 1990 as was appropriated in fiscal 1989 .
wsj_0119	10	The offsetting fees would apply to filings made under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act .
wsj_0119	11	Under that law , parties proposing mergers or acquisitions valued at $ 15 million or more must notify FTC and Justice Department antitrust regulators before completing the transactions .
wsj_0119	12	Currently , the government charges nothing for such filings .
wsj_0119	13	Proponents of the funding arrangement predict that , based on recent filing levels of more than 2,000 a year , the fees will yield at least $ 40 million this fiscal year , or $ 10 million more than the budget cuts .
wsj_0119	14	`` When you do that , there is not a cut , but there is in fact a program increase of $ 5 million '' each for the FTC and the Justice Department , Rep. Neal Smith D. , Iowa said during House debate .
wsj_0119	15	But Rep. Don Edwards D. , Calif . responded that a recession could stifle merger activity , reducing the amount of fees collected .
wsj_0119	16	The antitrust staffs of both the FTC and Justice Department were cut more than 40 % in the Reagan administration , and enforcement of major merger cases fell off drastically during that period .
wsj_0119	17	`` Today is not the time to signal that Congress in any way sanctions the dismal state into which antitrust enforcement has fallen , '' Mr. Edwards argued .
wsj_0119	18	Any money in excess of $ 40 million collected from the fees in fiscal 1990 would go to the Treasury at large .
wsj_0119	19	Corporate lawyers said the new fees would n't inhibit many mergers or other transactions .
wsj_0119	20	Though some lawyers reported that prospective acquirers were scrambling to make filings before the fees take effect , government officials said they had n't noticed any surge in filings .
wsj_0122	0	Young 's Market Co. , a wholesaler of spirits , wines and other goods , said it will merge with a new corporation formed by the Underwood family , which controls Young 's .
wsj_0122	1	Under terms of the agreement , shareholders other than the Underwoods will receive $ 3,500 a share at closing , which is expected in December .
wsj_0122	2	The Underwood family said that holders of more than a majority of the stock of the company have approved the transaction by written consent .
wsj_0123	0	Researchers at American Telephone & Telegraph Co. 's Bell Laboratories reported they raised the electrical current-carrying capacity of new superconductor crystals by a factor of 100 , moving the materials closer to commercial use .
wsj_0123	1	The scientists said they created small changes in the crystal-lattice structures of the superconductors to raise the amount of current that single crystals could carry to 600,000 amps per square centimeter in a moderately strong magnetic field .
wsj_0123	2	The scientists said they made the advance with yttrium-containing superconductors cooled to liquid-nitrogen temperature , or minus 321 degrees Fahrenheit .
wsj_0123	3	Their report appears in today 's issue of the journal Nature .
wsj_0123	4	The finding marks a significant step in research on `` bulk '' superconductors , which are aimed at use in wires for motors , magnets , generators and other applications .
wsj_0123	5	Scientists had obtained even higher current-carrying capacity in thin films of the new superconductors , but have had problems increasing the amount of current that bulk crystals could carry .
wsj_0123	6	Superconductors conduct electricity without resistance when cooled .
wsj_0123	7	A family of ceramic superconductors discovered during the past three years promise new technologies such as cheaper electrical generation -- but only if their current-carrying capacity can be raised .
wsj_0123	8	The AT&T advance shows how one aspect of the current-carrying problem can be overcome .
wsj_0123	9	But `` it wo n't lead to imminent use '' of new superconductors , cautioned Robert B. van Dover , one of the AT&T researchers .
wsj_0123	10	He added that the current-carrying capacity of multi-crystal samples of superconductors remains too low for most practical uses because of so-called weak links between crystals .
wsj_0123	11	Such multi-crystal materials will probably be needed for commercial applications .
wsj_0123	12	Mr. van Dover said the AT&T team created the desired crystal changes by bombarding superconductor samples with neutrons , a process that creates some radioactivity in the samples and may not be feasible for large-scale commercial use .
wsj_0123	13	Still , scientists breathed a collective sigh of relief about the finding , because it demonstrates how to overcome the `` flux pinning '' problem that earlier this year was widely publicized as undercutting new superconductors ' potential .
wsj_0123	14	The problem involves the motion of small magnetic fields within superconductor crystals , limiting their current-carrying capacity .
wsj_0123	15	Mr. van Dover said the crystal changes his team introduced apparently pins the magnetic fields in place , preventing them from lowering current-carrying capacity .
wsj_0123	16	Mr. van Dover added that researchers are trying to determine precisely what crystal changes solved the problem .
wsj_0123	17	Determining that may enable them to develop better ways to introduce the needed crystal-lattice patterns .
wsj_0123	18	The AT&T team also is trying to combine their latest superconductor process with `` melt-textured growth , '' a process discovered earlier at Bell Laboratories .
wsj_0123	19	The combined processes may significantly raise the current-carrying capacity of multi-crystal samples .
wsj_0124	0	William C. Walbrecher Jr. , an executive at San Francisco-based 1st Nationwide Bank , was named president and chief executive officer of Citadel Holding Corp. and its principal operating unit , Fidelity Federal Bank .
wsj_0124	1	The appointment takes effect Nov. 13 .
wsj_0124	2	He succeeds James A. Taylor , who stepped down as chairman , president and chief executive in March for health reasons .
wsj_0124	3	Edward L. Kane succeeded Mr. Taylor as chairman .
wsj_0124	4	Separately , Citadel posted a third-quarter net loss of $ 2.3 million , or 68 cents a share , versus net income of $ 5.3 million , or $ 1.61 a share , a year earlier .
wsj_0124	5	The latest results include some unusual write-downs , which had an after-tax impact of $ 4.9 million .
wsj_0124	6	Those included costs associated with the potential Valley Federal Savings and Loan Association acquisition , which was terminated on Sept. 27 , 1989 .
wsj_0124	7	In addition , operating results were hit by an increase in loan and real estate loss reserves .
wsj_0124	8	In American Stock Exchange composite trading , Citadel shares closed yesterday at $ 45.75 , down 25 cents .

wsj_0127	0	Reed International PLC said that net income for the six months ended Oct. 1 slipped 5 % to # 89.7 million $ 141.9 million , or 16 pence a share , from # 94.8 million $ 149.9 million , or 17.3 pence a share .
wsj_0127	1	The British paper , packaging and publishing concern , said profit from continuing lines fell 10 % to # 118 million from # 130.6 million .
wsj_0127	2	While there were no one-time gains or losses in the latest period , there was a one-time gain of # 18 million in the 1988 period .
wsj_0127	3	And while there was no profit this year from discontinued operations , last year they contributed # 34 million , before tax .
wsj_0127	4	Pretax profit fell 3.7 % to # 128 million from # 133 million and was below analysts ' expectations of # 130 million to # 135 million , but shares rose 6 pence to 388 pence in early trading yesterday in London .

wsj_0128	0	Wall Street 's big securities firms face the prospect of having their credit ratings lowered .
wsj_0128	1	The reason : Risks from the firms ' new `` merchant banking '' activities are rising as revenue from the industry 's traditional business erodes .
wsj_0128	2	The downgrading of debt issued by CS First Boston Inc. , parent of First Boston Corp. , by Moody 's Investors Service Inc. , coupled with a Moody 's announcement that Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc. is under review for a possible downgrade , sent shivers through the brokerage community this week .
wsj_0128	3	With the shudders came the realization that some of Wall Street 's biggest players are struggling to maintain the stellar credit standing required to finance their activities profitably .
wsj_0128	4	Securities firms are among the biggest issuers of commercial paper , or short-term corporate IOUs , which they sell to finance their daily operations .
wsj_0128	5	The biggest firms still retain the highest ratings on their commercial paper .
wsj_0128	6	But Moody 's warned that Shearson 's commercial paper rating could be lowered soon , a move that would reduce Shearson 's profit margins on its borrowings and signal trouble ahead for other firms .
wsj_0128	7	Shearson is 62%-owned by American Express Co .
wsj_0128	8	`` Just as the 1980s bull market transformed the U.S. securities business , so too will the more difficult environment of the 1990s , '' says Christopher T. Mahoney , a Moody 's vice president .
wsj_0128	9	`` A sweeping restructuring of the industry is possible . ''
wsj_0128	10	Standard & Poor 's Corp. says First Boston , Shearson and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. , in particular , are likely to have difficulty shoring up their credit standing in months ahead .
wsj_0128	11	What worries credit-rating concerns the most is that Wall Street firms are taking long-term risks with their own capital via leveraged buy-out and junk bond financings .
wsj_0128	12	That 's a departure from their traditional practice of transferring almost all financing risks to investors .
wsj_0128	13	Whereas conventional securities financings are structured to be sold quickly , Wall Street 's new penchant for leveraged buy-outs and junk bonds is resulting in long-term lending commitments that stretch out for months or years .
wsj_0128	14	`` The recent disarray in the junk bond market suggests that brokers may become longer-term creditors than they anticipated and may face long delays '' in getting their money back , says Jeffrey Bowman , a vice president at S&P , which raised a warning flag for the industry in April when it downgraded CS First Boston .
wsj_0128	15	`` Wall Street is facing a Catch-22 situation , '' says Mr. Mahoney of Moody 's .
wsj_0128	16	Merchant banking , where firms commit their own money , `` is getting riskier , and there 's less of it to go around . ''
wsj_0128	17	In addition , he says , the buy-out business is under pressure `` because of the junk bond collapse , '' meaning that returns are likely to decline as the volume of junk-bond financings shrinks .
wsj_0128	18	In a leveraged buy-out , a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely by borrowing , with the expectation that the debt will be paid with funds generated by the acquired company 's operations or sales of its assets .
wsj_0128	19	In a recent report , Moody 's said it `` expects intense competition to occur through the rest of the century in the securities industry , which , combined with overcapacity , will create poor prospects for profitability . ''
wsj_0128	20	It said that the `` temptation for managements to ease this profit pressure by taking greater risks is an additional rating factor . ''
wsj_0128	21	Both Moody 's and S&P cited First Boston 's reliance in recent years on merchant banking , which has been responsible for a significant portion of the closely held firm 's profit .
wsj_0128	22	The recent cash squeeze at Campeau Corp. , First Boston 's most lucrative client of the decade , is proving costly to First Boston because it arranged more than $ 3 billion of high-yield , high-risk junk financings for Campeau units .
wsj_0128	23	In addition , a big loan that First Boston made to Ohio Mattress Co . was n't repaid on time when its $ 450 million junk financing for a buy-out of the bedding company was withdrawn .
wsj_0128	24	`` These two exposures alone represent a very substantial portion of CS First Boston 's equity , '' Moody 's said .
wsj_0128	25	`` Total merchant banking exposures are in excess of the firm 's equity . ''
wsj_0128	26	CS First Boston , however , benefits from the backing of its largest shareholder , Credit Suisse , Switzerland 's third largest bank .
wsj_0128	27	Shearson also has been an aggressive participant in the leveraged buy-out business .
wsj_0128	28	But its earnings became a major disappointment as its traditional retail , or individual investor , business showed no signs of rebounding from the slump that followed the October 1987 stock market crash .
wsj_0128	29	In addition , Shearson 's listed $ 2 billion of capital is overstated , according to the rating concerns , because it includes $ 1.7 billion of goodwill .
wsj_0128	30	Shearson `` really only has $ 300 million of capital , '' says Mr. Bowman of S&P .
wsj_0128	31	A Shearson spokesman said the firm is n't worried .
wsj_0128	32	`` A year ago , Moody 's also had Shearson under review for possible downgrade , '' he said .
wsj_0128	33	`` After two months of talks , our rating was maintained . ''
wsj_0128	34	Drexel , meanwhile , already competes at a disadvantage to its big Wall Street rivals because it has a slightly lower commercial paper rating .
wsj_0128	35	The collapse of junk bond prices and the cancellation of many junk bond financings apparently have taken their toll on closely held Drexel , the leading underwriter in that market .
wsj_0128	36	The firm also has been hit with big financial settlements with the government stemming from its guilty plea to six felonies related to a big insider-trading scandal .
wsj_0128	37	Drexel this year eliminated its retail or individual customer business , cutting the firm 's workforce almost in half to just over 5,000 .
wsj_0128	38	Recently , Drexel circulated a private financial statement among several securities firms showing that its earnings performance has diminished this year from previous years .
wsj_0128	39	The firm 's capital , moreover , has n't grown at the same rate as in the past , officials at these firms say .
wsj_0128	40	Drexel remains confident of its future creditworthiness .
wsj_0128	41	`` We 're well positioned with $ 1.7 billion of capital , '' a Drexel spokesman said .
wsj_0128	42	`` And as a leading investment and merchant banking firm , the fact that we are no longer subject to the uncertainties and vicissitudes of the retail business is a major plus in our view .
wsj_0128	43	Moreover , we 've probably been the most aggressive firm on the Street in reducing costs , which are down around 40 % over the last six months .
wsj_0129	0	Lewis C. Veraldi , the father of the team that created the highly successful Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable cars , retired early after experiencing recent heart problems .
wsj_0129	1	Most recently , Mr. Veraldi , 59 years old , has been vice president of product and manufacturing engineering at Ford Motor Co .
wsj_0129	2	But he is best known in the auto industry as the creator of a team car-development approach that produced the two midsized cars that were instrumental in helping the No. 2 auto maker record profits in recent years and in enabling the company 's Ford division to eclipse General Motors Corp. 's Chevrolet division as the top-selling nameplate in the U.S. .
wsj_0129	3	Under the so-called Team Taurus approach , Mr. Veraldi and other Ford product planners sought the involvement of parts suppliers , assembly-line workers , auto designers and financial staff members from the initial stages of the development cycle .
wsj_0129	4	The concept 's goal was to eliminate bureaucracy and make Ford 's product development more responsive to consumer demands .
wsj_0129	5	It was later applied to other new-car programs , including those that produced the Ford Thunderbird and Mercury Cougar .
wsj_0129	6	Ford Chairman Donald E. Petersen said yesterday that Mr. Veraldi has `` helped to change the world 's perception of American-made cars . ''

wsj_0141	0	Consumer confidence stayed strong in October , despite the unsettling gyrations of the stock market .
wsj_0141	1	`` The sharp stock market decline in late October appears to have had little or no effect on consumers , '' said Fabian Linden , executive director of the Conference Board 's consumer research center .
wsj_0141	2	`` Survey returns received after the drop in the Dow Jones average were about the same as the views expressed prior to that event . ''

wsj_0141	4	The index was 116.9 in October 1988 and in the past year has ranged from a low of 112.9 to a high of 120.7 .

wsj_0145	0	The British Department of Trade and Industry ordered an investigation of the competitive impact of Michelin Tyre PLC 's planned acquisition of National Tyre Service Ltd .
wsj_0145	1	The department said it referred the takeover to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission because of the purchase 's possible effects on the U.K. market for distribution of replacement tires .

wsj_0146	0	Rep. John Dingell , an important sponsor of President Bush 's clean-air bill , plans to unveil a surprise proposal that would break with the White House on a centerpiece issue : acid rain .
wsj_0146	1	The Michigan Democrat 's proposal , which is expected today , is described by government sources and lobbyists as significantly weaker than the Bush administration 's plan to cut utility emissions that lead to acid rain .
wsj_0146	2	The administration 's plan could cost utilities , mainly those that use coal , up to $ 4 billion a year .
wsj_0146	3	The proposal comes as a surprise even to administration officials and temporarily throws into chaos the House 's work on clean-air legislation .
wsj_0146	4	As chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee , Mr. Dingell has almost single-handed control over clean-air legislation .
wsj_0146	5	People close to the utility industry said Mr. Dingell 's proposal appears to guarantee only an estimated seven-million-ton cut in annual sulfur-dioxide emissions that lead to acid rain , though additional cuts could be ordered later .
wsj_0146	6	Mr. Bush 's legislative package promises to cut emissions by 10 million tons -- basically in half -- by the year 2000 .
wsj_0146	7	Although final details were n't available , sources said the Dingell plan would abandon the president 's proposal for a cap on utilities ' sulfur-dioxide emissions .
wsj_0146	8	That proposal had been hailed by environmentalists but despised by utilities because they feared it would limit their growth .
wsj_0146	9	It also would junk an innovative market-based system for trading emissions credits among polluters .
wsj_0146	10	In addition , it is believed to offer a cost-sharing mechanism that would help subsidize the clean-up costs for the dirtiest coal-fired utilities in the country , sparing their customers from exorbitant jumps in their electric bills .
wsj_0146	11	The administration , sticking to its vow of avoiding tax increases , has staunchly opposed cost-sharing .
wsj_0146	12	Mr. Dingell 's staff was expected to present its acid-rain alternative to other committee members , apparently in an attempt to appease Midwestern lawmakers from high-polluting states who insist on cost-sharing .
wsj_0146	13	It is n't clear , however , whether support for the proposal will be broad enough to pose a serious challenge to the White House 's acid-rain plan .
wsj_0146	14	While the new proposal might appeal to the dirtiest utilities , it might not win the support of utilities , many in the West , that already have added expensive cleanup equipment or burn cleaner-burning fuels .
wsj_0146	15	Lawmakers representing some of the cleaner utilities have been quietly working with the White House to devise ways to tinker with the administration bill to address their acid-rain concerns .
wsj_0147	0	American City Business Journals Inc. said its president , Michael K. Russell , will resign rather than relocate to new headquarters in Charlotte , N.C .
wsj_0147	1	Mr. Russell , who co-founded the Kansas City , Mo.-based local business publications concern here , said he would have a five-year consulting agreement with the company , which recently underwent an ownership change .
wsj_0147	2	Earlier this year Shaw Publishing Inc. , Charlotte , acquired 30 % of American City and has an agreement to acquire a further 25 % from E.W. Scripps Co. next year .
wsj_0147	3	Ray Shaw , chairman of American City , said he would assume Mr. Russell 's responsibilities if a successor is n't found this month .
wsj_0149	0	New York financier Saul Steinberg sought federal permission to buy more than 15 % of United Airlines ' parent , UAL Corp. , saying he might seek control of the nation 's second-largest airline .
wsj_0149	1	Although takeover experts said they doubted Mr. Steinberg will make a bid by himself , the application by his Reliance Group Holdings Inc. could signal his interest in helping revive a failed labor-management bid .
wsj_0149	2	Such an application for federal antitrust clearance is necessary for any investor that might seek control .
wsj_0149	3	But some investors have used such filings to boost the value of their stock holdings , which -- without buying more stock -- they then sold .
wsj_0149	4	Takeover stock traders were puzzled by the Reliance filing and cautioned that it does n't mean Mr. Steinberg will definitely seek control .
wsj_0149	5	`` Maybe he just wants to make something happen , '' said one takeover expert .
wsj_0149	6	One investment banker said Mr. Steinberg may be trying to position himself as a friendly investor who could help UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf revive a failed labor-management bid .
wsj_0149	7	Mr. Steinberg , he suggested , could replace British Airways PLC , which has withdrawn from the buy-out group .
wsj_0149	8	Reliance had already bought and sold UAL stock at a big profit without making an antitrust filing before the collapse Oct. 13 of the $ 6.79 billion , $ 300-a-share labor-management buy-out .
wsj_0149	9	Reliance acquired a 7 % UAL stake early this year at an average cost of $ 110 a share , and reduced its stake to 4.7 % after UAL accepted the bid at prices higher than $ 282 a share .
wsj_0149	10	Market sources said Reliance has already sold its entire UAL stake , and thus would n't have any reason to file the application simply to boost the value of its stock .
wsj_0149	11	But the exact amount of Reliance 's current holding has n't been formally disclosed .
wsj_0149	12	The filing adds a new twist to market speculation that Coniston Partners , a New York money manager , has bought more than 5 % of UAL stock and may challenge the UAL board 's decision last week to remain independent .
wsj_0149	13	Speculation about Coniston has caused the stock to rebound from a low of $ 145 .
wsj_0149	14	UAL 's announcement came after the market closed yesterday .
wsj_0149	15	In composite New York Stock Exchange trading , the shares closed at $ 177 , up $ 1.50 .
wsj_0149	16	UAL would n't elaborate on a statement that it had been notified of the filing by Reliance .
wsj_0149	17	Reliance confirmed the filing but would n't elaborate .
wsj_0149	18	Some takeover experts were skeptical , saying it was possible that Mr. Steinberg made the filing only to help boost the value of any remaining Reliance stake in UAL .
wsj_0149	19	Mr. Steinberg is thought to be on friendly terms with UAL 's Mr. Wolf .
wsj_0149	20	The investor was instrumental in tapping Mr. Wolf to run the air cargo unit of Tiger International Inc .
wsj_0149	21	Mr. Wolf 's success in that job helped him land the top job with UAL in December 1987 .
wsj_0149	22	But any potential acquirer must attempt to reach some kind of accord with the company 's employees , primarily its pilots and the powerful machinists ' union , which has opposed a takeover .
wsj_0150	0	A.L. Williams Corp. was merged into Primerica Corp. , New York , after a special meeting of Williams shareholders cleared the transaction , the companies said .
wsj_0150	1	Primerica , which had owned nearly 70 % of Williams , will pay about 16.7 million shares , currently valued at almost $ 472 million , for the rest of Williams .
wsj_0150	2	The financial-services company will pay 0.82 share for each Williams share .
wsj_0150	3	Williams shares , which were to be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange after the close of composite trading yesterday , closed at $ 23.25 , off 12.5 cents .
wsj_0150	4	Primerica closed at $ 28.25 , down 50 cents .
wsj_0150	5	Williams , Duluth , Ga. , is an insurance and financial-services holding company .
wsj_0150	6	Its subsidiaries ' services are marketed by closely held A.L. Williams & Associates .
wsj_0150	7	Primerica , as expected , also acquired certain assets of the agency and assumed certain of its liabilities .
wsj_0150	8	Terms were n't disclosed .
wsj_0151	0	Intelogic Trace Inc. , San Antonio , Texas , said it bought 2.7 million shares , or about 18 % , of its common stock from an unaffiliated shareholder for $ 3.625 a share , or $ 9.9 million .
wsj_0151	1	The move boosts Intelogic Chairman Asher Edelman 's stake to 20 % from 16.2 % and may help prevent Martin Ackerman from making a run at the computer-services concern .
wsj_0151	2	Mr. Ackerman already is seeking to oust Mr. Edelman as chairman of Datapoint Corp. , an Intelogic affiliate .
wsj_0151	3	The action followed by one day an Intelogic announcement that it will retain an investment banker to explore alternatives `` to maximize shareholder value , '' including the possible sale of the company .
wsj_0151	4	In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , Intelogic shares rose 37.5 cents to close at $ 2.75 .
wsj_0151	5	Mr. Edelman declined to specify what prompted the recent moves , saying they are meant only to benefit shareholders when `` the company is on a roll . ''
wsj_0151	6	He added , `` This has nothing to do with Marty Ackerman and it is not designed , particularly , to take the company private . ''
wsj_0151	7	But Mr. Ackerman said the buy-back , and the above-market price paid , prove that Mr. Edelman is running scared .
wsj_0152	0	Dow Jones & Co. said it extended its $ 18-a-share offer for Telerate Inc. common stock until 5 p.m. EST Nov. 9 .
wsj_0152	1	The offer , valued at about $ 576 million for the 33 % of Telerate that Dow Jones does n't already own , had been set to expire Nov. 6 .
wsj_0152	2	Dow Jones , which owns about 64 million of Telerate 's 95 million common shares outstanding , said that about 24,000 shares have been tendered under its offer .
wsj_0152	3	Telerate 's two independent directors have rejected the offer as inadequate .
wsj_0152	4	In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange , Telerate shares closed at $ 19.50 , up 12.5 cents .

wsj_0153	0	Rockwell International Corp. reported flat operating earnings for the fourth quarter ended Sept. 30 .
wsj_0153	1	The aerospace , automotive supply , electronics and printing-press concern also indicated that the first half of fiscal 1990 could be rough .
wsj_0153	2	In an interview , Donald Beall , chairman , said first-half profit certainly would trail the past year 's , primarily because of weakness in the heavy-truck and passenger-car markets .
wsj_0153	3	Still , he added , if the industrial sector remains relatively stable , Rockwell should be able to recover in the second half and about equal fiscal 1989 's operating profit of $ 630.9 million .
wsj_0153	4	For fiscal 1989 's fourth quarter , Rockwell 's net income totaled $ 126.1 million , or 50 cents a share .
wsj_0153	5	That compares with operating earnings of $ 132.9 million , or 49 cents a share , the year earlier .
wsj_0153	6	The prior-year period includes a one-time favorable tax adjustment on the B-1B bomber program and another gain from sale of the industrial sewing-machine business , which made net $ 185.9 million , or 70 cents a share .
wsj_0153	7	Sales rose 4 % to $ 3.28 billion from $ 3.16 billion .
wsj_0153	8	Mr. Beall said that he was generally pleased with the latest numbers and cited a particularly strong showing by the company 's electronics segment .
wsj_0153	9	Overall , pretax electronics earnings soared 12 % to $ 107.9 million from $ 96.4 million .
wsj_0153	10	All four areas had higher revenue for the three months ended Sept. 30 .
wsj_0153	11	For the year , electronics emerged as Rockwell 's largest sector in terms of sales and earnings , muscling out aerospace for the first time .
wsj_0153	12	The graphics business , which also was singled out by the chairman as a positive , saw its operating earnings for the quarter jump 79 % to $ 42.1 million from $ 23.5 million .
wsj_0153	13	For the year , bolstered by the introduction of the Colorliner newspaper-printing press , graphics earnings almost doubled .
wsj_0153	14	Aerospace earnings sagged 37 % for the quarter and 15 % for the year , largely due to lower B-1B program profit ; the last of the bombers rolled out in April 1988 .
wsj_0153	15	That was partially offset by the resumption of space shuttle flights and increased demand for expendable launch-vehicle engines .
wsj_0153	16	The company also took hits in the fourth quarters of 1989 and 1988 on a fixed-price weapons-modernization development program -- probably the C-130 gunship , according to analysts .
wsj_0153	17	For fiscal 1989 , the company posted net of $ 734.9 million , or $ 2.87 a share , down from $ 811.9 million , or $ 3.04 a share , in fiscal 1988 .
wsj_0153	18	Excluding one-time additions to profit in each year , earnings per share were $ 2.47 , up 7.4 % from $ 2.30 in fiscal 1988 .
wsj_0153	19	Sales for the year rose 5 % to $ 12.52 billion from $ 11.95 billion in fiscal 1988 .

wsj_0154	1	The Austin , Texas-based company , which specializes in the direct sale of personal computers and accessories , said its price cuts include a $ 100 reduction on its System 210 computer with 512 kilobytes of memory , a 40-megabyte hard disk and a color monitor .
wsj_0154	2	That package now sells for about $ 2,099 .

wsj_0156	0	The parent of Younkers , after failing to find a buyer for the chain of Midwestern department stores , said it will sell a stake in the chain to management and take other steps to reduce its investment in retailing .
wsj_0156	1	Equitable of Iowa Cos. , Des Moines , had been seeking a buyer for the 36-store Younkers chain since June , when it announced its intention to free up capital to expand its insurance business .
wsj_0156	2	But Equitable said it was unable to find a buyer willing to pay what it considers `` fair value '' for Younkers because of recent turmoil in the bond and stock markets and in retailing .
wsj_0156	3	Younkers rang up sales in 1988 of $ 313 million .
wsj_0156	4	It operates stores mostly in Iowa and Nebraska .
wsj_0156	5	Younkers management is likely to buy a 10 % to 20 % interest in the chain in January , said Fred S. Hubbell , Equitable 's president and chief executive officer .
wsj_0156	6	He said Equitable hopes to eventually reduce its stake in Younkers to less than 50 % .
wsj_0157	0	Tony Lama Co. said that Equus Investment II Limited Partnership has proposed changing the offer for the company to $ 13.65 in cash and stock from an all-cash transaction .
wsj_0157	1	Under terms of the new proposal , Equus , managed by Equus Capital Corp. , Houston , would pay $ 12 cash and one new preferred share with a liquidation preference of $ 1.65 a share for each of Tony Lama 's 2.1 million shares outstanding .

wsj_0162	12	Uncertainty about the prospects for further action to curtail stock-index arbitrage , a form of program trading blamed for recent volatility in the market , also contributed to its lack of direction , Mr. Puccio said .

wsj_0179	0	Junk-bond markdowns , an ongoing Securities and Exchange Commission investigation , a Drexel Burnham Lambert connection , a fizzled buy-out rumor .
wsj_0179	1	All this has cast a pall over Columbia Savings & Loan Association and its high-rolling 43-year-old chairman , Thomas Spiegel , who built the $ 12.7 billion Beverly Hills , Calif. , thrift with high-yield junk bonds .
wsj_0179	2	Bears have targeted Columbia 's stock because of the thrift 's exposure to the shaky junk market .
wsj_0179	3	And some investors fault Mr. Spiegel 's life style ; he earns millions of dollars a year and flies around in Columbia 's jet planes .
wsj_0179	4	Columbia stock recently hit 4 1/8 , after reaching 11 3/4 earlier this year on rumors that Mr. Spiegel would take the thrift private .
wsj_0179	5	Moreover , junk professionals think Columbia 's huge third-quarter markdown of its junk portfolio to $ 4.4 billion was n't enough , meaning another markdown could be coming .
wsj_0179	6	But in recent days , Columbia has edged up , closing at 5 1/4 , up 3/8 , yesterday on revived speculation that the thrift might restructure .
wsj_0179	7	Mr. Spiegel 's fans say Columbia 's Southern California branches are highly salable , and the thrift has $ 458 million of shareholders equity underlying its assets .
wsj_0179	8	That 's almost $ 10 of equity for each Columbia share , including convertible preferred shares , though more junk markdowns would reduce the cushion .
wsj_0179	9	Columbia has only about 10 million common shares in public hands .
wsj_0179	10	The Spiegel family has 25 % of the common and 75 % of the votes .
wsj_0179	11	Other big common holders are Carl Lindner 's American Financial , investor Irwin Jacobs and Pacific Financial Research , though the latter cut its stake this summer .
wsj_0179	12	While many problems would attend a restructuring of Columbia , investors say Mr. Spiegel is mulling such a plan to mitigate Columbia 's junk problems .
wsj_0179	13	Indeed , Columbia executives recently told reporters they were interested in creating a separate unit to hold Columbia 's junk bonds and perhaps do merchant banking .
wsj_0179	14	Columbia wo n't comment on all the speculation .
wsj_0179	15	But like other thrifts , it 's expected to seek regulators ' consent to create a distinct junk-bond entity .
wsj_0179	16	Plans to do this are due to be filed in a week or so .
wsj_0179	17	New rules force thrifts to write down their junk to market value , then sell the bonds over five years .
wsj_0179	18	That 's why Columbia just wrote off $ 130 million of its junk and reserved $ 227 million for future junk losses .
wsj_0179	19	But if Columbia could keep its junk bonds separate from the thrift till they mature -- at full value , unless the issuer goes bust or restructures -- the junk portfolio might do all right .
wsj_0179	20	Columbia , a longtime Drexel client , wo n't provide current data on its junk .
wsj_0179	21	But its 17 big junk holdings at year end showed only a few bonds that have been really battered .
wsj_0179	22	These were Allied Stores , Western Union Telegraph , Gillett Holdings , SCI Television and Texas Air , though many other bonds in Columbia 's portfolio also have lost value .
wsj_0179	23	Possibly offsetting that , Columbia recently estimated it has unrealized gains on publicly traded equity investments of more than $ 70 million .
wsj_0179	24	It also hopes for ultimate gains of as much as $ 300 million on equity investments in buy-outs and restructurings .
wsj_0179	25	One trial balloon Mr. Spiegel is said to have floated to investors : Columbia might be broken up , as Mellon Bank was split into a good bank and a bad bank .
wsj_0179	26	But Columbia 's good bank would be a regulated thrift , while the bad bank would be a private investment company , holding some of Columbia 's junk bonds , real estate and equity investments .
wsj_0179	27	Some think Columbia 's thrift , which now is seeking a new chief operating officer , might be capitalized at , say $ 300 million , and shopped to a commercial bank that wants a California presence .
wsj_0179	28	The thrift surely could be sold for more than the value of its equity , financial industry executives say .
wsj_0179	29	Meanwhile , the bad bank with the junk bonds -- and some capital -- might be spun off to Columbia shareholders , including Mr. Spiegel , who might then have a new career , investors say .
wsj_0179	30	It is n't clear how much a restructuring would help Columbia stockholders .
wsj_0179	31	But `` the concept is workable .
wsj_0179	32	You sell the good bank as an ongoing operation and use some of the proceeds to capitalize the bad bank , '' says thrift specialist Lewis Ranieri of Ranieri Associates in New York .
wsj_0179	33	Mr. Spiegel 's next career move is a subject of speculation on Wall Street .
wsj_0179	34	Few people think Mr. Spiegel wants to run a bread-and-butter thrift , which current rules would force Columbia to become .
wsj_0179	35	`` They are n't really a thrift , '' says Jonathan Gray , a Sanford C. Bernstein analyst .
wsj_0179	36	Of course , regulators would have to approve Columbia 's reorganization .
wsj_0179	37	And some investment bankers say a restructuring is n't feasible while the SEC still is scrutinizing Mr. Spiegel 's past junk-bond trades .

wsj_0181	0	The Bush administration 's nomination of Clarence Thomas to a seat on the federal appeals court here received a blow this week when the American Bar Association gave Mr. Thomas only a `` qualified '' rating , rather than `` well qualified . ''
wsj_0181	1	People familiar with the Senate Judiciary Committee , which will vote on the nomination , said some liberal members of the panel are likely to question the ABA rating in hearings on the matter .
wsj_0181	2	Mr. Thomas , currently chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission , would add another conservative voice to the closely divided court .
wsj_0181	3	Groups have accused him of advocating policies that narrowed rights of older workers and of ignoring discrimination by large companies .
wsj_0181	4	Fourteen members of the House with jurisdiction over the EEOC have said they oppose Mr. Thomas 's nomination because of `` serious questions about his judgment and respect for the law . ''

wsj_0182	4	The move is part of a strategy to focus on its core metals trading , processing and plant engineering activities while shedding peripheral units , the company said .
wsj_0182	5	Lentjes had 1988 sales of 800 million marks $ 434.4 million and has a current order backlog of 2.5 billion marks .

wsj_0186	0	`` Feeding Frenzy '' Henry Holt , 326 pages , $ 19.95 , a highly detailed account of the Wedtech scandal , begins on a reassuring note .
wsj_0186	1	Right up front in the preface , co-author William Sternberg gives us an example of his own integrity .
wsj_0186	2	When offered a free trip from the Bronx , Wedtech 's home , to Washington , D.C. , ) by one of Wedtech 's principals , he tells the reader , `` mindful of accepting anything of value from those I was writing about , I declined . ''
wsj_0186	3	Any question as to why an author would believe this plaintive , high-minded note of assurance is necessary is answered by reading this book about sticky fingers and sweaty scammers .
wsj_0186	4	Bribe by bribe , Mr. Sternberg and his co-author , Matthew C. Harrison Jr. , lead us along the path Wedtech traveled , from its inception as a small manufacturing company to the status of full-fledged defense contractor , entrusted with the task of producing vital equipment for the Army and Navy .
wsj_0186	5	The book revolves around John Mariotta , the founder of the company , and Fred Neuberger , who became his partner soon after Wedtech 's creation .
wsj_0186	6	Although started in 1965 , Wedtech did n't really get rolling until 1975 , when Mr. Neuberger discovered the federal government 's Section 8 A minority business program .
wsj_0186	7	This is a Johnson-era , Great Society creation that mandates certain government contracts be awarded noncompetitively to minority businesses .
wsj_0186	8	Mr. Neuberger realized that , although of Italian ancestry , Mr. Mariotta still could qualify as a minority person since he was born in Puerto Rico .
wsj_0186	9	The two partners merely had to falsify the true ownership of the corporation .
wsj_0186	10	Instead of 50/50 it became , on paper only , two-thirds Mariotta , one-third Neuberger , and they were in the program and off to the races .
wsj_0186	11	Besides being a `` minority-owned company '' Wedtech was located in the South Bronx , a blighted area , made famous by Jimmy Carter in his 1976 presidential campaign .
wsj_0186	12	The company plugged itself right into Carter campaign rhetoric about rebuilding the South Bronx and kept using the minority -- South Bronx angle through the Reagan '80s .
wsj_0186	13	Starting with Congressman Mario Biaggi now serving a jail sentence , the company began a career of bribing federal , state and local public officials and those close to public officials , right up to and including E. Robert Wallach , close friend and adviser to former Attorney General Ed Meese .
wsj_0186	14	Wedtech did n't just use old fashioned bribery .
wsj_0186	15	It made ample use of the modern techniques of influence peddling , retaining politically connected `` respectable '' law firms , investment bankers and political consultants , including Reagan confidant Lyn Nofzinger .
wsj_0186	16	When necessary , it sought and received assistance from organized crime .
wsj_0186	17	Sometimes the bribed became partners in the company .
wsj_0186	18	Wedtech management used the merit system .
wsj_0186	19	If you were especially helpful in a corrupt scheme you received not just cash in a bag , but equity .
wsj_0186	20	If you were not an effective crook , you found yourself out in the cold , a fate that eventually befell Mr. Mariotta , the firm 's semiliterate `` minority '' person .
wsj_0186	21	But despite the sensational nature of the revelations and the breezy , easy-to-read tabloid writing style , `` Feeding Frenzy '' often falls short of gripping reading .
wsj_0186	22	None of the scams show much ingenuity : Auditors found crookery the first day on the job .
wsj_0186	23	Wedtech 's scammers simply bribed them to shut up .
wsj_0186	24	The scammers themselves were garden-variety low lifes , conspicuous consumers who wanted big houses , Mercedes cars , beautiful women , expensive clothes .
wsj_0186	25	Among the lot of them , not one is wrestling with good and evil , or especially intelligent or even temporarily insane .
wsj_0186	26	The one character at least somewhat interesting was Irving Louis Lobsenz , a pediatrician who changed his name to Rusty Kent London and became a master gambler and author of a book on blackjack .
wsj_0186	27	He enters the story toward the end , just in time to get arrested .
wsj_0186	28	Absorbed in doling out `` Feeding Frenzy 's '' tidbits , the authors gloss over the root causes of Wedtech , namely the Section 8 A federal program under whose auspices the scandal took place .
wsj_0186	29	They do at least come around to saying that the courts might want to end `` rigid affirmative action programs . ''
wsj_0186	30	Programs like Section 8 A ) are a little like leaving gold in the street and then expressing surprise when thieves walk by to scoop it up .
wsj_0186	31	Numerous other scandals , among them the ones at HUD , have the same characteristics as Wedtech .
wsj_0186	32	They take place in government programs that seem tailor-made for corruption .
wsj_0186	33	Why are programs like this not eliminated ?
wsj_0186	34	`` Feeding Frenzy '' does provide a few clues .
wsj_0186	35	In and around all levels of government in the U.S. are groups of people who can best be described as belonging to a political insider commercial party .
wsj_0186	36	They know that whenever government is redistributing wealth , regulating commerce or maintaining a large defense establishment , there is big money to be made in influencing , brokering or selling the processes and decisions of government .
wsj_0186	37	They are our version of the East bloc 's Nomenklatura and they have absolutely no wish to see anything change .
wsj_0186	38	How many government programs and policies exist because they line the pockets of political insiders ?
wsj_0186	39	This is the real issue raised by the Wedtech scandal .

wsj_0187	0	The Finnish government and major creditors of bankrupt shipyard Waertsilae Marine Industries Oy agreed in principle to form a new company to complete most of the troubled shipyard 's backlog of 15 ships .

wsj_0187	2	`` The situation is that the bankruptcy court will get out of the shipbuilding business .
wsj_0187	3	Everything will be taken over by the new company , '' said Christian Andersson , executive vice president of Oy Waertsilae , former parent of Waertsilae Marine .
wsj_0187	4	Once its ownership is finalized , the new company will open talks with state-appointed receivers to buy or lease Waertsilae Marine 's shipyard facilities .
wsj_0187	5	Subcontractors will be offered a settlement and a swift transition to new management is expected to avert an exodus of skilled workers from Waertsilae Marine 's two big shipyards , government officials said .
wsj_0187	6	Under an accord signed yesterday , the government and Union Bank of Finland would become major shareholders in the new company , each injecting 100 million Finnish markkaa $ 23.5 million .

wsj_0187	8	Customers holding contracts for Waertsilae Marine 's undelivered ships are expected to subscribe most of the remaining 170 million markkaa in share capital , government officials said .

wsj_0198	0	Two leading constitutional-law experts said President Bush does n't have the legal authority to exercise a line-item veto .
wsj_0198	1	Professors Philip Kurland of the University of Chicago and Laurence Tribe of Harvard Law School said any effort by President Bush to claim authority for a line-item veto would contradict the text of the Constitution and the intent of its authors , as well as the views of previous presidents .
wsj_0198	2	A line-item veto is a procedure that would allow a president to veto part of a big congressional spending bill without having to scuttle the entire measure .
wsj_0198	3	Mr. Bush has said he would like to be able to use this procedure .
wsj_0198	4	A White House spokesman said last week that the president is considering declaring that the Constitution implicitly gives him the authority for a line-item veto to provoke a test case .
wsj_0198	5	But the two legal experts , responding to an inquiry by Sen. Edward Kennedy D. , Mass. , ) wrote in a joint letter that the president `` lacks the constitutional authority to exercise a line-item veto . ''
wsj_0198	6	The two professors represent different ends of the political spectrum -- Mr. Kurland is a conservative and Mr. Tribe is a liberal .
wsj_0198	7	The two professors said the Constitution authorizes the president to veto entire bills , not partial measures .
wsj_0198	8	Moreover , they said the first appropriations bill passed 200 years ago covered many different items , and there was no discussion of a line-item veto .
wsj_0198	9	They also said that more than a dozen presidents have called for line-item veto authority since the Civil War , and `` all have shared the view that such lawmaking power is beyond the reach '' of the president .
wsj_0198	10	Sen. Kennedy said in a separate statement that he supports legislation to give the president line-item veto power , but that it would be a `` reckless course of action '' for President Bush to claim the authority without congressional approval .

wsj_0203	0	Investors are appealing to the Securities and Exchange Commission not to limit their access to information about stock purchases and sales by corporate insiders .
wsj_0203	1	A SEC proposal to ease reporting requirements for some company executives would undermine the usefulness of information on insider trades as a stock-picking tool , individual investors and professional money managers contend .
wsj_0203	2	They make the argument in letters to the agency about rule changes proposed this past summer that , among other things , would exempt many middle-management executives from reporting trades in their own companies ' shares .
wsj_0203	3	The proposed changes also would allow executives to report exercises of options later and less often .
wsj_0203	4	Many of the letters maintain that investor confidence has been so shaken by the 1987 stock market crash -- and the markets already so stacked against the little guy -- that any decrease in information on insider-trading patterns might prompt individuals to get out of stocks altogether .
wsj_0203	5	`` The SEC has historically paid obeisance to the ideal of a level playing field , '' wrote Clyde S. McGregor of Winnetka , Ill. , in one of the 92 letters the agency has received since the changes were proposed Aug. 17 .
wsj_0203	6	`` Apparently the commission did not really believe in this ideal . ''
wsj_0203	7	Currently , the rules force executives , directors and other corporate insiders to report purchases and sales of their companies ' shares within about a month after the transaction .
wsj_0203	8	But about 25 % of the insiders , according to SEC figures , file their reports late .
wsj_0203	9	The changes were proposed in an effort to streamline federal bureaucracy and boost compliance by the executives `` who are really calling the shots , '' said Brian Lane , special counsel at the SEC 's office of disclosure policy , which proposed the changes .
wsj_0203	10	Investors , money managers and corporate officials had until today to comment on the proposals , and the issue has produced more mail than almost any other issue in memory , Mr. Lane said .
wsj_0203	11	The SEC will probably vote on the proposal early next year , he said .
wsj_0203	12	Not all those who wrote oppose the changes .
wsj_0203	13	The Committee on Federal Regulation of Securities for the American Bar Association argues , for example , in its lengthy letter to the SEC , that the proposed changes `` would substantially improve the law ) by conforming it more closely to contemporary business realities . ''
wsj_0203	14	What the investors who oppose the proposed changes object to most is the effect they say the proposal would have on their ability to spot telltale `` clusters '' of trading activity -- buying or selling by more than one officer or director within a short period of time .
wsj_0203	15	According to some estimates , the rule changes would cut insider filings by more than a third .
wsj_0203	16	The SEC 's Mr. Lane vehemently disputed those estimates .
wsj_0203	17	The rules will eliminate filings policy-making divisions , such as sales , marketing , finance and research and development , Mr. Lane said .
wsj_0203	18	The proposed rules also would be tougher on the insiders still required to file reports , he said .
wsj_0203	19	Companies would be compelled to publish in annual proxy statements the names of insiders who fail to file reports on time .
wsj_0203	20	Considered as a whole , Mr. Lane said , the filings required under the proposed rules `` will be at least as effective , if not more so , for investors following transactions . ''
wsj_0203	21	But Robert Gabele , president of Invest/Net , a North Miami , Fla. , company that packages and sells the insider-trading data , said the proposal is worded so vaguely that key officials may fail to file the reports .
wsj_0203	22	Many investors wrote asking the SEC to require insiders to report their purchases and sales immediately , not a month later .
wsj_0203	23	But Mr. Lane said that while the SEC regulates who files , the law tells them when to do so .
wsj_0203	24	Investors who want to change the required timing should write their representatives in Congress , he added .
wsj_0203	25	The SEC would likely be amenable to legislation that required insiders to file transactions on a more timely basis , he said .
wsj_0204	0	The nation 's largest pension fund , which oversees $ 80 billion for college employees , plans to offer two new investment options to its 1.2 million participants .
wsj_0204	1	The Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association-College Retirement Equities Fund said it will introduce a stock and bond fund that will invest in `` socially responsible '' companies , and a bond fund .
wsj_0204	2	Both funds are expected to begin operation around March 1 , subject to Securities and Exchange Commission approval .
wsj_0204	3	For its employees to sign up for the options , a college also must approve the plan .
wsj_0204	4	Some 4,300 institutions are part of the pension fund .
wsj_0204	5	The new options carry out part of an agreement that the pension fund , under pressure to relax its strict participation rules and to provide more investment options , reached with the SEC in December .
wsj_0204	6	The new `` social choice '' fund will shun securities of companies linked to South Africa , nuclear power and in some cases , Northern Ireland .
wsj_0204	7	Also excluded will be investments in companies with `` significant '' business stemming from weapons manufacture , alcoholic beverages or tobacco .
wsj_0204	8	Sixty percent of the fund will be invested in stocks , with the rest going into bonds or short-term investments .
wsj_0204	9	The bond fund will invest in high-grade or medium-grade bonds , mortgages or asset-backed securities , including as much as 15 % in foreign securities .
wsj_0204	10	The fund also might buy and sell futures and options contracts , subject to approval by the New York State Insurance Department .

wsj_0210	0	A bitter conflict with global implications has erupted between Nomura Securities Co. and Industrial Bank of Japan , two of the world 's most powerful financial companies .
wsj_0210	1	The clash is a sign of a new toughness and divisiveness in Japan 's once-cozy financial circles .
wsj_0210	2	Not only are Japan 's financial institutions putting their enormous clout to work ; increasingly they 're squaring off against one another in unprecedented public fashion .
wsj_0210	3	Already , the consequences are being felt by other players in the financial markets -- even governments .
wsj_0210	4	What triggered the latest clash was a skirmish over the timing of a New Zealand government bond issue .
wsj_0210	5	Nomura was attempting to organize the 50 billion-yen $ 352 million borrowing in Japan at a time when many Japanese banks , led by Industrial Bank of Japan , were pressuring the Wellington government to help them recover loans made to a defunct investment bank that had been owned by New Zealand 's civil-service pension fund .
wsj_0210	6	Unwilling to put up new money for New Zealand until those debts are repaid , most banks refused even to play administrative roles in the new financing , forcing an embarrassed Nomura to postpone it this week .
wsj_0210	7	The dispute shows clearly the global power of Japan 's financial titans .
wsj_0210	8	Aside from Nomura 's injured pride , the biggest victim so far has been the New Zealand government .
wsj_0210	9	Barred by its budget law from making any new domestic bond issues , Wellington 's Debt Management Office had been casting abroad to raise the 3 billion New Zealand dollars US$ 1.76 billion to NZ$ 4 billion it needs to come up with by the end of its fiscal year next June 30 .
wsj_0210	10	With Japan 's cash-flush banks aligned against it , though , raising money may be difficult .
wsj_0210	11	Not only can they block Wellington from raising money in Japan , bankers here say , but as the largest underwriters in the Eurobond market , they might be able to scuttle borrowings there , too .
wsj_0210	12	New Zealand 's finance minister , David Caygill , lashed out at such suggestions .
wsj_0210	13	He told reporters in Wellington Tuesday that the government had n't guaranteed the loans to DFC New Zealand Ltd. , an investment bank 80%-owned by the National Provident Fund , and would n't bail it out .
wsj_0210	14	`` It may very well be what the Japanese banks want , '' he told Radio New Zealand .
wsj_0210	15	`` I think it would be irresponsible and I am not about to be blackmailed by Japanese banks or any other international interests . ''
wsj_0210	16	No less significant than the Japanese banks ' attempt to cut off funds to pressure a foreign government are the implications of a confrontation between Japan securities and banking industries .
wsj_0210	17	Anxiety is rising over recent government proposals to eventually lower the strict barriers that now separate -- and protect -- the two industries from each other .
wsj_0210	18	Both sides are jealously guarding their turf , and relations have been at a flashpoint for months .
wsj_0210	19	The banks badly want to break into all aspects of the securities business .
wsj_0210	20	Meanwhile , the securities companies -- most of them smaller than the banks -- are seeking access only to limited kinds of banking that would n't open them to the full brunt of competition from the banks .
wsj_0210	21	Nomura , the world 's biggest securities company largely by virtue of its protected home field , and Industrial Bank of Japan , Japan 's most innovative and aggressive bank in capital markets abroad , captain the opposing sides .
wsj_0210	22	And their suspicions of each other run deep .
wsj_0210	23	In the past year , both have tried to stretch the limits of their businesses .
wsj_0210	24	Nomura started a credit-card venture with American Express Co. that allowed cardholders to use their Nomura securities accounts like a bank account , attracting the wrath of banks .
wsj_0210	25	And Industrial Bank of Japan started up a London securities subsidiary that sells Japanese stocks to non-Japanese institutions overseas , a move that stirred the anger of the stock brokerage firms .
wsj_0210	26	The New Zealand bond issue simply has brought the two institutions face-to-face .

wsj_0239	0	I had to reach back to French 101 when the monsieur avec clipboard leaned over my shoulder during the coffee phase of dinner and asked whether I wanted to ride in a montgolfiere .
wsj_0239	1	I was a last-minute read interloping attendee at a French journalism convention and so far the festivities had been taken up entirely by eating , drinking , smoking , sleeping and drinking .
wsj_0239	2	The man with the clipboard represented a halfhearted attempt to introduce a bit of les sportif into our itinerary .
wsj_0239	3	But as the French embody a Zen-like state of blase when it comes to athletics try finding a Nautilus machine in Paris , my fellow conventioners were having none of it .
wsj_0239	4	The diners at my table simply lit more Gauloises and scoffed at the suggestion of interrupting a perfectly good Saturday morning to go golfing or even montgolfing ballooning to you ; the brothers Montgolfier , French of course , were the world 's first hot-air balloonists .
wsj_0239	5	Back in the U.S.A. this kind of chi-chi airborne activity wins heartwarmingly covetous responses .
wsj_0239	6	As in : `` You went ballooning ? ? ! !
wsj_0239	7	In France ? ? ! ! ''
wsj_0239	8	Americans it seems have followed Malcolm Forbes 's hot-air lead and taken to ballooning in a heady way .
wsj_0239	9	During the past 25 years , the number of balloonists those who have passed a Federal Aviation Authority lighter-than-air test have swelled from a couple hundred to several thousand , with some estimates running as high as 10,000 .
wsj_0239	10	Some 30 balloon shows are held annually in the U.S. , including the world 's largest convocation of ersatz Phineas Foggs -- the nine-day Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta that attracts some 800,000 enthusiasts and more than 500 balloons , some of which are fetchingly shaped to resemble Carmen Miranda , Garfield or a 12-story-high condom .
wsj_0239	11	The condom balloon was denied official entry status this year . )
wsj_0239	12	But in Epinal , a gray 16th-century river town adjacent to France 's Vosges mountain region , none of these Yankee-come-lately enthusiasms for things aloft was evident .
wsj_0239	13	Ballooning at the de rigueur hour of 6 a.m. held all the attraction for most people of sunrise root-canal work .
wsj_0239	14	Feeling the naggings of a culture imperative , I promptly signed up .
wsj_0239	15	The first thing anybody will tell you about ballooning is that it requires zip in the way of athletic prowess , or even a measure of derring-do .
wsj_0239	16	So long as you do n't look down .
wsj_0239	17	They will also tell you that even if you hate heights , you can still balloon .
wsj_0239	18	I still say do n't look down .
wsj_0239	19	At least not when you are ascending . )
wsj_0239	20	What they wo n't tell you is not to go aloft in anything you do n't want to get wet .
wsj_0239	21	I 'm not referring to the traditional champagne drenching during the back-on-terra-firma toast .
wsj_0239	22	I 'm talking about landing in a canal .
wsj_0239	23	In a porous wicker basket .
wsj_0239	24	With a pilot who speaks no English .
wsj_0239	25	To wit , my maiden voyage and novitiates are referred to as virgins began at dawn on a dew-sodden fairway and ended at noon in a soggy field .
wsj_0239	26	Balloon flights almost always occur at dawn or dusk , when the winds are lightest .
wsj_0239	27	In between came lots of coffee drinking while watching the balloons inflate and lots of standing around deciding who would fly in what balloon and in what order the baskets hold no more than four passengers .
wsj_0239	28	When it was n't my turn in the balloon I followed its progress from the `` chase car , '' listening to the driver holler into a walkie-talkie .
wsj_0239	29	After long stretches of this attendant ground activity came 20 or so lovely minutes of drifting above the Vosges watching the silver mists rise off the river and the French cows amble about the fields .
wsj_0239	30	It 's hard not to feel that God 's in his heaven with this kind of bird's-eye view of the world , even if your pilote in silly plaid beret kept pointing out how `` belle '' it all was .
wsj_0239	31	Eventually little French farmers and their little French farmwives came out of their stone houses and put their hands above their tiny eyes and squinted at us .
wsj_0239	32	We were coming down straight into their canal .
wsj_0239	33	See , the other rule of thumb about ballooning is that you ca n't steer .
wsj_0239	34	And neither can your pilot .
wsj_0239	35	You can go only up or down by heating the balloon 's air with a propane burner , which does make the top of your head feel hot and ride the air currents .
wsj_0239	36	Which makes the chase car necessary .
wsj_0239	37	Most balloonists seldom go higher than 2,000 feet and most average a leisurely 5-10 miles an hour .
wsj_0239	38	When the balloon is cruising along at a steady altitude there is little sense of motion .
wsj_0239	39	Only when one is ascending -- or in our case descending a tad trop rapidement -- does one feel , well , airborne in a picnic basket .
wsj_0239	40	`` What 's he doing ? '' hissed my companion , who was the only other English-speaking member of the convention and whose knuckles were white .
wsj_0239	41	`` Attention , '' yelled our pilot as our basket plunged into the canal .
wsj_0239	42	`` You bet attention , '' I yelled back , leaping atop the propane tanks , `` I 'm wearing alligator loafers ! ''
wsj_0239	43	Our pilot simply laughed , fired up the burner and with another blast of flame lifted us , oh , a good 12-inches above the water level .
wsj_0239	44	We scuttled along for a few feet before he plunged us into the drink again .
wsj_0239	45	Eventually we came to rest in a soggy patch of field where we had the exquisite pleasure of scrambling out of the basket into the mud while the French half of our ballooning tag team scrambled in .
wsj_0239	46	I looked at my watch .
wsj_0239	47	Back in the chase car , we drove around some more , got stuck in a ditch , enlisted the aid of a local farmer to get out the trailer hitch and pull us out of the ditch .
wsj_0239	48	We finally rendezvoused with our balloon , which had come to rest on a dirt road amid a clutch of Epinalers who watched us disassemble our craft -- another half-an-hour of non-flight activity -- that included the precision routine of yanking the balloon to the ground , punching all the air out of it , rolling it up and cramming it and the basket into the trailer .
wsj_0239	49	It was the most exercise we 'd had all morning and it was followed by our driving immediately to the nearest watering hole .
wsj_0239	50	This meant returning to the golf course , where we watched a few French duffers maul the first tee while we sat under Cinzano umbrellas , me nursing an espresso and my ego .
wsj_0239	51	A whole morning of ballooning and I had been off the ground barely 30 minutes .
wsj_0239	52	Still , I figured the event 's envy-quotient back in the U.S.A. was near peerless .
wsj_0239	53	As for the ride back to camp , our pilot and all the other French-speaking passengers clambered into the chase car .
wsj_0239	54	My American companion and I were left to ride alfresco in the wicker basket .
wsj_0239	55	As we streaked by a blase gendarme , I could n't resist rearing up on my soggy loafers and saluting .

wsj_0245	0	Coca-Cola Co. , aiming to boost soft-drink volume in Singapore , said it is discussing a joint venture with Fraser & Neave Ltd. , its bottling franchisee in that country .
wsj_0245	1	The venture would be the latest in Coke 's rapid expansion of overseas investment .
wsj_0245	2	So far this year , it has put nearly $ 700 million into bottling operations in Australia , New Zealand and France .
wsj_0245	3	The move also reflects Coke 's eagerness to have a hand in developing the soft-drink markets in Pacific Basin countries .
wsj_0245	4	Aside from Europe , the Pacific division is where Coke will be focusing much of its attention for years to come .
wsj_0245	5	That 's because when Coke looks to the Pacific area , it sees an economic and demographic gold mine .
wsj_0245	6	In countries such as Taiwan , South Korea and Singapore , economies are growing , resulting in a rise in disposable income that consumers can use for soft drinks .
wsj_0245	7	And unlike Europe and the U.S. , where populations are aging , the Pacific Basin countries have growing proportions of youths -- the heaviest consumers of Coca-Cola and other sodas .
wsj_0245	8	A Coca-Cola spokesman said it is too early to say how the joint venture would be structured , or how much the company would invest in the transaction .
wsj_0245	9	In the past , however , Coke has typically taken a minority stake in such ventures .
wsj_0245	10	By acquiring stakes in bottling companies in the U.S. and overseas , Coke has been able to improve bottlers ' efficiency and production , and in some cases , marketing .
wsj_0245	11	Coke has tended to increase its control when results were sluggish in a given country .
wsj_0245	12	That does n't appear to be the case in Singapore , a country of about three million people with a relatively high soft-drink consumption rate -- a key indicator of Coke 's success in a market .
wsj_0245	13	In Singapore , per-capita consumption is about one-third that of the U.S. .
wsj_0245	14	And combining Fraser & Neave 's own soft drinks with Coca-Cola 's gives the Singapore company more than half the share of the soda market there , Coke said .
wsj_0245	15	Fraser & Neave , which also has interests in packaging , beer and dairy products , holds the Coke licenses for Malaysia and Brunei , where per-capita consumption is n't as high as in Singapore .
wsj_0245	16	Coke could be interested in more quickly developing some of the untapped potential in those markets .
wsj_0245	17	A Coke spokesman said he could n't say whether that is the direction of the talks .
wsj_0245	18	Coke said the joint-venture arrangement , which needs approval from both companies ' boards , should be completed early next year .
wsj_0246	0	AMERICAN BRANDS Inc. , Old Greenwich , Conn. , said it increased its quarterly 11 % to 68 cents a share from 61 cents , payable Dec. 1 to stock of record Nov. 10 .
wsj_0246	1	The increase follows the company 's report of strong earnings for the third quarter , and reflects what American Brands called its `` tradition of sharing earnings growth '' with shareholders .
wsj_0246	2	American Brands is a consumer products company with core businesses in tobacco , distilled spirits and life insurance .
wsj_0246	3	As of Sept. 30 , American Brands had 95.2 million shares outstanding .
wsj_0247	0	Giovanni Agnelli & Co. announced a transaction that will strengthen its indirect control of Fiat S.p . A. and will admit Prince Karim Aga Khan as its first non-family shareholder .
wsj_0247	1	Giovanni Agnelli , a limited partnership that is the master holding company for Fiat 's Agnelli family , owns approximately 75 % of the shares in Istituto Finanziario Industriale , which in turn owns approximately 40 % of Fiat , Italy 's biggest private-sector industrial group .
wsj_0247	2	The company said Maria Sole Agnelli Teodorani , sister of Fiat Chairman Giovanni Agnelli , agreed to trade her shares in IFI for new ordinary shares in the limited partnership , which will give her control of 4.67 % of Giovanni Agnelli & Co .
wsj_0247	3	The Aga Khan , meanwhile , agreed to trade some of his stake in Luxembourg-based Ifint S.A. , another Agnelli family company , for 7.45 % of Giovanni Agnelli & Co. 's capital .
wsj_0247	4	His new stake would be in the form of preferred shares , which receive higher dividends but have voting rights only in extraordinary shareholders assemblies .
wsj_0247	5	The Aga Khan owns 10 % of Ifint 's capital , while IFI owns 23 % .
wsj_0247	6	As a result of the transaction , which is expected to be approved at a shareholders meeting Nov. 24 , Giovanni Agnelli & Co. will control 79.18 % of IFI 's ordinary shares .
wsj_0247	7	Its capital will also be raised to 232.4 billion lire $ 172.5 million from the current 204.3 billion lire .
wsj_0247	8	IFI also has nonvoting preferred shares , which are quoted on the Milan stock exchange .
wsj_0247	9	The value of the two transactions was n't disclosed , but an IFI spokesman said no cash would change hands .
wsj_0247	10	The move strengthens the existing links between the Agnellis and the Aga Khan , the head of the world 's Ismaili Moslems who is a longtime family friend and frequently goes sailing with Mr. Agnelli .
wsj_0247	11	Mr. Agnelli and the Aga Khan also have some business ties , and a spokesman for the Agnelli company did n't rule out that the current agreement could lead to further collaboration .
wsj_0247	12	For instance , Ifint earlier this year bought an 18 % stake in Alisarda , the Aga Khan 's airline , which flies between Italy and Sardinia .
wsj_0247	13	Giovanni Agnelli & Co. , which was formed in January 1987 as a way of keeping the Agnellis ' controlling stake in Fiat together despite an ever-growing family tree , has been playing a more active role in the Agnelli group of late .
wsj_0247	14	It raised financing of 300 billion lire for the purchase this summer by another Agnelli-related group of the food concern Galbani S.p . A. , by selling a chunk of its IFI shares to Mediobanca S.p . A.
wsj_0247	15	Mediobanca said during the weekend that it agreed to sell the shares back to Giovanni Agnelli for 333 billion lire .

wsj_0253	0	Armstrong World Industries Inc. agreed in principle to sell its carpet operations to Shaw Industries Inc .
wsj_0253	1	The price was n't disclosed but one analyst estimated that it was $ 150 million .
wsj_0253	2	Armstrong , which has faced a takeover threat from the Belzberg family of Canada since July , said that disposing of the carpet business would improve `` total financial performance . ''
wsj_0253	3	The move also would allow the company to concentrate on core businesses , which include ceramic tile , floor coverings and furniture .
wsj_0253	4	Moreover , such a sale could help Armstrong reassure its investors and deter the Belzbergs , who own a 9.85 % stake in the Lancaster , Pa. , company .
wsj_0253	5	Analysts expect Armstrong to use proceeds of the sale to reduce debt , buy back stock or perhaps finance an acquisition .
wsj_0253	6	The carpet division had 1988 sales of $ 368.3 million , or almost 14 % of Armstrong 's $ 2.68 billion total revenue .
wsj_0253	7	The company has been manufacturing carpet since 1967 .
wsj_0253	8	Recently it upgraded its plants so that it could make stain-resistant products with higher quality dyes .
wsj_0253	9	For the past year or two , the carpet division 's operating profit margins have hovered around 5 % , high by industry standards , but disappointing compared with the 13 % to 19 % margins for two of Armstrong 's chief businesses , flooring and building products .
wsj_0253	10	Analysts hailed the planned transaction as being beneficial to Armstrong and Shaw , the market leader in the U.S. carpet industry , with an estimated 17 % to 20 % share .
wsj_0253	11	Shaw , based in Dalton , Ga. , has annual sales of about $ 1.18 billion , and has economies of scale and lower raw-material costs that are expected to boost the profitability of Armstrong 's brands , sold under the Armstrong and Evans-Black names .
wsj_0253	12	Yesterday , in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange , Shaw 's shares closed ex-dividend at $ 26.125 , up $ 2.25 .
wsj_0253	13	Armstrong 's shares , also listed on the Big Board , closed at $ 39.125 , up 12.5 cents .
wsj_0253	14	Yesterday , Armstrong reported flat earnings for the third quarter and nine months , worsened by the stock dilution of an employee stock ownership plan adopted earlier this year .
wsj_0253	15	For the quarter , earnings were $ 47 million , or 92 cents a share , including a one-time gain of $ 5.9 million .
wsj_0253	16	In the year-ago quarter , earnings were $ 42.9 million , or 93 cents a share .
wsj_0253	17	Yesterday , Armstrong announced an agreement to sell its small Applied Color Systems unit to a subsidiary of the Swiss company , Brauerei Eichof Ltd .

wsj_0254	0	The government 's primary economic-forecasting gauge rose a slight 0.2 % in September , but economists said the report offered little new information on the degree to which the U.S. economy is slowing .
wsj_0254	1	The small increase in the index of leading indicators , which had climbed 0.5 % in August but was unchanged in July , does lend support to the view that the economy has slowed noticeably .
wsj_0254	2	However , it does n't give much of a clue as to whether a recession is on the horizon .
wsj_0254	3	`` I do n't think it provides much new information on the economy , '' said Richard Rippe , economist at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc .
wsj_0254	4	So far this year , the index of leading indicators has risen in four months , fallen in four months and remained unchanged in the other month .
wsj_0254	5	In another report yesterday , the Commerce Department said sales of new single-family houses plunged 14 % in September to an annual rate of 618,000 from 719,000 in August .
wsj_0254	6	The declines were particularly pronounced in the Northeast and in the South , where Hurricane Hugo was a factor .
wsj_0254	7	Although September 's weakness followed two strong months for home sales , the decline supports other indications that the drop in mortgage rates earlier this year has had only a limited beneficial effect on the housing market .
wsj_0254	8	The September drop was the largest since a 19 % drop in January 1982 , but monthly changes in this measure are even less reliable than those in other economic indicators .
wsj_0254	9	Because the figures are based on a small sample , the department said it is 90 % confident only that new-home sales fell somewhere between 5 % and 23 % during the month .
wsj_0254	10	The department also said it takes four months to establish a trend .
wsj_0254	11	So far this year , 534,000 newly built homes have been sold , down 4.5 % from the like months of 1988 .
wsj_0254	12	The index of leading indicators got a major boost in September from a surge in consumer expectations as measured by the University of Michigan .
wsj_0254	13	This measure had dropped sharply in August .
wsj_0254	14	The Commerce Department said that as a result of a new adjustment to the formula used to calculate the index , the influence of this component has been reduced .
wsj_0254	15	Of the 11 components to the index , only three others rose in September : the money supply , the length of the average work week and stock prices .
wsj_0254	16	Several components that track the health of the manufacturing sector of the economy turned down in September .
wsj_0254	17	These include new orders for manufactured consumer goods , lead times on vendor deliveries , orders for new plant and equipment , and backlogs of orders for durable goods .
wsj_0254	18	Meanwhile , the National Association of Manufacturers said yesterday a recent poll of 53 executives on its board found that 61 % do n't expect a recession to occur until 1991 or later .
wsj_0254	19	The remainder expect a downturn to begin sometime in
wsj_0254	20	Although manufacturers often are quick to call for lower interest rates , 60 % of the executives said they would prefer that the Fed keep inflation-fighting as its top priority even if that means higher rates .
wsj_0254	21	The other 40 % said the Fed ought to worry less about inflation and bring interest rates down .
wsj_0254	22	All the figures are adjusted to remove usual seasonal patterns .
wsj_0254	23	Here are the net contributions of the components of the Commerce Department 's index of leading indicators .
wsj_0254	24	After various adjustments , they produced a 0.5 % rise in the index for August and a 0.2 % rise for September .
wsj_0254	25	September , and the change from August , are : from 1.11 in the previous month .
wsj_0255	0	Boston Edison Co. said it will take a previously reported $ 60 million charge against earnings in the fourth quarter .
wsj_0255	1	The charge resulted from a settlement approved yesterday by the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities .
wsj_0255	2	As expected , the settlement limits rate increases for three years and ties future charges to customers for operation of the troubled Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station to that plant 's performance .
wsj_0255	3	In its order , the state regulatory agency said the company `` must be held accountable for the mistakes made in the management of the plant 's operation . ''
wsj_0255	4	Pilgrim had been closed for 32 months .
wsj_0256	0	The average interest rate rose to 8.3875 % at Citicorp 's $ 50 million weekly auction of 91-day commercial paper , or corporate IOUs , from 8.337 % at last week 's sale .
wsj_0256	1	Bids totaling $ 515 million were submitted .
wsj_0256	2	Accepted bids ranged from 8.38 % to 8.395 % .
wsj_0256	3	Citicorp also said that the average rate rose to 8.0087 % at its $ 50 million auction of 182-day commercial paper from 7.962 % at last week 's sale .
wsj_0256	4	Bids totaling $ 475 million were submitted .
wsj_0256	5	Accepted bids ranged from 8 % to 8.019 % .
wsj_0256	6	The bank holding company will auction another $ 50 million in each maturity next Tuesday .
wsj_0258	0	Mips Computer Systems Inc. today will unveil a new general-purpose computer that will compete with more expensive machines from companies such as Sun Microsystems Inc. and Digital Equipment Corp .
wsj_0258	1	The closely held Sunnyvale , Calif. , company also will announce an agreement to supply computers to Control Data Corp. , which will sell Mips machines under its own label .
wsj_0258	2	The new Mips machine , called the RC6280 , will cost $ 150,000 for a basic system .
wsj_0258	3	The computer processes 55 million instructions per second and uses only one central processing chip , unlike many rival machines using several processors .
wsj_0258	4	The machine employs reduced instruction-set computing , or RISC , technology .
wsj_0258	5	At that price , an analyst familiar with the machine said , the computer offers up to 10 times the performance of similar machines .
wsj_0258	6	`` In the price range it 's a tremendously high-performing product , '' said Sandy Gant , an analyst at the market-research firm InfoCorp .
wsj_0258	7	The machine is part of an effort by Mips to establish itself as a supplier of computers , not just of integrated-circuit technology .
wsj_0258	8	Mips also wants to wedge into markets other than traditional RISC applications such as engineering ; Mips said the new machine will also be used by businesses and for communications .
wsj_0258	9	`` This clearly demonstrates that Mips is a systems company rather than just a chip company , '' said Mips Vice President John Hime .
wsj_0258	10	The Control Data deal is a boon for Mips because it gives the the five-year-old company one more ally as it battles more established electronic concerns such as Sun , Hewlett-Packard Co. , Motorola Inc. and Intel Corp. for the emerging market for RISC machines .
wsj_0258	11	RISC technology speeds up a computer by simplifying the internal software .
wsj_0258	12	For Mips , which expects revenue of $ 100 million this year , big-name allies such as Control Data are essential to attract software developers to the company 's RISC architecture .
wsj_0258	13	`` The thing it says about Mips is that they 're on a roll right now , '' said Ms. Gant at InfoCorp .
wsj_0258	14	`` They 're getting some major wins , '' she added .
wsj_0258	15	Last month , for example , Mips agreed to supply its computers to Nixdorf Computer AG of West Germany and France 's Groupe Bull .
wsj_0258	16	Sony Corp. , Tandem Computers Inc. and Digital Equipment have agreed to sell MIPS computers and companies such as Japan 's NEC Corp. and West Germany 's Siemens A.G. have agreed to make Mips chips under license .
wsj_0258	17	Today 's agreement gives Control Data a machine to compete against Digital and other general-purpose computer makers , said John Logan , a computer-market analyst at Aberdeen Group Inc. of Boston .
wsj_0258	18	The machine is essentially a mainframe computer , he said .
wsj_0258	19	`` Suddenly CDC Control Data has a competitive product to fight back against the VAX9000 , '' a machine Digital announced last month , he added .
wsj_0258	20	Control Data , based in Minneapolis , Minn. , expects its sales of Mips systems , including the new RC6280 , to amount to more than $ 100 million by the end of 1991 , Mips said .
wsj_0258	21	Nixdorf , Bull and others will also sell versions of the machine , said Mips President Robert Miller .
wsj_0258	22	Mips will start shipping its new machine in the first quarter of 1990 , he said .
wsj_0258	23	The machine uses a single processor , which makes it easier to program than competing machines using several processors .
wsj_0258	24	The computer can process 13.3 million calculations called floating-point operations every second .
wsj_0258	25	The machine can run software written for other Mips computers , the company said .
wsj_0259	0	Another fight is brewing between Congress and the Bush administration over how to pay for the savings-and-loan bailout without adding to the federal budget deficit .
wsj_0259	1	In a hearing before the House Ways and Means Committee , the General Accounting Office and the Congressional Budget Office , which both are arms of Congress , advised the new S&L bailout agency to abandon plans to raise temporary working capital through debt issued from an agency that would n't be counted on the federal budget .
wsj_0259	2	Officials of the Resolution Trust Corp. have said privately that such a plan was the most likely alternative to raise short-term cash for the bailout .
wsj_0259	3	Instead , the GAO and the Congressional Budget Office said , the RTC should consider using Treasury debt , which is less expensive and subject to oversight by Congress .
wsj_0259	4	The spending could be exempted from meeting deficit-reduction targets in the Gramm-Rudman budget law .
wsj_0259	5	The RTC has projected that it will require between $ 50 billion to $ 100 billion in temporary working capital .
wsj_0259	6	The borrowing to raise these funds would be paid off as assets of sick thrifts are sold .
wsj_0259	7	The new S&L law allows the RTC to issue notes for as much as 85 % of the value of the assets it holds .
wsj_0259	8	But higher interest rates paid on off-budget debt could add billions to the bailout costs , and would n't be subject to congressional scrutiny , Ways and Means members argued .
wsj_0259	9	`` To allow this massive level of unfettered federal borrowing without prior congressional approval would be irresponsible , '' said Rep. Fortney Stark D. , Calif. , who has introduced a bill to limit the RTC 's authority to issue debt .
wsj_0259	10	The RTC will have to sell or merge hundreds of insolvent thrifts over the next three years .
wsj_0259	11	The new S&L bailout law allows $ 50 billion to be spent to sell or merge sick S&Ls and their assets , but that is a net cost .
wsj_0259	12	In the meantime , the agency must raise cash to maintain assets , such as real estate , until they can be sold .
wsj_0259	13	Then the short-term debt is paid off through the proceeds of selling the assets .
wsj_0259	14	David Mullins , assistant secretary of the Treasury , said that the working capital is necessary to reduce the final costs of the bailout , by allowing the agency to sell savings and loans without their bad assets , then hold the assets until they can be sold under favorable conditions .
wsj_0259	15	He said it has n't yet been determined how the RTC will raise the cash , but the administration does n't want it to be included on the federal budget , because it would `` distort '' the budget process by requiring either exemptions from Gramm-Rudman or big increases in the budget deficit .
wsj_0259	16	But the worst possibility would be raising no working capital , he said .
wsj_0259	17	`` If working capital financing is not provided , '' he said , `` the RTC may have to slow S&L sales or dump acquired assets through fire sales .
wsj_0260	0	Panhandle Eastern Corp. said it applied , on behalf of two of its subsidiaries , to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for permission to build a 352-mile , $ 273 million pipeline system from Pittsburg County , Okla. , to Independence , Miss .
wsj_0260	1	The natural gas pipeline concern said the 500 million cubic feet a day capacity pipeline would be built by a proposed joint venture between two Panhandle Eastern units - Texas Eastern Transmission Corp. and Trunkline Gas Co .
wsj_0260	2	Texas Eastern Transmission will build and operate the system , which will connect the Arkoma Basin with several interstate pipelines .
wsj_0261	0	Now was that a quarter cup or a half cup ?
wsj_0261	1	Not a gripping question , unless you 're the pastry chef of this city 's Chez Panisse restaurant and you 've just lost your priceless personal dessert notebook .
wsj_0261	2	Chez Panisse was listed among the top 30 restaurants in the world this year by Connoisseur magazine .
wsj_0261	3	The tattered black binder , bulging with 18 years ' worth of recipes held together by rubber bands , was in chef Lindsey Shere 's purse when it was stolen from her house recently .
wsj_0261	4	The Berkeley police do n't have any leads but doubt the crime was driven by a passion for sweets .
wsj_0261	5	Instead , they figure the culprit probably took money from Ms. Shere 's wallet and discarded all the tips in the five-by-eight-inch looseleaf .
wsj_0261	6	Chez Panisse , whose founder , Alice Waters , is considered the inventor of the cooking style known as California cuisine and whose patrons make reservations a month in advance , has n't exactly subjected diners to vanilla ice cream because of the theft .
wsj_0261	7	For one thing , Ms. Shere can draw on her cookbook , published by Random House four years ago , which is teeming with recipes for such specialties as kiwi sherbet , gooseberry fool a creamy dish made with crushed stewed berries and hazelnut `` oeufs a la neige . ''
wsj_0261	8	For another , sympathetic fans have sent Ms. Shere copies of her recipes clipped from magazines over the years .
wsj_0261	9	Still , the restaurant 's ever-changing menu of five-course dinners -- it supposedly has n't repeated a meal since opening in 1971 -- requires constant improvisation .
wsj_0261	10	And that puts added pressure on Chez Panisse dessert-menu planners .
wsj_0261	11	`` We make what we know how to make , '' says business manager Richard Mazzera .
wsj_0261	12	Many in the Bay Area 's pastry community express disbelief that Ms. Shere kept only one copy of such valuable notes , but she has received moral support from Baker 's Dozen , a group of California pastry chefs that meets regularly to discuss issues like how to keep meringues from weeping and how bovine eating habits affect butter texture .
wsj_0261	13	Ms. Shere has offered a $ 500 reward for the book 's return but figures she 'll have to reinvent many recipes from scratch .
wsj_0261	14	`` It 's an overwhelming job , '' she says .
wsj_0261	15	`` There are so many possible proportions when you consider how many things are made out of eggs and butter and milk .
wsj_0262	0	Newport Electronics Inc. named a new slate of officers , a move that follows replacement of the company 's five incumbent directors last week .
wsj_0262	1	Milton B. Hollander , 60 years old , was named chief executive officer , succeeding Barrett B. Weekes .
wsj_0262	2	Mr. Hollander 's Stamford , Conn.-based High Technology Holding Co. acquired most of its 49.4 % stake in Newport in August .
wsj_0262	3	Mr. Hollander was named chairman last week , succeeding Mr. Weekes , who was among the ousted directors .
wsj_0262	4	The company has declined requests to discuss the changes , but Mr. Weekes has said that Mr. Hollander wanted to have his own team .
wsj_0262	5	Scott Wakeman was named president and chief operating officer of U.S. operations , titles that had been held by Mr. Weekes .
wsj_0262	6	Mr. Wakeman was vice president of the instrument and controls division of closely held Omega Engineering Inc. , another company controlled by Mr. Hollander .
wsj_0262	7	A company spokesman did n't know Mr. Wakeman 's age .
wsj_0262	8	James R. Lees , 51 , vice president of Newport 's European operations , was named executive vice president and chief operating officer of European operations , assuming some former duties of Mr. Weekes .
wsj_0262	9	Arthur B. Crozier , 34 , an attorney , was named secretary , succeeding John Virtue , who was another of the ousted directors .
wsj_0263	0	UNIFIRST Corp. declared a 2-for-1 stock split .
wsj_0263	1	The Wilmington , Mass. , garment service company also boosted its quarterly dividend 20 % to three cents a share adjusted for the split .
wsj_0263	2	The dividend had been five cents a share .
wsj_0263	3	The split and quarterly dividend will be payable Jan. 3 to stock of record Nov. 16 , the company said .
wsj_0263	4	The split will raise the number of shares outstanding to about 10.2 million .
wsj_0263	5	Separately , UniFirst reported that net income rose 21 % to $ 3 million , or 29 cents a share adjusted for the split , for the fourth quarter ended Aug. 26 .
wsj_0263	6	A year earlier UniFirst earned $ 2.4 million , or 24 cents a share adjusted for the split .
wsj_0263	7	Sales rose to $ 52.4 million from $ 50.1 million .
wsj_0264	0	Fibreboard Corp. said it completed the previously reported sale of approximately 27,500 acres of timberland near Truckee , Calif. , to closely held Sierra Pacific Industries Corp. , Arcata , Calif. , for $ 32.5 million .
wsj_0264	1	The lumber , insulation and fireproofing concern said the transaction , which includes a swap of other timber interests , would result in a $ 13.5 million after-tax gain , to be recorded in the fourth quarter .
wsj_0265	0	Healthcare International Inc. said it reached a 120-day standstill agreement with its HealthVest affiliate calling for Healthcare to pay HealthVest $ 5 million right away and additional amounts in the future .
wsj_0265	1	Under the agreement , Healthcare , a manager of health-care facilities , said it would pay HealthVest $ 3.9 million in overdue rent and mortgage payments and repay $ 1.1 million in funds that HealthVest advanced for construction work on facilities .
wsj_0265	2	In return , HealthVest agreed that it wo n't exercise its rights and remedies against Healthcare during the 120-day period .
wsj_0265	3	After the payment , Healthcare still will be $ 6.5 million in arrears on rent and mortgage payments to HealthVest , a real estate investment trust whose portfolio consists largely of properties operated by Healthcare .
wsj_0265	4	Healthcare has given HealthVest a 12 % note for that overdue amount , to be repaid over three years .
wsj_0265	5	In addition , Healthcare agreed to make monthly rent and mortgage payments of $ 2.7 million to $ 3 million to HealthVest during the standstill period , to be paid when Healthcare successfully completes asset sales .
wsj_0265	6	Because Healthcare actually owes HealthVest $ 4.2 million in rent and mortgage payments each month , the amount due above the amount paid will be added to the three-year note .
wsj_0265	7	The funds should help ease a cash bind at HealthVest , which has been unable to pay its debts because Healthcare has n't made complete rent and mortgage payments since July .
wsj_0265	8	A spokesman said HealthVest has paid two of the three banks it owed interest to in October and is in negotiations with the third bank .
wsj_0265	9	Healthcare , which has been in a severe liquidity bind , said it is able to make the payments because it completed a transaction with Greenery Rehabilitation Group Inc. in which Greenery purchased stock and warrants for $ 500,000 and loaned Healthcare $ 9 million .
wsj_0265	10	The loan is backed by Healthcare 's 5.4 % stake in HealthVest and interest in certain facilities .
wsj_0266	0	I was pleased to note that your Oct. 23 Centennial Journal item recognized the money-fund concept as one of the significant events of the past century .
wsj_0266	1	Actually , about two years ago , the Journal listed the creation of the money fund as one of the 10 most significant events in the world of finance in the 20th century .
wsj_0266	2	But the Reserve Fund , America 's first money fund , was not named , nor were the creators of the money-fund concept , Harry Brown and myself .
wsj_0266	3	We innovated telephone redemptions , daily dividends , total elimination of share certificates and the constant $ 1 pershare pricing , all of which were painfully thought out and not the result of some inadvertence on the part of the SEC .
wsj_0268	0	Many thanks for Alexander Cockburn 's comic masterpiece `` U.S. . Economy : A House Built on Junk-Bond Sand , '' Viewpoint , Oct. 19 .
wsj_0268	1	The use of the abominable construction practices in the Soviet Union -- as evidenced by the collapse of sand apartment blocks during the Armenian earthquake -- as a metaphor for the U.S. economic system was a sublime example of Mr. Cockburn 's satirical muse .
wsj_0268	2	I await his sequel : the economic and social resiliency of the San Francisco Bay area and the outstanding work of the local governments and the private charitable organizations there as metaphors for the supremacy of whatever failed system Mr. Cockburn now believes in .
wsj_0268	3	It should be a scream .
wsj_0269	0	As a money manager and a grass-roots environmentalist , I was very disappointed to read in the premiere issue of Garbage that The Wall Street Journal uses 220,000 metric tons of newsprint each year , but that only 1.4 % of it comes from recycled paper .
wsj_0269	1	By contrast , the Los Angeles Times , for example , uses 83 % recycled paper .
wsj_0269	2	With newspapers being the largest single component of solid waste in our landfills , and with our country overflowing with trash , all sectors of our society and all types of businesses must become more responsible in our use and disposal of precious natural resources .
wsj_0269	3	The Wall Street Journal is an excellent publication that I enjoy reading and must read daily .
wsj_0269	4	Please make me and thousands of other readers more comfortable with our daily purchase of your newspaper by raising your environmental standards to your overall impeccable quality levels , and increase your use of recycled paper .

wsj_0272	0	EG&G Inc. said it acquired Laboratorium Prof. Dr. Berthold , a German maker of scientific instruments .
wsj_0272	1	Terms were n't disclosed .
wsj_0272	2	The Wellesley , Mass. , maker of scientific instruments and electronic parts said Berthold expects 1989 sales of more than 100 million Deutsche marks $ 54.5 million and employs about 400 people .
wsj_0272	3	Berthold is based in Wildbad , West Germany , and also has operations in Belgium .
wsj_0272	4	John M. Kucharski , EG&G 's chairman and chief executive , said the acquisition `` will extend EG&G 's core technologies , strengthen its position in the European Economic Community and assure a strength and presence in the Eastern European market . ''
wsj_0272	5	He said it especially will strengthen the company 's efforts in the rapidly growing field of bio-analytical instrumentation , and in applied nuclear physics .
wsj_0272	6	Separately , EG&G said it sold most of its Mason Research Institute subsidiary to Transgenic Sciences Inc. , a closely held biotechnology company based in Worcester , Mass .
wsj_0272	7	The sale , for $ 7 million in cash and securities , will leave EG&G with a 12 % stake in Transgenic , executives said .

wsj_0273	0	The Internal Revenue Service said it is willing to let the U.S. Tax Court decide how much oil man William Herbert Hunt will owe the government after his assets are liquidated .
wsj_0273	1	The surprise announcement came after the IRS broke off negotiations with Mr. Hunt on a settlement of the one-time tycoon 's personal bankruptcy case .
wsj_0273	2	Although the action removes one obstacle in the way of an overall settlement to the case , it also means that Mr. Hunt could be stripped of virtually all of his assets if the Tax Court rules against him in a 1982 case heard earlier this year in Washington , D.C .
wsj_0273	3	The IRS has been seeking more than $ 300 million in back taxes from Mr. Hunt .
wsj_0273	4	Separately , a federal judge hearing Mr. Hunt 's bankruptcy case yesterday turned down a proposed $ 65.7 million settlement between Mr. Hunt and Minpeco S.A. , another major creditor in the case .
wsj_0273	5	The Peruvian minerals concern had been seeking a claim of $ 251 million against Mr. Hunt .
wsj_0273	6	In addition to turning down the compromise , Judge Harold C. Abramson said he would allow a claim of only $ 19.7 million .
wsj_0273	7	Minpeco attorneys said they would appeal the decision to a federal district court .
wsj_0273	8	Regarding Mr. Hunt 's taxes , he and the IRS have apparently agreed on a basic formula for liquidating his estate in which the IRS would get 70 % of the proceeds from a liquidating trust and 30 % would go to other creditors .
wsj_0273	9	But they have been at odds over how much Mr. Hunt would owe the government after his assets are sold .
wsj_0273	10	The IRS had demanded $ 90 million but Mr. Hunt would agree to no more than $ 60 million .
wsj_0273	11	Grover Hartt III , a government lawyer , warned that Mr. Hunt stood to lose certain oil and gas properties , $ 200,000 in English pottery , a Colorado condominium and other assets he might have kept if he had settled with the IRS .
wsj_0273	12	`` But they wanted to roll the dice and we 're going to let them , '' Mr. Hartt said .
wsj_0273	13	Stephen McCartin , Mr. Hunt 's attorney , said his client welcomed the gamble .
wsj_0273	14	The Tax Court is n't expected to rule before early next year .
wsj_0276	0	Michael Blair , former president and chief executive officer of Enfield Corp. , failed to win election to the company 's board at a special shareholder meeting .
wsj_0276	1	Mr. Blair said after the meeting that he had filed separate lawsuits in the Ontario Supreme Court for unjust dismissal against Enfield and for libel against its largest shareholder , Canadian Express Ltd. , and two executives of Hees International Bancorp Inc. , which controls Canadian Express .
wsj_0276	2	Holders at the meeting elected a full slate of Canadian Express nominees to Enfield 's 11-member board .
wsj_0276	3	Mr. Blair and Hees have been feuding for months .
wsj_0276	4	Yesterday 's election was a sequel to Enfield 's annual meeting in June when Mr. Blair disallowed proxies in favor of two Hees nominees .
wsj_0276	5	The Ontario Supreme Court overturned Mr. Blair 's decision .
wsj_0276	6	He later resigned from his executive positions with Enfield , saying that actions by its board `` amounted to my dismissal . ''
wsj_0276	7	Mr. Blair said his libel suit seeks 10 million Canadian dollars US$ 8.5 million from Canadian Express and Hees executives Manfred Walt and Willard L'Heureux .
wsj_0276	8	He said his suit against Enfield seeks two years severance pay , equivalent to C$ 720,000 .
wsj_0276	9	Hees and Canadian Express executives could n't be reached for comment .
wsj_0276	10	Enfield is a holding company with interests in manufacturing concerns .
wsj_0276	11	It is 38.5 % owned by Canadian Express , another holding company .
wsj_0276	12	Hees is a merchant bank controlled by Toronto financiers Peter and Edward Bronfman .
wsj_0276	13	All the concerns are based in Toronto .
wsj_0278	0	Time Warner Inc. and Sony Corp. may be today 's public enemies , but the two entertainment giants could end up becoming partners in a number of ventures as part of a settlement of their acrimonious legal dispute over Hollywood producers Peter Guber and Jon Peters .
wsj_0278	1	The Warner Bros. studio and Sony signaled they are close to a settlement yesterday , asking a Los Angeles Superior Court to postpone a hearing scheduled for tomorrow on Warner 's request for a preliminary injunction blocking Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters from taking the top posts at Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc .
wsj_0278	2	In separate statements , the two sides said they want to have `` further discussions . ''
wsj_0278	3	Sony is acquiring Columbia and Guber-Peters Entertainment Co. in two separate transactions valued at more than $ 5 billion .
wsj_0278	4	Warner Communications Inc. , which is being acquired by Time Warner , has filed a $ 1 billion breach-of-contract suit against Sony and the two producers .
wsj_0278	5	Warner has a five-year exclusive contract with Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters that requires them to make movies exclusively at the Warner Bros. studio .
wsj_0278	6	The two sides in the legal battle have hurled accusations of duplicity at each other for weeks , and both Warner and Sony have accused each other of trying to sabotage each other 's prospects for success in the entertainment business .
wsj_0278	7	But it may amount to little more than posturing ; the two have continued on-again , off-again settlement talks over the last few weeks , and people familiar with the talks say the matter could be resolved within a week .
wsj_0278	8	Both Warner and Sony declined to comment on the terms of the settlement discussions .
wsj_0278	9	But the people familiar with the talks said that Warner is n't expected to get any cash in the settlement .
wsj_0278	10	Instead , Sony is likely to agree to let Warner participate in certain of its businesses , such as the record club of Sony 's CBS Records unit .
wsj_0278	11	Warner has surpassed Sony as the largest record company , but it does n't have a powerful world-wide record club like CBS .
wsj_0278	12	The two sides are also discussing certain business ventures involving cable rights to Columbia 's movies .
wsj_0278	13	In addition , Sony is expected to agree to swap Columbia 's 35 % stake in the sprawling Burbank , Calif. , studio that Warner and Columbia share , in exchange for the old MGM studio lot that Warner acquired with the purchase of Lorimar Telepictures Corp .
wsj_0278	14	Still , it may be tough for the two to have a smooth partnership in anything , in the wake of sworn affidavits filed over the last week .
wsj_0278	15	One , for example , came from CBS Records Chairman Walter Yetnikoff , who will head a committee that will oversee Sony 's entertainment division , including both records and movies .
wsj_0278	16	In his affidavit , Mr. Yetnikoff accused Warner Chairman Steven J. Ross of having an `` antiSony , anti-Japanese bias '' and said that Mr. Ross had tried to talk him out of letting Sony buy CBS Records two years ago for that reason .
wsj_0278	17	Mr. Ross , who will be chairman and co-chief executive officer of Time Warner after the merger is complete , denied that in his own affidavit , and called Mr. Yetnikoff 's remarks `` vicious '' and his claims `` reckless , irresponsible and baseless , '' saying Warner under his leadership has started a number of businesses in Japan .
wsj_0278	18	Mr. Ross also said he enjoys `` warm professional and personal relationships '' with Japanese executives including Sony Chairman Akio Morita , `` who has visited my home here . ''
wsj_0278	19	But despite the acrimony between Mr. Ross and Mr. Yetnikoff , officials of the Time side of Time Warner have reportedly been increasingly interested in a settlement that might yield attractive business opportunities .
wsj_0278	20	Time executives such as the company 's president , N.J . Nicholas , who will eventually be co-chief executive of Time Warner alongside Mr. Ross , have no personal relationships or ego at stake in the fight over the Guber-Peters duo , and were never directly drawn into the fray .
wsj_0278	21	Talks between the two sides could unravel , of course , as they have more than once since Sony announced its plans to hire Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters .
wsj_0278	22	But both sides appear to be more willing now to meet each other 's terms to resolve the issue .
wsj_0278	23	And although Warner has said it wanted the producers to fulfill the terms of their contract , the producers said in sworn court declarations that they did n't believe the relationship could be repaired after the acrimony of the legal battle .
wsj_0278	24	Any settlement is also expected to exclude Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters from any of the projects they were working on at Warner .
wsj_0278	25	The Guber-Peters duo have 50 projects in various stages of development and production at Warner , including `` Bonfire of the Vanities '' and `` A Bright Shining Lie . ''
wsj_0278	26	But that does n't mean Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters might not eventually get their hands on some of their projects ; studios develop hundreds of movies but produce only 10 to 20 each year .
wsj_0278	27	Once a studio chooses not to actually make a movie that is in development , producers are typically free to take it elsewhere .
wsj_0278	28	Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters also almost certainly would n't be able to participate in future sequels to `` Batman , '' the blockbuster hit they produced for Warner .
wsj_0278	29	But in acquiring Guber-Peters Entertainment , Sony will actually get a piece of the profits from `` Batman , '' since the publicly held concern gets certain revenue from the movies Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters produce .
wsj_0278	30	The two producers own a combined 28 % stake in Guber-Peters .
wsj_0279	0	Southern Co. 's Gulf Power Co. subsidiary pleaded guilty to two felony charges of conspiracy to make illegal political contributions and tax evasion , and paid $ 500,000 in fines .
wsj_0279	1	Gulf Power 's guilty plea before U.S. District Judge Robert L. Vining yesterday marks the end of only one part of a wide-ranging inquiry of Southern Co .
wsj_0279	2	The company is the subject of a federal grand jury investigation into whether its officials and its utility subsidiaries conspired to cover up their accounting for spare parts to evade federal income taxes .
wsj_0279	3	`` The terms announced today are strictly between the United States and Gulf Power , '' said U.S. Attorney Robert L. Barr .
wsj_0279	4	`` This is only a further step in a lengthy investigation . ''
wsj_0279	5	The plea settlement does not allow Southern Co. to charge any of the $ 500,000 to its customers , or take action against employees who provided information during the federal inquiry .
wsj_0279	6	Gulf Power had been under investigation for violating the Utility Holding Company Act , which prohibits public utilities from making political contributions .
wsj_0279	7	In a statement , Southern Co. President Edward L. Addison said , `` We believe our decision to plead guilty to these charges is responsible and proper .
wsj_0279	8	And our action today will allow Gulf Power to avoid prolonged , distracting legal proceedings . ''
wsj_0279	9	He did not say what effect , if any , the $ 500,000 fine would have on the company 's earnings .
wsj_0279	10	Mr. Barr said yesterday 's plea by Gulf Power , which came after months of negotiations , was based on evidence that Gulf Power had set up an elaborate payment system through which it reimbursed outside vendors -- primarily three Florida advertising agencies -- for making illegal political contributions on its behalf .
wsj_0279	11	The Appleyard Agency , for example , allegedly made contributions from 1982 to 1984 to various funds for political candidates , then submitted bills to Gulf Power .
wsj_0279	12	The contributions were funded by monthly payments of $ 1,000 to $ 2,000 to Appleyard in the guise of a `` special production fee '' -- in effect , hiding the nature of the payments from the Internal Revenue Service , federal prosecutors said .
wsj_0279	13	The government also indicated that former Gulf Power senior vice president Jacob F. `` Jake '' Horton was the mastermind behind the use of the ad agencies -- Appleyard , Dick Leonard Group II Inc. and Hemmer & Yates Corp. -- to make payments to various political candidates from 1981 to 1988 .
wsj_0279	14	Mr. Horton , who oversaw Gulf Power 's governmental-affairs efforts , died mysteriously in a plane crash in April after learning he might be fired following the uncovering of irregularities in a company audit .
wsj_0279	15	Government officials declined to say whether the investigation includes the ad agencies or the politicians involved .
wsj_0279	16	In New York Stock Exchange trading , Southern Co. rose 50 cents a share to $ 27.125 .
wsj_0281	0	Northwest Airlines settled the remaining lawsuits filed on behalf of 156 people killed in a 1987 crash , but claims against the jetliner 's maker are being pursued , a federal judge said .
wsj_0281	1	Northwest , a unit of NWA Inc. , and McDonnell Douglas Corp. , which made the MD-80 aircraft , also are pursuing counterclaims against each other in the crash near Detroit Metropolitan Airport .
wsj_0281	2	Terms of the settlements for the remaining 145 lawsuits against Northwest were n't disclosed .
wsj_0281	3	A total of 157 lawsuits were filed on behalf of crash victims .
wsj_0281	4	U.S. District Judge Julian A. Cook Jr. announced the settlements as the jury trial was to begin yesterday .
wsj_0281	5	He reset opening arguments for today .
wsj_0281	6	The jury will resolve the claims against McDonnell Douglas , Northwest 's claim that a defect in the aircraft caused the crash , and McDonnell Douglas ' claim that the plane was improperly flown .
wsj_0281	7	The National Transportation Safety Board ruled that pilots failed to set the plane 's wing flaps and slats properly for takeoff and failed to make mandatory preflight checks that would have detected the error .
wsj_0281	8	Also , a cockpit warning system failed to alert the pilots the flaps and slats were not set for takeoff , the NTSB said .
wsj_0281	9	The only passenger who survived the crash was Cecelia Cichan , then 4 , of Tempe , Ariz. , whose parents and brother died in the crash .
wsj_0281	10	She now lives with relatives in Alabama .
wsj_0283	0	The Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trust said it is considering several ways to ease a liquidity crunch that could include the sale of Manville Corp. to a third party .
wsj_0283	1	In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission , the majority holder of Manville acknowledged that the cash portion of its initial funding of $ 765 million will be depleted next year , and that alternative sources of funds will be necessary to meet its obligations .
wsj_0283	2	The trust , which was created as part of Manville 's bankruptcy-law reorganization to compensate victims of asbestos-related diseases , ultimately expects to receive $ 2.5 billion from Manville , but its cash flow from investments has so far lagged behind its payments to victims .
wsj_0283	3	Spokespersons for both the trust and the company refused to comment on whether any talks with a possible acquirer of Manville had actually taken place .
wsj_0283	4	The trust is considering a sale of its Manville holdings , but Manville has the right of first refusal on any sales of its stock held by the trust .
wsj_0283	5	Manville , a forest and building products concern , has offered to pay the trust $ 500 million for a majority of Manville 's convertible preferred stock .
wsj_0283	6	Manville and the trust are discussing the offer , but no decision has been made .
wsj_0283	7	The filing also said the trust is considering a sale of Manville securities in the open market ; an extraordinary dividend on the common stock ; or a recapitalization of Manville .
wsj_0283	8	The Soviet Union 's jobless rate is soaring to 27 % in some areas , Pravda said .
wsj_0283	9	It said the situation is caused by efforts to streamline bloated factory payrolls .
wsj_0283	10	Unemployment has reached 27.6 % in Azerbaijan , 25.7 % in Tadzhikistan , 22.8 % in Uzbekistan , 18.8 % in Turkmenia , 18 % in Armenia and 16.3 % in Kirgizia , the Communist Party newspaper said .
wsj_0283	11	All are non-Russian republics along the southern border of the Soviet Union , and all but Kirgizia have reported rioting in the past six months .
wsj_0283	12	The newspaper said it is past time for the Soviet Union to create unemployment insurance and retraining programs like those of the West .
wsj_0283	13	Pravda gave no estimate for overall unemployment but said an `` Association of the Unemployed '' has cropped up that says the number of jobless is 23 million Soviets , or 17 % of the work force .
wsj_0283	14	An 11-week dispute involving Australia 's 1,640 domestic pilots has slashed airline earnings and crippled much of the continent 's tourist industry .
wsj_0283	15	`` The only people who are flying are those who have to , '' said Frank Moore , chairman of the Australian Tourist Industry Association .
wsj_0283	16	He added : `` How is a travel agent going to sell a holiday when he can not guarantee a return flight ? ''
wsj_0283	17	Transport giant TNT , which owns half of one of the country 's two major domestic carriers , said the cost of the dispute had been heavy , cutting TNT 's profits 70 % to $ 12 million in the three months to Sept. 30 .
wsj_0283	18	Brazilian financier Naji Nahas , who was arrested on Monday after 102 days in hiding , is likely to be interrogated next week by the Brazilian judiciary .
wsj_0283	19	Mr. Nahas , who single-handedly provoked a one-day closure of Brazil 's stock markets in June when he failed to honor a debt of $ 31.1 million owed to his brokers , yesterday blamed his predicament on the president of the Sao Paulo stock exchange ; a few days before Mr. Nahas 's failure , the exchange raised the required margin on stock-margin transactions .
wsj_0283	20	China 's parliament ousted two Hong Kong residents from a panel drafting a new constitution for the colony .
wsj_0283	21	The two , Szeto Wah and Martin Lee , were deemed unfit because they had condemned China 's crackdown on its pro-democracy movement .
wsj_0283	22	The committee is formulating Hong Kong 's constitution for when it reverts to Chinese control in 1997 , and Chinese lawmakers said the two can only return if they `` abandon their antagonistic stand against the Chinese government and their attempt to nullify the Sino-British joint declaration on Hong Kong . ''
wsj_0283	23	NUCLEAR REACTOR FOR ISRAEL ?
wsj_0283	24	Israeli officials confirmed that Energy Minister Moshe Shahal and his Canadian counterpart , Jake Epp , discussed a possible Israeli purchase of a $ 1.1 billion Canadian nuclear reactor for producing electricity .
wsj_0283	25	However , a Canadian Embassy official in Tel Aviv said that Canada was unlikely to sell the Candu heavy-water reactor to Israel since Israel has n't signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty .
wsj_0283	26	Israel has been accused in the past of using subterfuge to seek elements needed to develop nuclear weapons .
wsj_0283	27	The South Korean government is signing a protocol today establishing formal diplomatic relations with Poland .
wsj_0283	28	The two are also signing a trade agreement .
wsj_0283	29	South Korean government officials said they do n't expect that Seoul can loan money to Warsaw , but it can `` offer experience . ''
wsj_0283	30	Poland is the second Communist nation to recognize the Seoul government ; South Korea established diplomatic relations with Hungary in February 1989 .
wsj_0283	31	Venezuela will hold a debt-equity auction Friday , with 32 potential bidders participating .
wsj_0283	32	Earlier this year , Venezuela announced it was opening up debt-equity swaps to foreign investors but said the program would be limited to a net disbursement of $ 600 million a year .
wsj_0283	33	Friday 's auction will be limited to $ 150 million disbursed by the Central Bank to potential investors .
wsj_0283	34	The office of foreign investment has authorized some $ 1.78 billion worth of investment proposals , said Edwin Perozo , superintendent of foreign investment .
wsj_0283	35	Most of the proposals are in tourism , basic industry and fishery and agro-industry projects , he said .
wsj_0283	36	Under the debt-equity program , potential investors will submit sealed bids on the percentage of discount they are willing to purchase the debt at , and the bids will be allocated based on these discount offers .
wsj_0283	37	The Venezuelan central bank set a 30 % floor on the bidding .
wsj_0283	38	A song by American singer Tracy Chapman praising jailed black leader Nelson Mandela was banned from South African state radio and television .
wsj_0283	39	The South African Broadcasting Corp. said the song `` Freedom Now '' was `` undesirable for broadcasting . '' ...
wsj_0283	40	Britain 's House of Commons passed a law that will force English soccer fans to carry identity cards to enter stadiums .
wsj_0283	41	The `` anti-hooligan '' law , which would deprive troublemakers of cards , must be ratified by the House of Lords and is expected to become effective early next year .
wsj_0285	0	The amendment , offered by Rep. Douglas Bosco D. , Calif. , was approved 283-132 during debate on a bill designed to strengthen the Transportation Department 's authority in dealing with leveraged buy-outs of airlines .
wsj_0285	1	The bill would require the agency to block the acquisition of 15 % or more of an airline 's stock if the purchase threatened safety , reduced the carrier 's ability to compete , or put the airline under foreign control .
wsj_0285	2	Debate on the legislation , which faces a veto threat from President Bush , is to continue today .
wsj_0285	3	The amendment would require the department to block the purchase of a major airline by anyone who has run two or more carriers that have filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code .
wsj_0285	4	In 1983 , Texas Air 's Continental Airlines filed for bankruptcy .
wsj_0285	5	Earlier this year , Texas Air 's Eastern Airlines filed for bankruptcy .
wsj_0285	6	`` This ought to be subtitled the ` Do n't let Frank Lorenzo take over another airline ' amendment , '' said Rep. James Oberstar D. , Minn. , chairman of the House aviation subcommittee , who argued that the provision was unnecessary because the bill already would give the department ample power to block undesirable deals .
wsj_0287	0	As expected , Warner Bros . Records said it agreed to form a recorded-music and music-publishing joint venture with former MCA Records Chairman Irving Azoff .
wsj_0287	1	Warner said it will provide financing for the venture , but did n't disclose terms .
wsj_0287	2	Mr. Azoff has n't named the company yet , but any records it produces will be distributed by Warner .
wsj_0287	3	Warner is part of Warner Communications Inc. , which is in the process of being acquired by Time Warner Inc .
wsj_0287	4	Mr. Azoff resigned as head of MCA Records , a unit of MCA Inc. , in September , and had been discussing a joint venture with both Warner and MCA .
wsj_0287	5	In a statement yesterday , Mr. Azoff said he chose Warner , the largest record company , because `` their standing in the entertainment industry is second to none .
wsj_0288	0	President Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev will hold an informal meeting in early December , a move that should give both leaders a political boost at home .
wsj_0288	1	The White House is purposely not calling the meeting a summit so that there wo n't be any expectation of detailed negotiations or agreements .
wsj_0288	2	Rather , senior administration officials said that the unexpected meeting was scheduled at Mr. Bush 's request because of his preference for conducting diplomacy through highly personal and informal meetings with other leaders .
wsj_0288	3	The two leaders will meet on Dec. 2 and 3 , alternating the two days of meetings between a U.S. and a Soviet naval vessel in the Mediterranean Sea .
wsj_0288	4	The unusual seaborne meeting wo n't disrupt plans for a formal summit meeting next spring or summer , at which an arms-control treaty is likely to be completed .
wsj_0288	5	In announcing the meeting yesterday , Mr. Bush told reporters at the White House that neither he nor Mr. Gorbachev expects any `` substantial decisions or agreements . ''
wsj_0288	6	Instead , he said that the purpose is simply for the two to get `` better acquainted '' and discuss a wide range of issues without a formal agenda .
wsj_0288	7	Despite the informal nature of the session and the calculated effort to hold down expectations , the meeting could pay significant political dividends for both leaders .
wsj_0288	8	Mr. Gorbachev badly needs a diversion from the serious economic problems and ethnic unrest he faces at home .
wsj_0288	9	American officials have said that a meeting with the leader of the U.S. could help bolster his stature among Soviet politicians and academics , whose support he needs .
wsj_0288	10	For his part , Mr. Bush has been criticized regularly at home for moving too slowly and cautiously in reacting to Mr. Gorbachev 's reforms and the historic moves away from communism in Eastern Europe .
wsj_0288	11	A face-to-face meeting with Mr. Gorbachev should damp such criticism , though it will hardly eliminate it .
wsj_0288	12	Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell D. , Maine , who has been the most prominent Democratic critic of Mr. Bush 's handling of the Soviet relationship , praised the president for arranging the meeting .
wsj_0288	13	But he added : `` The mere fact of a meeting does n't deal with the substance of policy . ''
wsj_0288	14	Mr. Bush said that the December meeting , which was announced simultaneously in Moscow , will be held in the unusual setting of ships at sea to hold down the `` fanfare '' and force the two sides to limit participation to just small groups of advisers .
wsj_0288	15	`` By doing it in this manner we can have , I would say , more time without the press of social activities or mandatory joint appearances , things of that nature for public consumption , '' Mr. Bush said .
wsj_0288	16	Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze , at a news conference in Moscow , said , `` As the two sides plan to hold a full-scale summit in late spring-early summer next year , they found it useful , I would say even necessary , to hold an interim informal meeting . ''
wsj_0288	17	Although no specific agreements are expected , Mr. Shevardnadze said `` that does n't mean they will be without an agenda . ''
wsj_0288	18	If the two leaders cover the subjects that have been featured in lower level U.S.-Soviet meetings , their talks would include human rights , Soviet reforms , regional disputes , relations with allies , economic cooperation , arms control , and joint efforts to fight narcotics , terrorism and pollution .
wsj_0288	19	The president specifically mentioned U.S. economic advice to Moscow as a possible topic .
wsj_0288	20	Mr. Gorbachev has for months been publicly urging the U.S. to drop its restrictions on Soviet trade .
wsj_0288	21	He recently told a small group of American businessmen in Moscow that he hoped to sign a general trade agreement with the U.S. , possibly at the 1990 summit .
wsj_0288	22	The Soviets hope a trade agreement would give them Most-Favored Nation status , which would lower the tariffs on Soviet exports to the U.S. .
wsj_0288	23	In an unusually candid article about the latest economic woe -- unemployment -- Pravda yesterday reported that three million Soviets have lost their jobs as a result of perestroika and the number could grow to 16 million by the year 2005 .
wsj_0288	24	Economists in Moscow are now proposing that the state start a system of unemployment benefits .
wsj_0288	25	But one Bush administration official knowledgeable about the summit plan cautioned against assuming that there will be bold new initiatives on the Soviet economy or other issues .
wsj_0288	26	`` Do n't take this as some big opening for major movement on economic cooperation , or arms control , or the environment , '' he said .
wsj_0288	27	`` Those things will all come up , but in a fairly informal way . ''
wsj_0288	28	Instead , this official said , `` This is vintage George Bush .
wsj_0288	29	This was George Bush 's own idea .
wsj_0288	30	It 's George Bush wanting to meet a foreign leader and talk to him directly . ''
wsj_0288	31	Aside from the Soviet economic plight and talks on cutting strategic and chemical arms , one other issue the Soviets are likely to want to raise is naval force reductions .
wsj_0288	32	Western analysts say that , given the meeting 's setting at sea , Gorbachev is unlikely to pass up the opportunity to press once again for negotiated cuts in the navies of both the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact .
wsj_0288	33	That theme has been a recurring one for Soviet military officials for much of this year .
wsj_0288	34	They argue that as the Kremlin follows through on announced plans to cut land forces -- the Soviets ' area of greatest strength -- the U.S. should show more willingness to cut sea forces -- Washington 's area of greatest superiority .
wsj_0288	35	One of the reasons Bush administration aides are anxious to insist that the coming meeting will be informal is to avoid comparisons with the last such loosely structured superpower gathering , former President Reagan 's 1986 meeting with Mr. Gorbachev in Reykjavik , Iceland .
wsj_0288	36	That meeting sent shivers through the Western alliance because Mr. Reagan was pulled into discussing the possible elimination of nuclear weapons without consulting American allies .
wsj_0288	37	Mr. Bush said that he initiated talks with the Soviets on the informal meeting by sending a proposal to Mr. Gorbachev last July , which the Soviet leader readily accepted .
wsj_0288	38	But word of the possible session was closely held by the president and a handful of top aides , and word of it did n't reach many second-level officials until the past few days .
wsj_0288	39	Indeed , many senior officials had been insisting for weeks that Mr. Bush was n't interested in such an informal get-together .
wsj_0288	40	Though President Bush 's political critics at home have been urging him to open a more direct dialogue with Mr. Gorbachev , it actually was the arguments of leaders within the Soviet bloc itself that led the president to seek the December meeting .
wsj_0288	41	Mr. Bush decided he wanted the meeting after talking in Europe in July with the leaders of Poland and Hungary , who urged him to support Mr. Gorbachev 's efforts to transform the Soviet system and to urge him to loosen his grip on Eastern Europe , a senior aide said .
wsj_0288	42	While flying home from those discussions , Mr. Bush drafted a letter to Mr. Gorbachev suggesting an informal get-together to precede their formal summit next year .

wsj_0289	0	Banca Nazionale del Lavoro said its potential losses from lending to Iraq could reach 1.175 trillion lire $ 872 million , marking the bank 's first quantification of potential costs of unauthorized lending by its Atlanta branch .
wsj_0289	1	BNL previously reported that its Georgia branch had taken on loan commitments topping $ 3 billion without the Rome-based management 's approval .
wsj_0289	2	State-owned BNL , Italy 's largest bank , has filed charges against the branch 's former manager , Christopher Drogoul , and a former branch vice president , alleging fraud and breach of their fiduciary duties .
wsj_0289	3	BNL also said that its board had approved `` after an in-depth discussion , '' a letter to the Bank of Italy outlining measures the state-owned bank has taken or plans to take to improve controls on its foreign branches .
wsj_0289	4	The central bank had ordered BNL to come up with a suitable program by yesterday .
wsj_0289	5	Bank of Italy has also ordered BNL to shore up its capital base to account for potential foreign loan losses , and the Rome bank has outlined a 3 trillion lire capital-raising operation .
wsj_0289	6	BNL was unable to elaborate on what measures were planned by the bank to improve controls on its branches abroad .
wsj_0291	0	Gov. George Deukmejian and key legislators agreed to back a temporary one-quarter-cent increase in the state sales tax to raise $ 800 million for repairs and relief associated with last month 's earthquake .
wsj_0291	1	The tax increase , which will be considered at a special session of the state legislature that begins tomorrow , would cover only part of the estimated $ 4 billion to $ 6 billion in total damage caused by the Oct. 17 quake .
wsj_0291	2	Aside from as much as $ 3.45 billion in recently approved federal aid , the state is expected to draw from a gubernatorial emergency fund that currently stands at an estimated $ 700 million .
wsj_0291	3	`` I am not aware that there is anything but bipartisan agreement for the general outline '' of the revenue-raising plan , said a spokesman for the governor , after a Monday meeting with legislative leaders over the quake-relief question .
wsj_0291	4	The tax increase -- on top of the current six-cent per dollar sales tax -- would become effective this Dec. 1 and expire Dec. 31 , 1990 .
wsj_0291	5	The sales-tax plan was preferred over an alternative that would have boosted the state gasoline tax .
wsj_0291	6	Some legislators expressed concern that a gas-tax increase would take too long and possibly damage chances of a major gas-tax-increasing ballot initiative that voters will consider next June .
wsj_0292	0	Despite continuing problems in its newsprint business , Kimberly-Clark Corp. posted a 20 % gain in third-quarter net income .
wsj_0292	1	The consumer-products and newsprint company said net rose to $ 108.8 million , or $ 1.35 a share , from $ 90.5 million , or $ 1.12 a share , a year ago .
wsj_0292	2	Sales rose 6.2 % to $ 1.45 billion from $ 1.37 billion .
wsj_0292	3	After a flat second quarter tied largely to lower newsprint earnings , Kimberly-Clark attributed the gain to improved results in its consumer businesses in North America , Brazil and Korea .
wsj_0292	4	Those gains came from higher prices , particularly for disposable diapers and tissue products , and from increased sales , primarily for feminine-care products , the company said .
wsj_0292	5	Newsprint results continued to be depressed , the company added , because of industrywide price discounting .
wsj_0292	6	The quarter-to-quarter comparison was also enhanced by charges taken in the year-earlier period , including $ 11 million related to the modernization of a pulp and newsprint mill in Alabama .
wsj_0292	7	In the 1989 period also , interest expense and tax rates were lower than a year ago .
wsj_0292	8	In the first nine months , profit rose 10 % to $ 313.2 million , or $ 3.89 a share , from $ 283.9 million , or $ 3.53 a share .
wsj_0292	9	Sales rose 6.7 % to $ 4.27 billion from $ 4 billion .
wsj_0292	10	In New York Stock Exchange composite trading , Kimberly-Clark closed at $ 66.50 a share , up $ 1.50 .
wsj_0294	0	An arbitrator awarded Eastern Airlines pilots between $ 60 million and $ 100 million in back pay , a decision that could complicate the carrier 's bankruptcy-law reorganization .
wsj_0294	1	Eastern , a unit of Texas Air Corp. , said it is examining the ruling to determine if it can appeal .
wsj_0294	2	It 's unclear whether Eastern will succeed in overturning the arbitrator 's decision , made in a long-simmering `` pay parity '' dispute that predates both the carrier 's Chapter 11 petition and its 1986 acquisition by Texas Air .
wsj_0294	3	All Eastern 's previous court efforts to head off the pilots ' demands have failed .
wsj_0294	4	An Eastern spokesman said he does n't expect that the arbitrator 's ruling `` will have any overall material effect on the company 's strategic plan . ''
wsj_0294	5	Bankruptcy experts said the law is n't clear on how such an arbitration ruling can affect a company 's case .
wsj_0294	6	Like any other creditor , the pilots will have to apply to the court for payment of their claim .
wsj_0294	7	That may leave a lot of leeway for U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland to decide what , if anything , the pilots actually collect .
wsj_0294	8	In August , he issued the ruling that let the pilots pursue their back-pay grievance before the arbitrator .
wsj_0294	9	The pilots ' contract with Eastern calls for a mutually acceptable private arbitrator to resolve such grievances .
wsj_0294	10	In a statement to employees , Eastern said the company was disappointed by the ruling .
wsj_0294	11	`` The obligation is totally unwarranted , '' the statement said .
wsj_0294	12	James Linsey , a lawyer for the Air Line Pilots Association , said the pilots were extremely pleased .
wsj_0294	13	`` This is a blow not only to Eastern but to the creditors committee , '' he said .
wsj_0294	14	Eastern 's creditors committee , along with the company , has consistently opposed the pilots ' claim , which if paid would have to come out of money both hope to use to pay off other bankruptcy claims .
wsj_0294	15	Eastern and its creditors are in the final , delicate stages of negotiating a second reorganization plan to pay off the airline 's debts .
wsj_0294	16	An earlier plan , which had received the creditors ' approval in July , fell apart when Eastern changed its business plan .
wsj_0294	17	It is n't known whether the pilot claim was figured into either plan .
wsj_0294	18	The dispute between Eastern and its pilots is over a `` pay parity '' clause in the pilots ' contract .
wsj_0294	19	The clause was part of an agreement in which pilots accepted a substantial pay cut as long as no other labor group got a raise .
wsj_0294	20	Shortly after Texas Air took control of Eastern , some Machinists union supervisors received a 20 % pay raise .
wsj_0294	21	The pilots argued that this triggered a pay raise for them .
wsj_0294	22	Eastern has disputed the claim , but a federal district court , an appeals court and now the arbitrator have all sided with the pilots .
wsj_0294	23	The two sides do n't even agree about how much money is at issue .
wsj_0294	24	The pilots put the amount as high as $ 100 million , the company at $ 65 million .
wsj_0294	25	Another arbitrator is hearing another pay parity case between Eastern and its pilots , resulting from a similar set of circumstances involving a separate pay raise granted another union .
wsj_0294	26	A decision on that case is n't expected before mid-November .
wsj_0294	27	Ironically , many of the pilots involved have left Eastern or are still striking the carrier , which filed for bankruptcy protection March 9 .
wsj_0294	28	About 800 have crossed the picket lines and returned to work .
wsj_0298	0	Du Pont Co. , Hewlett-Packard Co. and Los Alamos National Laboratory said they signed a three-year , $ 11 million agreement to collaborate on superconductor research .
wsj_0298	1	The collaboration will include at least 25 researchers and will be aimed primarily at developing thin films of high-temperature superconductors for use in electronics , the companies said .
wsj_0298	2	The materials , discovered during the past three years , conduct electricity without resistance and promise smaller , faster computers and other new technologies .
wsj_0298	3	Joint-research programs have proliferated as U.S. companies seek to spread the risks and costs of commercializing new superconductors and to meet the challenges posed by foreign consortia , especially in Japan .
wsj_0298	4	The latest research pact bolsters Du Pont 's growing portfolio of investments in superconductors .
wsj_0298	5	The Wilmington , Del. , chemicals concern previously signed research superconductor agreements with Oak Ridge National Laboratory and with Argonne National Laboratory .
wsj_0298	6	Last year , Du Pont agreed to pay $ 4.5 million for rights to superconductor work at the University of Houston .
wsj_0298	7	Hewlett-Packard is a Palo Alto , Calif. , computer maker .
wsj_0298	8	The Los Alamos laboratory is one of three U.S. Department of Energy national laboratories designed as pilot centers to foster joint industry-government programs to speed the transfer of new superconductors to the marketplace .
wsj_0299	0	J.C. PENNEY Co. , Dallas , said it issued $ 350 million of securities backed by credit-card receivables .
wsj_0299	1	The offering was priced with an 8.95 % coupon rate at 99.1875 % to yield 9.19 % .
wsj_0299	2	The retailer said the securities are expected to be rated triple-A by Standard & Poor 's Corp. and Aaa by Moody 's Investors Service Inc .
wsj_0299	3	They pay interest only for 115 months , with principal payments beginning thereafter .
wsj_0299	4	The expected average life of the certificates is 10 years , with the final scheduled payment in October , 2001 .
wsj_0299	5	First Boston Corp. is sole underwriter .
wsj_0299	6	As part of the transaction , J.C. Penney will sell a portion of its credit-card receivables to its JCP Receivables Inc. unit , which will then transfer them to a master trust .
wsj_0299	7	The trust will issue the certificates .
wsj_0299	8	Credit support will be provided by a letter of credit facility from Credit Suisse in favor of the trustee , Fuji Bank & Trust Co. , for the benefit of the certificate holders .
wsj_0299	9	J.C. Penney will continue to service the receivables .
wsj_0301	0	Shaken by tumbling stock prices and pessimistic projections of U.S. economic growth , currency analysts around the world have toned down their assessments of the dollar 's near-term performance .
wsj_0301	1	Most of the 10 analysts polled last week by Dow Jones International News Service in Frankfurt , Tokyo , London and New York expect the U.S. dollar to ease only mildly in November .
wsj_0301	2	Opinion is mixed over its three-month prospects .
wsj_0301	3	Half of those polled see the currency trending lower over the next three months , while the others forecast a modest rebound after the New Year .
wsj_0301	4	stood at 1.8415 West German marks , ) up from 1.8340 marks late Monday , and at 142.85 yen , ) up from 141.90 yen late Monday .
wsj_0301	5	A month ago , a similar survey predicted the dollar would be trading at 1.8690 marks and 139.75 yen by the end of October .
wsj_0301	6	Sterling was trading at $ 1.5805 , down from $ 1.5820 late Monday .
wsj_0301	7	In Tokyo Wednesday , the U.S. currency was trading at about 142.95 yen at midmorning , up from 142.80 yen at the opening and up from Tuesday 's Tokyo close of 142.15 yen .
wsj_0301	8	The average of estimates of the 10 economists polled puts the dollar around 1.8200 marks at the end of November and at 141.33 yen .
wsj_0301	9	By late January , the consensus calls for the dollar to be trading around 1.8200 marks and near 142 yen .
wsj_0301	10	Those with a bullish view see the dollar trading up near 1.9000 marks and 145 yen , while the dollar bears see the U.S. currency trading around 1.7600 marks and 138 yen .
wsj_0301	11	A number of those polled predict the dollar will slip as the Federal Reserve eases interest rates .
wsj_0301	12	David Owen , an economist at Kleinwort Benson & Co. in London , said he expects further cuts in short-term U.S. rates in an effort to encourage a narrowing of the trade gap and to ensure a soft landing in the U.S. economy .
wsj_0301	13	Robert White , a vice president and manager of corporate trade at First Interstate of California , agreed with that view and predicted the U.S. federal funds rate will drop to between 7 3/4 % and 8 % within 60 days from its current level at 8 13/16 % .
wsj_0301	14	Fed funds is the rate banks charge each other on overnight loans ; the Fed influences the rate by adding or draining reserves from the banking system .
wsj_0301	15	Mr. White also predicted a half-point cut in the U.S. discount rate in the near future .
wsj_0301	16	The discount rate , currently 7 % , is the rate the Fed charges member banks for loans , using government securities as collateral .
wsj_0301	17	He expects such a cut `` because of problems in several sectors of the economy , particularly real estate and automobiles . ''
wsj_0301	18	Bolstering his argument , the Commerce Department reported yesterday that new home sales for September were down 14 % from August 's revised 3.1 % fall .
wsj_0301	19	The drop marked the largest monthly tumble since a 19 % slide in January 1982 .
wsj_0301	20	In last month 's survey , a number of currency analysts predicted the dollar would be pressured by a narrowing of interest rate differentials between the U.S. and West Germany .
wsj_0301	21	Indeed , in early October the West German central bank raised its discount and Lombard rates by a full percentage point .
wsj_0301	22	Several other European central banks , notably in Britain , followed the West German Bundesbank 's lead by raising their own key rates .
wsj_0301	23	And a week later , Japan raised its official discount rate by a half point to 3.75 % .
wsj_0301	24	The Japanese discount rate is the central bank 's base rate on loans to commercial banks .
wsj_0301	25	After a surprisingly sharp widening in the U.S. August merchandise trade deficit -- $ 10.77 billion from a revised $ 8.24 billion in July and well above expectations -- and a startling 190-point drop in stock prices on Oct. 13 , the Federal Reserve relaxed short-term interest rates , knocking fed funds from around 9 % to 8 3/4 % .
wsj_0301	26	But predictions that central banks of the Group of Seven G-7 major industrial nations would continue their massive dollar sales went astray , as the market drove the dollar downward on its own , reacting to Wall Street 's plunge and subsequent price volatility , lower U.S. interest rates and signs of a slowing U.S. economy .
wsj_0301	27	G-7 consists of the U.S. , Japan , Britain , West Germany , Canada , France and Italy .
wsj_0301	28	Tomoshige Kakita , senior deputy manager in the treasury department of Mitsui Bank Ltd. in Tokyo , suggested that uncertainty about U.S. stocks and bonds has made Japanese investors leery of holding those securities in the near term , thus damping dollar demand .
wsj_0301	29	But , Mr. Kakita added , once U.S. equities regain some stability , players will move back into dollar-denominated investments , especially Treasury bonds , whose value rises when interest rates decline .
wsj_0301	30	Mr. Kakita said the key dollar-yen exchange rate is at 135 yen .
wsj_0301	31	`` If 135 is broken , some panic will be seen , '' he predicted , explaining that Japanese institutions are comfortable with the dollar anywhere between current levels and 135 yen .
wsj_0301	32	Jens-Uwe Fischer , a senior trader at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. in Frankfurt , said he expects the dollar to recover within the next three months to around 1.88 marks as U.S. economic data , particularly U.S. trade figures , level off .
wsj_0301	33	He contended that the Fed wo n't ease rates further , but predicted Bundesbank officials will relax key rates in West Germany .
wsj_0301	34	Alfred Zapfel , chief trader at Bank of Boston in Frankfurt , took an opposite stance .
wsj_0301	35	He said he expects U.S. interest rates to decline , dragging the dollar down to around 1.80 marks by the end of January after a short-lived dash to 1.87 marks by the end of November .
wsj_0301	36	West German interest rates , he said , will remain unchanged .
wsj_0301	37	`` But I 'm not one of these great dollar bears you see more of these days , '' Mr. Zapfel said .
wsj_0301	38	`` I ca n't really see it dropping far below 1.80 marks . ''
wsj_0301	39	Scott Greene , chief foreign exchange dealer with Julius Baer & Co. in New York , fits the description of a `` great dollar bear . ''
wsj_0301	40	He predicted the U.S. unit will skid below 1.80 marks to around 1.78 marks this month and 1.75 marks by the beginning of the new year .
wsj_0301	41	`` We 're finally seeing the culmination of all the recessionary buildup of the last few months , '' he said , noting a continuing downward trend in U.S. interest rates , a shaky stock market and `` gloomier economic times ahead '' all signal a significantly lower dollar .
wsj_0301	42	In the wake of British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson 's surprise resignation and sterling 's subsequent nose-dive , most analysts had little good to say about the pound 's near-term prospects .
wsj_0301	43	Mr. Owen of Kleinwort Benson suggested that the new chancellor , John Major , will take a tough line in his autumn statement later this month , helping to underpin the pound .
wsj_0301	44	But , he warned , the currency will remain at risk .
wsj_0301	45	On the Commodity Exchange in New York , gold for current delivery dropped $ 3.10 to $ 374.70 an ounce in moderate trading .
wsj_0301	46	Estimated volume was 3.5 million ounces .
wsj_0301	47	In early trading in Hong Kong Wednesday , gold was quoted at $ 373.80 an ounce .

wsj_0302	0	West Germany will repeal the unpopular turnover tax on securities transactions as of Jan. 1 , 1991 , Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann said .
wsj_0302	1	He said the government will also repeal the 1 % transaction tax on the first-time purchase of stakes in companies .
wsj_0302	2	The announcement follows several comments by government officials that the government will speed up the repeal of the tax , which was originally scheduled to fall with the start of the single internal market in the European Community at the end of 1992 .
wsj_0302	3	The securities-turnover tax has been long criticized by the West German financial community because it tends to drive securities trading and other banking activities out of Frankfurt into rival financial centers , especially London , where trading transactions is n't taxed .
wsj_0302	4	The tax has raised less than one billion marks $ 545.3 million annually in recent years , but the government has been reluctant to abolish the levy for budgetary concerns .
wsj_0302	5	In the interview , Mr. Haussmann did n't specify the amount of revenue the government will lose after the tax disappears .
wsj_0302	6	The new date means that the tax will be officially repealed before the end of the current parliamentary term at the end of 1990 and guarantees its abolition even if the current center-right coalition loses the elections in December 1990 .
wsj_0303	0	Earlier this year , President Bush made a final `` take-it-or-leave it '' offer on the minimum wage : an increase to $ 4.25 an hour over three years , and only if accompanied by a lower wage for the first six months of a job .
wsj_0303	1	Now , the White House has decided to accept the higher wage over only two years .
wsj_0303	2	The sub-minimum wage would apply only to first-time teen-age workers for 90 days .
wsj_0303	3	The White House had enough votes to sustain a veto but chose to avoid a confrontation .
wsj_0303	4	The only permanent losers will be the 200,000 or so workers everyone agrees will be priced out of a job at the $ 4.25 rate Congress is likely to approve today .
wsj_0303	5	It is compromises such as this that convince Washington 's liberals that if they simply stay the course , this administration will stray from its own course on this and other issues .
wsj_0306	0	Farm prices in October edged up 0.7 % from September as raw milk prices continued their rise , the Agriculture Department said .
wsj_0306	1	Milk sold to the nation 's dairy plants and dealers averaged $ 14.50 for each hundred pounds , up 50 cents from September and up $ 1.50 from October 1988 , the department said .
wsj_0306	2	Commercial vegetables , led by lettuce and tomatoes , rose 19 % in October ; oranges and other fruits rose 5 % .
wsj_0306	3	Broiler prices fell 6.5 cents in October to 30.6 cents a pound , while turkey prices rose 1.2 cents a pound to 38.5 cents .

wsj_0307	0	Paramount Communications Inc. , New York , completed the sale of its Associates Corp. consumer and commercial finance subsidiary to a unit of Ford Motor Co. for $ 3.35 billion .
wsj_0307	1	Paramount , which agreed to sell the unit in July , said it would realize net proceeds from the sale of $ 2.6 billion , with an after-tax gain of $ 1.2 billion .
wsj_0307	2	Paramount said the gain would be recorded in its fourth quarter , which ended yesterday .
wsj_0307	3	Paramount said the sale `` completes the strategic restructuring '' it began in 1983 , and would enable it to focus on its entertainment and publishing businesses .
wsj_0307	4	Ford said in July it planned to operate Associates , based in Dallas , as a separate entity in its Ford Financial Services Group .
wsj_0307	5	Paramount said Associates has about $ 14 billion in total assets , making it third-largest in terms of assets among independent finance companies in the U.S. .
wsj_0308	0	Sea Containers Ltd. , in a long-awaited move to repel a hostile takeover bid , said it will sell $ 1.1 billion of assets and use some of the proceeds to buy about 50 % of its common shares for $ 70 apiece .
wsj_0308	1	Together with the 3.6 million shares currently controlled by management , subsidiaries and directors , the completed tender offer would give Sea Containers a controlling stake .
wsj_0308	2	Describing itself as `` asset rich , '' Sea Containers said it will move immediately to sell two ports , various ferries , ferry services , containers , and other investments .
wsj_0308	3	Of the proceeds , $ 500 million will be used to fund its tender offer .
wsj_0308	4	Sea Containers added that the recapitalization plan will reduce its debt by more than $ 500 million .
wsj_0308	5	The company , which has 13.8 million common shares outstanding , said in mid-June that it was considering a restructuring to ward off a hostile takeover attempt by two European shipping concerns .
wsj_0308	6	In late May , Stena Holding AG and Tiphook PLC , launched a $ 50-a-share , or $ 777 million , tender offer for the Hamilton , Bermuda-based Sea Containers .
wsj_0308	7	In mid-August , the companies , through their jointly owned holding company , Temple Holdings Ltd. , sweetened the offer to $ 63 a share , or $ 963 million .
wsj_0308	8	Officials for Temple declined to comment .
wsj_0308	9	News of the restructuring plan sent Sea Containers ' shares up $ 1 to $ 62 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading .
wsj_0308	10	Walter Kirchberger , an analyst with PaineWebber Inc. , said that offering holders a higher , $ 70-a-share price is `` a fairly effective method of blocking '' the Stena-Tiphook bid .
wsj_0308	11	Michael Carstens , an analyst with Tucker Anthony & R.L. Day , added that the sale of assets would allow Sea Containers to focus on its core container businesses .

wsj_0336	0	LTV Steel Co. is boosting the prices of flat rolled steel products by an average of 3 % following a recent erosion in the prices of such crucial steel products .
wsj_0336	1	The big questions are whether the increase , effective Jan. 1 , 1990 , will stick , and whether other major steelmakers will follow suit .
wsj_0336	2	It is widely expected that they will .
wsj_0336	3	The increase is on the base price , which is already being discounted by virtually all steel producers .
wsj_0336	4	But LTV 's move marks the first effort by a major steelmaker to counter the free fall in spot prices .
wsj_0336	5	Major steel producers are selling cold rolled sheet steel at about $ 370 a ton , compared with a peak price of $ 520 a ton in 1988 .
wsj_0336	6	Second-tier companies are receiving even less per ton .
wsj_0336	7	LTV 's planned increase , which was announced in an Oct. 26 memo to district managers , does n't affect electrogalvanized steel or tin plate .
wsj_0336	8	LTV confirmed the price-increase plan , saying the move is designed to more accurately reflect the value of products and to put steel on more equal footing with other commodities .
wsj_0336	9	A spokesman for LTV Steel , which is a unit of Dallas-based LTV Corp. , noted that steel prices , adjusted for inflation , increased only 1.7 % between 1981 and the fourth quarter of 1988 , while the prices of other industrial commodities increased nearly five times as much .
wsj_0336	10	At the same time , steelmakers are trying to invest more to modernize technology and make themselves more competitive .
wsj_0336	11	But analysts say the company is also trying to prevent further price drops .
wsj_0336	12	Moreover , they note that LTV may be trying to send a signal to major customers , such as Chrysler Corp. and Whirlpool Corp. , that steelmakers need more money .
wsj_0336	13	Both companies are in the process of negotiating contracts with LTV and others .
wsj_0336	14	`` They LTV ) may believe this can impact contract negotiations and is their signal to the world that now is the time to get tough on prices , '' said Peter Marcus , an analyst with PaineWebber Inc .
wsj_0336	15	Mr. Marcus believes spot steel prices will continue to fall through early 1990 and then reverse themselves .
wsj_0336	16	He is n't convinced , though , that the price decline reflects falling demand because the world economy remains relatively strong .
wsj_0336	17	And while customers such as steel service centers are continuing to reduce inventories through the fourth quarter , they eventually will begin stocking up again , he notes .
wsj_0336	18	It wo n't be clear for months whether the price increase will stick .
wsj_0336	19	Steelmakers announced a round of base-price increases last year , but began offering sizable discounts over the summer .
wsj_0336	20	In fact , LTV was the first steelmaker to publicly boost discounts for buyers of cold rolled sheet steel and hot-dipped galvanized sheet steel .
wsj_0336	21	In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday , LTV common shares fell 12.5 cents to close at $ 1.50 .

wsj_0342	0	Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. said unconsolidated pretax earnings in the fiscal first half surged 79 % to a record 63.25 billion yen $ 445.7 million , reflecting strong demand for a variety of products .

wsj_0343	0	Senate leaders traded proposals aimed at speeding action on legislation to narrow the deficit and raise the federal government 's debt limit -- but the major stumbling block remains President Bush 's proposal to cut the capital-gains tax rate .
wsj_0343	1	Democrats want the tax provision to be a separate bill , subject to the usual procedural obstacles .
wsj_0343	2	Republicans , meanwhile , want to try to protect the measure by combining it with two politically popular issues that Democrats could find hard to block .
wsj_0343	3	The talks between Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine and his GOP counterpart , Sen. Robert Dole of Kansas , are expected to resume today .
wsj_0343	4	Last night , after meeting with Mr. Bush and administration officials at the White House , Mr. Dole proposed streamlining the fiscal 1990 deficit-reduction bill , now stalled in a House-Senate conference committee , and passing a long-term extension of the federal debt ceiling without any accompanying amendments .
wsj_0343	5	Under this plan , two provisions currently in the House version of the deficit-cutting bill -- repeal of both the catastrophic-illness insurance program and a controversial 1986 tax provision intended to counter discrimination in employee-benefit plans -- would be made into a separate bill .
wsj_0343	6	Republicans would try to attach a capital-gains provision to that legislation , hoping the political popularity of its other two parts would dissuade Democrats from blocking it .
wsj_0343	7	Democrats want to avoid having to make that choice by making the capital-gains tax cut an individual bill .
wsj_0343	8	Sen. Mitchell is confident he has sufficient votes to block such a measure with procedural actions .
wsj_0343	9	Both plans would drop child-care provisions from the House version of the deficit-reduction legislation and let it progress as a separate bill .
wsj_0343	10	While that could make it vulnerable to a veto by Mr. Bush , Democrats argue that a presidential rejection would give their party a valuable issue in next year 's congressional elections .
wsj_0343	11	Senate Democrats are to meet today to consider the GOP proposal .
wsj_0343	12	Yesterday , Mr. Dole seemed weary of the Bush administration 's strategy of pushing the capital-gains measure at every chance in the face of Democratic procedural hurdles .
wsj_0343	13	Pushing the issue on legislation needed to avoid default by the federal government , he told reporters , `` does n't seem to be very good strategy to me . ''
wsj_0343	14	At 12:01 a.m. EST today , the federal government 's temporary $ 2.87 trillion debt limit expired .
wsj_0343	15	To avoid default , lawmakers must pass legislation raising the limit to $ 3.12 trillion from $ 2.80 trillion by next Wednesday , according to the Treasury .
wsj_0343	16	Pressed by Chairman Dan Rostenkowski D. , Ill . of the House Ways and Means Committee , Treasury Undersecretary Robert Glauber told a congressional hearing that the administration would give up its demand for the capital-gains tax cut if faced with a potential default .

wsj_0344	6	The company attributed the decrease in part to the exclusion of the company 's British sales from the current year 's figures as a result of the subsidiary 's status as a proposed discontinued operation and , in part , to lower sales in certain key foreign and domestic accounts .

wsj_0353	0	A governing body of both the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Governmental Accounting Standards Board voted to give the FASB jurisdiction over accounting standards for certain government-owned entities .
wsj_0353	1	The Financial Accounting Foundation voted 12-2 that FASB accounting rules supercede GASB rules in regard to utilities , hospitals , and colleges and universities owned by the government .
wsj_0353	2	GASB rules still apply for other government units .
wsj_0353	3	After the GASB was founded in 1984 , 11 years after the FASB , the government-owned entities were supposed to follow FASB rules unless the GASB superceded them .
wsj_0353	4	The GASB had told governments they did n't have to follow FASB rules on depreciation , making it difficult for bond-rating agencies to compare private and state-owned schools , which compete in the public bond market .
wsj_0353	5	The foundation vote is effective for the affected government entities with fiscal years that begin starting next Jan. 1 and makes the financial results of the hospitals , colleges and schools easier to compare with for-profit businesses .
wsj_0353	6	But it may lead to separate financial reports based on different rules for the government entities under FASB rules and those still under GASB rules .
wsj_0353	7	`` Managers of government entities are often more concerned with the political and legal structure and financial-report comparability with profit-making businesses is n't always as high a priority , '' a foundation spokesman said .
wsj_0354	0	Avery Inc. said it completed the sale of Uniroyal Chemical Holding Co. to a group led by management of Uniroyal Chemical Co. , the unit 's main business .
wsj_0354	1	It valued the transaction at $ 800 million .
wsj_0354	2	Avery , which continues to operate a coal company it expects to sell at a loss , said in proxy materials it intends to seek control of one or more companies .
wsj_0354	3	After fees and repayment of debt , Avery is left with about $ 24 million in cash and securities from the Uniroyal sale .
wsj_0354	4	Avery paid $ 750 million , including various legal and financing fees , to acquire Uniroyal Chemical , Middlebury , Conn. , in 1986 -- a move that burdened Avery with debt .
wsj_0354	5	In over-the-counter trading , Avery shares were quoted yesterday at a bid price of 93.75 cents a share .
wsj_0354	6	According to Avery , for the year ended Sept. 30 , 1988 , Uniroyal Chemical had sales of $ 734.2 million and a net loss of $ 47.1 million .
wsj_0354	7	An Avery spokesman said that the loss was magnified by accounting adjustments and that the company 's loss was smaller on a cash basis .
wsj_0354	8	Uniroyal has 2,600 employees and facilities in the U.S. , Canada , Brazil , Italy and Taiwan .
wsj_0354	9	In a related development , Avery said it completed a recapitalization in which its controlling shareholders and top officers , Nelson Peltz and Peter W. May , surrendered warrants and preferred stock in exchange for a larger stake in Avery 's common shares .
wsj_0354	10	On a fully diluted basis , the two raised their stake to 68 % from 51 % .
wsj_0354	11	In December 1988 , Messrs. Peltz and May sold their stock in Triangle Industries Inc. , a packaging company they controlled , to Pechiney Corp. of France .
wsj_0354	12	The executives had profited handsomely by building American National Can Co. , Triangle 's chief asset .
wsj_0354	13	In January 1989 , the two men acquired the non-packaging assets of Triangle , including a controlling stake in Avery and , by extension , Uniroyal Chemical .
wsj_0354	14	In the August proxy material , Avery said that unless it sold Uniroyal , its ability to service debt would be hurt and Avery 's shareholder value would `` continue to erode . ''
wsj_0354	15	Until Avery makes an acquisition , Messrs. Peltz and May will waive their direct salaries and bonuses , the company said .
wsj_0354	16	For at least the next six months , however , Avery will continue to pay $ 200,000 a month for management services to a company controlled by Messrs. Peltz and May , according to the proxy material .
wsj_0355	0	Clarcor Inc. said a plan to sell its J.L. Clark Inc. subsidiary to a group headed by Anderson Industries Inc. for $ 70.3 million has been terminated .
wsj_0355	1	Clarcor , a maker of packaging and filtration products , said the two companies could n't agree on terms of a definitive agreement .
wsj_0355	2	The sale price of the unit , which makes packaging products , was to consist of cash , notes and an amount to be determined by the unit 's future performance .
wsj_0355	3	Clarcor said it is inviting proposals from other prospective purchasers of the unit .
wsj_0355	4	Both Clarcor and Anderson are based in Rockford , Ill .
wsj_0356	0	Rally 's Inc. said it adopted a shareholders rights plan to protect shareholders from an inadequately priced takeover offer .
wsj_0356	1	The plan provides for the distribution of one common stock-purchase right as a dividend for each share of common outstanding .
wsj_0356	2	Each right entitles shareholders to buy one-half share of common for $ 30 .
wsj_0356	3	Earlier this month , a group led by three of the company 's directors , Burt Sugarman , James M. Trotter III and Willam E. Trotter II , indicated it had a 45.2 % stake in the Louisville , Ky. , fast-food company and that it planned to seek a majority of seats on Rally 's nine-member board .
wsj_0356	4	The company said it was `` concerned about the announced intent to acquire control of the company '' by a Sugarman-led group .
wsj_0357	0	Fujitsu Ltd. said it wants to withdraw its controversial one-yen bid to design a waterworks computer system for the city of Hiroshima .
wsj_0357	1	Meanwhile , Japan 's Fair Trade Commission said it was considering launching an investigation into whether the bid , the equivalent of less than a penny , violates anti-monopoly laws .
wsj_0357	2	Hiroshima last week held an auction to pick the contractor , expecting to pay about 11 million yen for the project .
wsj_0357	3	Eight companies submitted bids , but Fujitsu won the contract by essentially saying it would do the job for free .
wsj_0357	4	News of the bid drew sharp criticism from other computer companies and industry observers .
wsj_0357	5	Fujitsu itself , which said the bid had n't been approved by its headquarters , was clearly embarrassed .
wsj_0357	6	The bid was n't `` socially acceptable , '' a company spokeswoman said .
wsj_0357	7	Hiroshima officials said they still consider the contract in effect and had no immediate plans to cancel it .
wsj_0357	8	They said they wanted to wait for the outcome of any government investigation before deciding what to do .
wsj_0358	0	The city 's Department of Consumer Affairs charged Newmark & Lewis Inc. with failing to deliver on its promise of lowering prices .
wsj_0358	1	In a civil suit commenced in state Supreme Court in New York , the agency alleged that the consumer-electronics and appliance discount-retailing chain engaged in deceptive advertising by claiming to have `` lowered every price on every item '' as part of an advertising campaign that began June 1 .
wsj_0358	2	The agency said it monitored Newmark & Lewis 's advertised prices before and after the ad campaign , and found that the prices of at least 50 different items either increased or stayed the same .
wsj_0358	3	In late May , Newmark & Lewis announced a plan to cut prices 5 % to 20 % and eliminate what it called a `` standard discount-retailing practice '' of negotiating individual deals with customers .
wsj_0358	4	The consumer agency also disputed Newmark & Lewis 's continuing strategy of advertising `` new lower prices '' when allgedly there have n't been price reductions since June 1 .
wsj_0358	5	Richard D. Lewis , president of the 47-store chain , defended the company 's pricing campaign , saying it did n't use `` the misleading expression ` reduced from original prices . ' ''
wsj_0358	6	Mr. Lewis said the company marked price tags and advertised at its `` lowest possible prices '' for all its merchandise to reduce public confusion .
wsj_0358	7	Mr. Lewis said the company gave the Consumer Affairs department `` volumes of documents '' to substantiate its statements , and made `` every effort to comply '' with all the agency 's policies .
wsj_0358	8	In its suit , the consumer agency seeks fines of $ 1,000 per violation of the city 's Consumer Protection Law , costs of investigation , and an injunction to prevent Newmark & Lewis from continuing its allegedly deceptive advertising .
wsj_0361	0	Nearly two months after saying it had been the victim of widespread fraud , MiniScribe Corp. disclosed it had a negative net worth of $ 88 million as of July 2 and hinted that it might be forced to file for protection under bankruptcy laws .
wsj_0361	1	Richard Rifenburgh , chairman and chief executive of the Longmont , Colo. , disk-drive maker , also said the company continued losing money in the third quarter and expects to sustain further losses through the end of the year .
wsj_0361	2	Mr. Rifenburgh told industry analysts he is moving `` aggressively '' to negotiate out-of-court settlements on a number of shareholder lawsuits , but noted that the company could file for bankruptcy-law protection if settlement talks fail .
wsj_0361	3	Mr. Rifenburgh also noted that 150 million shares of MiniScribe common stock were traded during the past three years , `` so there 's a tremendous amount of exposure . ''
wsj_0361	4	MiniScribe has said that its financial results for the past three fiscal years would have to be restated because of the allegedly fraudulent accounting and marketing practices that inflated revenues and net income .
wsj_0361	5	MiniScribe also has n't filed any financial statements for 1989 .
wsj_0361	6	Mr. Rifenburgh said such statements should be ready by the end of November .
wsj_0361	7	He said he expects the company to have $ 500 million in sales for this year .
wsj_0361	8	He did n't say what the company expected to report for year-earlier sales , which will be restated from the previously reported $ 603 million .
wsj_0361	9	The release of MiniScribe 's new balance sheet came one day after it introduced its new line of one-inch disk drives , on which it is pinning much of its hope for survival .
wsj_0361	10	Although it is not the first company to produce the thinner drives , which store information in personal computers , MiniScribe says it is the first with an 80-megabyte drive ; the company plans to introduce a 120-megabyte drive next year .
wsj_0361	11	Analysts and consultants had mixed reactions to yesterday 's announcements , praising Mr. Rifenburgh 's efforts but questioning whether the company can survive in a highly competitive marketplace .
wsj_0361	12	`` It 's a wait-and-see attitude , '' said Dave Vellante , vice president of storage research for International Data Corp .
wsj_0361	13	Others pointed out that at least four other disk-drive makers will have competitive one-inch drives early next year and that the industry already operates on very thin margins .
wsj_0361	14	The company also faces delisting by the National Association of Securities Dealers .
wsj_0361	15	The company continues to trade in the over-the-counter market with an exception to listing requirements .
wsj_0361	16	MiniScribe filed a status report with the NASD on Monday , detailing its efforts to comply with listing requirements and requesting an extension of the exception , but has n't received a response .
wsj_0361	17	MiniScribe common closed yesterday at $ 1.9375 , down 6.25 cents , and has been trading for several months at less than $ 3 a share .
wsj_0361	18	Meanwhile , U.S. Attorney Jerry Rafferty in Denver is reviewing the report prepared by MiniScribe 's outside directors , to determine if criminal charges should be brought before a grand jury .
wsj_0361	19	The MiniScribe report outlines a host of allegedly fraudulent practices , including the shipment of bricks and defective disk drives that were booked as sales , and inventory forgeries in accounting records .
wsj_0361	20	The internal investigation also criticized MiniScribe 's auditors , Coopers & Lybrand , for allegedly ignoring numerous red flags .
wsj_0361	21	Mr. Rifenburgh said the board still has n't acted on most of the internal report 's recommendations , pending restatement of the balance sheet .
wsj_0361	22	He added that he expects to make a recommendation within a few weeks on whether MiniScribe should file its own lawsuits against former company officers and directors .
wsj_0363	0	Bankers Trust New York Corp. won permission from the Federal Reserve Board to move the company 's private placement department to its fledgling securities subsidiary .
wsj_0363	1	The seemingly mundane action , which was opposed by the Securities Industry Association , a trade group , has important implications for banks ' recent entry into the underwriting of corporate securities .
wsj_0363	2	The Fed 's action increases the volume of publicly registered securities that banks ' securities affiliates will be able to underwrite .
wsj_0363	3	Several other banks have similar applications pending .
wsj_0363	4	Over the past two years , the Fed has given a handful of banks ' securities affiliates permission to underwrite and deal in a variety of corporate , asset-backed and municipal securities that had previously been the sole domain of securities firms .
wsj_0363	5	Securities firms have challenged those Fed approvals , saying they violate federal laws separating the banking and securities businesses .
wsj_0363	6	However , the Fed limited the revenue that banks could earn from these new underwriting activities to no more than 10 % of the revenue earned from other securities activities long open to banks , such as dealing in U.S. Treasurys .
wsj_0363	7	For some banks that 10 % ceiling created problems .
wsj_0363	8	But , by allowing BT Securities Inc. to handle private placements , the Fed boosted the volume of new types of underwriting that the unit can do .
wsj_0363	9	Private placements involve debt and equity securities , typically in denominations of $ 1 million , that are sold to institutional investors and are n't registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission .
wsj_0363	10	Last year , Bankers Trust said it placed $ 10 billion of corporate debt and equities privately .

wsj_0364	3	The percent difference compares actual profit with the 30-day estimate where at least three analysts have issues forecasts in the past 30 days .
wsj_0364	4	Otherwise , actual profit is compared with the 300-day estimate .

wsj_0373	0	The head of British Satellite Broadcasting Ltd. said he hopes to raise about # 450 million $ 711 million before the satellite-TV venture makes its delayed debut next spring -- with a major chunk coming from new investors .
wsj_0373	1	`` We 'll raise it through bank loans .
wsj_0373	2	We 'll raise it through new equity .
wsj_0373	3	And we 'll raise it through existing shareholders '' as well as through junk bonds , said Anthony Simonds-Gooding , the private consortium 's chief executive .
wsj_0373	4	He said he believes the bank loan , to be arranged by February , will supply about half of the financing .
wsj_0373	5	British Satellite , which already has raised # 423.5 million from 10 backers , initially expected to seek an additional # 400 million .
wsj_0373	6	Mr. Simonds-Gooding said the additional financing may leave British Satellite owned by about 20 investors , including Australian entrepreneur Alan Bond , whose nearly 36 % stake would be reduced to as little as 20 % .
wsj_0373	7	Bond Corp. , British Satellite 's biggest investor , would like to withdraw from the satellite-TV consortium , and analysts have speculated Hollywood studios might buy the Bond stake .
wsj_0373	8	But Mr. Simonds-Gooding said he is n't talking to any studios about investing .
wsj_0373	9	Besides Bond Corp. , British Satellite 's other backers include Pearson PLC , Reed International PLC and Granada Group PLC .
wsj_0373	10	The consortium faced a setback in May when technical problems forced it to postpone the September launch until next spring .
wsj_0373	11	Continued uncertainty about the timing of the consortium 's debut could make it hard to find a # 450 million cash injection .
wsj_0373	12	Mr. Simonds-Gooding conceded that British Satellite 's potential U.K. lenders `` are saying , ` When you 're on the air , you 'll actually get the money . ' ''
wsj_0373	13	The bankers also insist that the loans depend on the consortium raising more money from new and existing backers .
wsj_0373	14	British Satellite today is unveiling a # 30 million advertising and promotional drive for the consortium 's planned five channels of movies , sports , entertainment and news shows .
wsj_0373	15	As part of the drive , the first 50,000 viewers who put up # 10 each will get a package valued at # 170 -- including a satellite receiving dish , equipment installation and a three-month subscription to its pay-movie service .
wsj_0373	16	British Satellite faces competition from Sky Television , a satellite-TV venture begun last February and owned by Rupert Murdoch 's News Corp .

wsj_0376	2	The establishment of the separate company , to be called Courtaulds Textiles , could be effective as early as next year 's first quarter .
wsj_0376	3	Investors welcomed the move .
wsj_0376	4	Courtaulds ' shares rose 15 pence to 362 pence , valuing the entire company at about # 1.44 billion .
wsj_0376	5	Courtaulds ' spinoff reflects pressure on British industry to boost share prices beyond the reach of corporate raiders .
wsj_0376	6	Courtaulds ' restructuring is among the largest thus far in Britain , though it is dwarfed by B.A.T Industries PLC 's plans to spin off roughly # 4 billion in assets to help fend off a takeover bid from Anglo-French financier Sir James Goldsmith .
wsj_0376	7	The divested Courtaulds textile operations had operating profit of # 50 million on # 980 million in revenue in the year ended March 31 .
wsj_0376	8	Some analysts have said Courtaulds ' moves could boost the company 's value by 5 % to 10 % , because the two entities separately will carry a higher price earnings multiple than they did combined .
wsj_0376	9	In addition , Courtaulds said the moves are logical because they will allow both the chemicals and textile businesses to focus more closely on core activities .
wsj_0376	10	Courtaulds has been under pressure to enhance shareholder value since takeover speculators -- including Australian financier Kerry Packer -- surfaced holding small stakes last year .
wsj_0376	11	Though Mr. Packer has since sold his stake , Courtaulds is moving to keep its institutional shareholders happy .
wsj_0376	12	Even without a specific takeover threat , Courtaulds is giving shareholders `` choice and value , '' said Julia Blake , an analyst at London stockbrokers Barclays de Zoete Wedd .
wsj_0376	13	In a statement , the company said : `` Both parts can only realize their full potential and be appropriately valued by the market if they are separately quoted companies .
wsj_0376	14	The sharper definition and the autonomy which each will thereby gain will benefit shareholders , customers and employees . ''
wsj_0376	15	Courtaulds Chairman and Chief Executive Sir Christopher Hogg will remain in both posts at the surviving chemical company after the spinoff .
wsj_0377	0	Sanwa Shutter Corp. said its affiliated company in Malaysia , established this April , will begin manufacturing steel doors Wednesday .

wsj_0377	2	Company officials said the new company , Sin Kean Boon-Sanwa J.V . is capitalized at the equivalent of 54 million yen $ 381,000 .
wsj_0377	3	The Japanese concern has a 40 % stake , while the local partner has a 60 % stake .

wsj_0379	1	Officials at the Japanese semiconductor maker said the company intends to increase investment in plant and equipment by 10 billion yen $ 70.6 million , to 90 billion yen , in the year ending March 31 , with the extra funds used to increase production overseas .
wsj_0379	2	Officials said they were n't sure how the money will be distributed among overseas units , but added that NEC Semiconductors U.K. Ltd. will receive priority .
wsj_0379	3	Officials also disclosed it 's possible that NEC may reduce domestic production of one-megabit chips to five million a month from six million , beginning January , because of deteriorating market prices .
wsj_0380	0	Japan 's steel exports fell 12.2 % in September from a year earlier and were down 1.1 % from the previous month , the Japan Iron and Steel Federation reported .
wsj_0380	1	September was the 10th consecutive month in which steel exports failed to reach the year-earlier level .
wsj_0380	2	A federation official attributed the decline to brisk demand from domestic industries backed by continuing economic expansion in Japan .
wsj_0380	3	Japanese steel companies are apparently focusing on domestic sales , but the official said it does n't necessarily mean that local sales contracts are increasing that markedly .
wsj_0380	4	`` They are just too busy to meet domestic demand and have little room for overseas shipments , '' the official said .

wsj_0401	2	Such transactions numbered 670 in the second quarter , up from 527 a year earlier .
wsj_0401	3	However , the total value declined for deals of $ 100 million and up .
wsj_0401	4	The downturn in total value may be only temporary , suggested Herb Adler , a KPMG Peat Marwick partner .
wsj_0401	5	He explained , in part , that restructuring to prepare for the Common Market expansion due in 1992 `` has become more of a strategic priority , both for companies inside and outside the European Community . ''
wsj_0401	6	In the second quarter , middle-market cross-border transactions -- deals under $ 100 million each -- numbered 619 and totaled $ 6 billion , compared with 478 such transactions totaling $ 4.9 billion a year earlier , the firm said .

wsj_0407	0	President Bush said that three members of his cabinet will lead a presidential mission to Poland to gauge how the U.S. can help the new non-Communist government 's economic changes .
wsj_0407	1	Mr. Bush announced several weeks ago that he intended to send such a mission , composed of top government aides and business and labor leaders .
wsj_0407	2	The mission will visit Poland from Nov. 29 to Dec. 2 , the White House said .

wsj_0412	0	Private housing starts in Japan were unchanged in September from a year earlier at 144,610 units , the Construction Ministry said .
wsj_0412	1	The flat report followed a four-month string of declines .
wsj_0412	2	The down trend was partly the result of tighter credit sparked by a discount rate increase by the Bank of Japan in May .
wsj_0412	3	The central bank also unexpectedly raised the base rate by half a percentage point to 3.75 % Oct. 11 as part of an inflation-fighting move that indirectly increases interest rates charged on new home construction loans .
wsj_0417	0	A group of Michigan investors has offered to buy Knight-Ridder Inc. 's ailing Detroit Free Press for $ 68 million but has left unclear how the offer will be financed .
wsj_0417	1	The offer came just prior to arguments before the U.S. Supreme Court over whether the Free Press should be allowed to enter into a joint operating pact with Gannett Co. 's Detroit News .
wsj_0417	2	The group led by Birmingham , Mich. , publicist William D. McMaster did n't name an investment banker backing the deal or say how much its members will contribute to the offer .
wsj_0417	3	Indeed , some individuals identified with the group said they have n't committed any money to the bid and were n't aware of it until they heard about it in local news accounts over the weekend .
wsj_0417	4	Knight-Ridder would n't comment on the offer .
wsj_0417	5	The company has said the paper is n't for sale , and has rebuffed Mr. McMaster 's earlier requests for access to Free Press financial statements .
wsj_0417	6	In his letter to Knight-Ridder President James K. Batten , Mr. McMaster said he arrived at the $ 68 million figure using Knight-Ridder 's corporate financial statements and comments by Knight-Ridder officials that the Free Press has a $ 50 million value in salvage .
wsj_0417	7	But in an interview , Mr. McMaster said he and his investment banker would need access to full financial records before firming up the offer .
wsj_0418	0	Mitsui & Co. said it started a joint venture with Dae Woong Chemical Co. , a major pharmaceutical manufacturer in South Korea , to manufacture antibiotic medicines .

wsj_0419	0	NRM Energy Co. said it filed materials with the Securities and Exchange Commission calling for it to restructure into a corporation from a limited partnership .
wsj_0419	1	The partnership said it is proposing the change largely because the provisions of its senior notes restrict it from making distributions on its units outstanding .
wsj_0419	2	NRM suspended its common distribution in June 1988 and the distribution on its $ 2 cumulative convertible acquisition preferred units in September .
wsj_0419	3	However , unpaid distributions on the acquisition preferred are cumulative and would total $ 23 million a year , hurting NRM 's financial flexibility and its ability to raise capital , NRM said .
wsj_0419	4	In following several other oil and gas partnerships that have made the conversion to a corporation in the last year , NRM also noted that tax advantages for partnerships have diminished under new tax laws and said it would save $ 2 million a year in administrative costs from the change .
wsj_0419	5	Under the plan , NRM said holders of its common units will receive one share of new common stock in Edisto Resources Corp. for every 14.97 common units owned .
wsj_0419	6	Holders of NRM 's $ 2 cumulative convertible acquisition preferred units will receive one new common share in Edisto for every 1.342 units they own .
wsj_0419	7	After the transaction , current common unitholders will own about 21.3 % of Edisto , current acquisition preferred holders will own 72.3 % , and current stockholders of Edisto will own about 6.4 % , about the same stake as Edisto owns now in NRM .
wsj_0419	8	Edisto currently is the general partner of NRM .
wsj_0419	9	As the largest holder of acquisition preferred units , Mesa Limited Partnership would own about 28 % of Edisto after the transaction .
wsj_0419	10	As part of the transaction , Edisto agreed to give Mesa , an Amarillo , Texas , oil and gas partnership managed by T. Boone Pickens Jr. , a seat on its board .
wsj_0419	11	NRM said its $ 2.60 senior cumulative convertible preferred units will be converted into an equal number of shares of $ 2.60 senior cumulative convertible preferred stock of Edisto .
wsj_0419	12	The transaction is subject to approval of NRM unitholders of record on Oct. 23 , among other conditions .
wsj_0419	13	NRM said it expects unitholders to vote on the restructuring at a meeting Dec. 15 .

wsj_0427	0	A state judge postponed a decision on a move by holders of Telerate Inc. to block the tender offer of Dow Jones & Co. for the 33 % of Telerate it does n't already own .
wsj_0427	1	Vice Chancellor Maurice A. Hartnett III of Delaware 's Court of Chancery heard arguments for more than two hours here , but he made no comment and asked no questions .
wsj_0427	2	He could rule as early as today on the motion seeking a temporary injunction against the Dow Jones offer .
wsj_0427	3	Dow Jones has offered to pay $ 18 a share , or about $ 576 million , for the remaining Telerate stake .
wsj_0427	4	The offer will expire at 5 p.m. EST on Nov. 6 , unless extended again .
wsj_0427	5	Robert Kornreich , an attorney for the Telerate holders , told Judge Hartnett the Dow Jones offer is `` arrogant '' and `` hostile . ''
wsj_0427	6	He accused Dow Jones of `` using unfair means to obtain the stock at an unfair price . ''
wsj_0427	7	Michael Rauch , an attorney for Dow Jones , defended the offer as adequate , based on what the company considers realistic projections of Telerate 's revenue growth , in the range of 12 % .
wsj_0427	8	He also contended that the plaintiffs failed to cite any legal authority that would justify such an injunction .

wsj_0429	0	Lone Star Technologies Inc. said its Lone Star Steel Co. unit sued it in federal court here , seeking to recover an intercompany receivable valued at a minimum of $ 23 million .
wsj_0429	1	The lawsuit was filed by Lone Star Steel 's unsecured creditors ' committee on behalf of Lone Star Steel , which has been operating under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code since June 30 .
wsj_0429	2	Lone Star Technologies said it and its subsidiary 's creditors agree that the parent company owes the unit money , but they have n't been able to reach agreement on the amount .
wsj_0429	3	Judith Elkin , lawyer for the creditors , said the creditors group is challenging certain accounting entries on the parent company 's books and estimates that the receivable owed the steel company could be as much as $ 40 million .
wsj_0429	4	The Lone Star Steel lawsuit also asks the court to rule that Lone Star Technologies is jointly responsible for a $ 4.5 million Lone Star Steel pension payment that was due , but was n't paid , in September and that the parent company ca n't recover the amount from its subsidiary if the parent company makes the payment .
wsj_0429	5	Separately , Lone Star Technologies said the bankruptcy court granted Lone Star Steel an extension until year end on its exclusive period to present a reorganization plan .

wsj_0434	2	Elaborating on the concern about doctors ' sacrificing earnings in order to spend `` talk time '' with patients , we are finding the quality of the time spent is the key to true rapport .

wsj_0434	4	The issue is far-reaching .

wsj_0436	0	Revco D.S. Inc. , the drugstore chain that filed for bankruptcy-court protection last year , received a $ 925 million offer from a group led by Texas billionaire Robert Bass .
wsj_0436	1	Revco reacted cautiously , saying the plan would add $ 260 million of new debt to the highly leveraged company .
wsj_0436	2	It was Revco 's huge debt from its $ 1.3 billion leveraged buy-out in 1986 that forced it to seek protection under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code .
wsj_0436	3	Revco insists that the proposal is simply an `` expression of interest , '' because under Chapter 11 Revco has `` exclusivity rights '' until Feb. 28 .
wsj_0436	4	Those rights prevent anyone other than Revco from proposing a reorganization plan .
wsj_0436	5	Also under Chapter 11 , a reorganization plan is subject to approval by bondholders , banks and other creditors .
wsj_0436	6	A financial adviser for Revco bondholders , David Schulte , of Chilmark Partners , had mixed reactions to the offer .
wsj_0436	7	He said he feared a Revco reorganization might force bondholders to accept a `` cheap deal , '' and that the Bass group 's offer would give them more money .
wsj_0436	8	However , the group is offering to pay off bondholders in cash only -- $ 260.5 million -- and no equity .
wsj_0436	9	The Revco bonds are high-yield , high-risk `` junk '' bonds ; holders have $ 750 million in claims against Revco , Mr. Schulte said .
wsj_0436	10	Revco received the offer Oct. 20 , but issued a response yesterday only after a copy of the proposal was made public by bondholders .
wsj_0436	11	Acadia Partners Limited Partnership , a Fort Worth , Texas , partnership that includes the Robert M. Bass Group , made the proposal .
wsj_0436	12	Mr. Bass is based in Fort Worth .
wsj_0436	13	Analysts said the nation 's second-largest drugstore chain was a valuable company , despite its financial woes .
wsj_0436	14	Its problem , they say , is that management paid too much in the leveraged buy-out and the current $ 515 million debt load is keeping Revco in the red .
wsj_0436	15	`` If bought at the right price , it could still be profitable , '' said Jeffrey Stein , an analyst at McDonald & Co. , Cleveland .
wsj_0436	16	In addition , Revco 's 1,900 stores in 27 states represent a lot of real estate , he said , and demographics are helping pharmacies : The nation 's aging population will boost demand for prescription drugs .
wsj_0436	17	Last week , Revco 's parent company , Anac Holding Corp. , said the company reported a loss of $ 16.2 million for the fiscal first quarter , compared with a loss of $ 27.9 million in the year-earlier quarter .
wsj_0436	18	Sales were $ 597.8 million , up 2.4 % from the previous year .
wsj_0436	19	The company , based in Twinsburg , Ohio , said its operating profit before depreciation and amortization increased 51 % , to $ 9.2 million from $ 6.1 million .
wsj_0436	20	Acadia Partners and the Bass Group declined to comment .
wsj_0436	21	The partnership also includes American Express Co. , Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S. and Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc .
wsj_0436	22	The offer consists of $ 410.5 million in cash and the rest in notes .
wsj_0436	23	Acadia would sell up to 10 % of the equity in the reorganized company to creditors and bondholders in exchange for the cash distribution , but creditors and bondholders would receive no discount for their shares .
wsj_0436	24	Revco 's chairman and chief executive officer , Boake A. Sells , said both the company and the bondholders have put forth reorganization plans , but little progress has been made since negotiations began this summer .
wsj_0436	25	He said he has not met with representatives from Acadia .
wsj_0436	26	Any reorganization proposal , Mr. Sells said , is difficult to assess because it must be agreed upon by the company , bondholders , banks and other creditors .
wsj_0436	27	Revco has $ 1.5 billion in claims outstanding .
wsj_0436	28	`` It 's not like the board can decide '' by itself , Mr. Sells said , adding , `` we 're indifferent to the Bass plan .
wsj_0436	29	We just want a plan that satisfies creditors and at the end leaves a healthy Revco . ''
wsj_0436	30	But Mr. Schulte , the bondholders ' adviser , said Revco was dragging its feet in responding to the proposal .
wsj_0436	31	`` They want to pretend it does n't exist , '' he said .
wsj_0436	32	Mr. Schulte , who met with Acadia representatives on Oct. 10 , said , `` It 's certainly a responsible offer .
wsj_0436	33	It 's not an effort to steal the company '' in the middle of the night .

wsj_0440	0	New construction contracting climbed 8 % in September to an annualized $ 274.2 billion , with commercial , industrial and public-works contracts providing most of the increase , according to F.W. Dodge Group .
wsj_0440	1	Through the first nine months of the year , the unadjusted total of all new construction was $ 199.6 billion , flat compared with a year earlier .
wsj_0440	2	The South was off 2 % after the first nine months , while the North Central region was up 3 % .
wsj_0440	3	The Northeast and West regions were unchanged .
wsj_0440	4	A small decline in total construction for the entire year is possible if contracting for housing does n't increase in response to this year 's lower mortgage rates , said George A. Christie , vice president and chief economist of Dodge , the forecasting division of publisher McGraw-Hill Inc .
wsj_0440	5	The seasonally adjusted Dodge Index reached 175 in September , its highest level this year , from 162 in August .
wsj_0440	6	The index uses a base of 100 in 1982 .
wsj_0440	7	Newly contracted residential work edged up 2 % in September to an annualized $ 121.2 billion , largely because multifamily building rebounded from a very weak August .
wsj_0440	8	`` At the end of the third quarter , there was still no evidence of renewed home building in response to the midyear decline of mortgage rates , '' Mr. Christie said .
wsj_0440	9	Housing has been weak all year and especially so in the past five months .
wsj_0440	10	Contracting for non-residential buildings rose 10 % in September to an annualized $ 100.8 billion .
wsj_0440	11	Commercial and industrial construction rose sharply , partly because of three large projects , each expected to cost more than $ 100 million .
wsj_0440	12	Institutional building , such as hospitals and schools , eased in September following a surge in August .
wsj_0440	13	Although the third quarter was the best so far this year for non-residential building , weakness early in the year held the nine-month total to $ 69.6 billion , up just 1 % from a year earlier .
wsj_0440	14	Public-works and utility projects , also known as non-building contracting , grew 18 % to $ 52.2 billion in September , but the nine-month total of $ 36.9 billion was down 3 % from a year earlier .
wsj_0440	15	The Sept. 30 end of the federal fiscal year may have prodded contractors to get any behind-schedule road and bridge construction under way `` before the clock ran out , '' Mr. Christie said , referring to threatened 5 % across-the-board budget cuts .

wsj_0441	0	Moody 's Investors Service Inc. said it lowered ratings on long-term debt of CS First Boston Inc. , the holding company of Wall Street giant First Boston Corp. , because of First Boston 's `` aggressive merchant banking risk '' in highly leveraged takeovers .
wsj_0441	1	In downgrading CS First Boston 's subordinated domestic , Euromarket and Swiss debt to single-A-3 from single-A-2 , Moody 's is matching a move made by the other major credit rating concern , Standard & Poor 's Corp. , several months ago .
wsj_0441	2	Moody 's also confirmed the Prime-1 rating , its highest , on CS First Boston 's commercial paper , or short-term corporate IOUs .
wsj_0441	3	In addition , Moody 's said it downgraded Financiere Credit Suisse-First Boston 's senior and subordinated Swiss debt to single-A-2 from single-A-1 and lowered Financiere CSFB N.V. 's junior subordinated perpetual Eurodebt , guaranteed by Financiere Credit Suisse -- First Boston , to single-A-3 from single-A-2 .
wsj_0441	4	About $ 550 million of long-term debt is affected , according to Moody 's .
wsj_0441	5	A spokesman for CS First Boston said : `` We remain committed to a full range of businesses , including merchant banking .
wsj_0441	6	We think that the ratings revision is unfortunate but not unexpected .
wsj_0441	7	Our commitment to manage these businesses profitably will continue . ''
wsj_0441	8	First Boston 's merchant banking risks mounted last month as highly leveraged Campeau Corp. , First Boston 's most lucrative client of the decade , was hit by a cash squeeze and the high-risk junk bond market tumbled .
wsj_0441	9	First Boston incurred millions of dollars of losses on Campeau securities it owned as well as on special securities it could n't sell .
wsj_0441	10	First Boston financings for several other highly leveraged clients , including Ohio Mattress , unraveled as the high-risk junk bond market plummeted .
wsj_0441	11	Moody 's said its rating changes actions `` reflect CS First Boston 's aggressive merchant banking risk as well as the risk profile of its current merchant banking exposures . ''
wsj_0441	12	It said CS First Boston `` has consistently been one of the most aggressive firms in merchant banking '' and that `` a very significant portion '' of the firm 's profit in recent years has come from merchant banking-related business .
wsj_0441	13	`` Moody 's believes that the uncertain environment for merchant banking could put pressure on CS First Boston 's performance , '' the rating concern said , citing `` continued problems '' from the firm 's exposures to `` various Campeau-related firms '' and to Ohio Mattress .
wsj_0441	14	`` These two exposures alone represent a very substantial portion of CS First Boston 's equity , '' Moody 's said .
wsj_0441	15	`` Total merchant banking exposures are in excess of the firm 's equity .
wsj_0447	0	On June 30 , a major part of our trade deficit went poof !
wsj_0447	1	No figure juggling ; no witchcraft ; just vastly improved recording of some of our exports .
wsj_0447	2	The Commerce Department found that U.S. exports in 1988 , net of imports , were understated by $ 20.9 billion a year and understated at the annualized rate of $ 25.4 billion in the first quarter of 1989 .
wsj_0447	3	More than half of the `` newly found '' net exports were from just a few service-sector categories .
wsj_0447	4	Some of the biggest service-industry exporters -- American financial-service companies , for example -- have yet to be fully included in our export statistics .
wsj_0447	5	Nearly 10 years ago , representatives of service-sector companies worked out a plan with the Commerce Department to improve the data on service-sector exports .
wsj_0447	6	Both groups believed that tens of billions of dollars of service exports -- such as inbound tourism ; legal , accounting and other professional services furnished to foreigners ; financial , engineering and construction services ; and the like -- were not being counted as exports .
wsj_0447	7	The monthly `` trade deficit '' figure is limited to traditional merchandise trade : manufactured goods and raw materials .
wsj_0447	8	In the quarterly balance-of-payments report , those merchandise trade figures are merged with statistics on exports and imports of services , as well as returns on investments abroad by Americans and returns on foreign investments in the U.S. .
wsj_0447	9	Over time , through benchmark surveys , the corrected data on service exports and imports have been gathered .
wsj_0447	10	The first three major areas of the service sector to be revamped were expenditures by foreign students in the U.S. . net after expenditures by Americans studying abroad , some exports by professional firms a law firm billing a German client for services rendered in watching legislation in Washington is as much an export as shipment of an American jet engine , and improved data from travel and tourism .
wsj_0447	11	In just these three areas , the Commerce Department found $ 23 billion more exports than previously reported and $ 11.6 billion more imports , with the net result that the U.S. service surplus in 1988 increased by $ 11.3 billion , to $ 19 billion .
wsj_0447	12	Combined with recalculations and revisions in other trade areas , the value of U.S. net exports that had not previously been recorded was about $ 20 billion a year .
wsj_0447	13	That means that the U.S. trade deficit was running closer to $ 75 billion than to $ 95 billion in 1988 , and $ 55 billion annualized rather than $ 80 billion in the first quarter of 1989 .
wsj_0447	14	These revised figures also may explain some of the recent strength of the dollar .
wsj_0447	15	The materially smaller trade deficit may have been already discounted in the market .
wsj_0447	16	What does this mean for trade policy ?
wsj_0447	17	Too early to tell , but a trade deficit that is significantly smaller than we imagined does suggest a review of our trade posture .
wsj_0447	18	It does not relieve the need for our market-opening efforts for both goods and services , but it does suggest that it is our exports of services , and not just borrowing , that is financing our imports of goods .

wsj_0448	0	The collapse of a $ 6.79 billion labor-management buy-out of United Airlines parent UAL Corp. may not stop some of Wall Street 's top talent from collecting up to $ 53.7 million in fees .
wsj_0448	1	According to one person familiar with the airline , the buy-out group -- led by United 's pilots union and UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf -- has begun billing UAL for fees and expenses it owes to investment bankers , law firms and banks .
wsj_0448	2	The tab even covers $ 8 million in commitment fees owed to Citicorp and Chase Manhattan Corp. , even though their failure to obtain $ 7.2 billion in bank loans for the buy-out was the main reason for its collapse .
wsj_0448	3	Under a merger agreement reached Sept. 14 , the UAL board agreed to reimburse certain of the buy-out group 's expenses out of company funds even if the transaction was n't completed , provided the group did n't breach the agreement .
wsj_0448	4	The failure to obtain financing does n't by itself constitute a breach .
wsj_0448	5	The merger agreement says the buy-out group is entitled to be repaid $ 26.7 million in fees for its investment bankers , Lazard Freres & Co. and Salomon Brothers Inc. , and its law firm , Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison .
wsj_0448	6	The buy-out group is also entitled to $ 16 million to repay a fund created by the pilots union for an employee stock ownership plan .
wsj_0448	7	In addition to the $ 8 million for Citicorp and Chase , Salomon Brothers is also owed $ 3 million for promising to make a $ 200 million bridge loan .
wsj_0448	8	A spokesman for the buy-out group was n't immediately available for comment .
wsj_0448	9	Separately , UAL stock rose $ 4 a share to $ 175 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange on reports that Los Angeles investor Marvin Davis has asked United Airlines unions if they 're interested in cooperating with Mr. Davis in a new bid for UAL .
wsj_0448	10	But neither the pilots nor the machinists appear interested , and Mr. Davis is barred from making a new bid under terms of an agreement he made with UAL in September unless UAL accepts an offer below $ 300 a share .
wsj_0449	0	Wall Street continued to buckle under the public outcry against computer-driven program trading .
wsj_0449	1	Kidder , Peabody & Co. , a unit of General Electric Co. , announced it would stop doing stock-index arbitrage for its own account , and Merrill Lynch & Co. pulled out of the practice altogether .
wsj_0449	2	At the New York Stock Exchange , which has been buffeted by complaints from angry individual investors and the exchange 's own listed companies , Chairman John J. Phelan Jr. held an emergency meeting with senior partners of some of the Big Board 's 49 stock specialist firms .
wsj_0449	3	The specialists , a trader said , were `` livid '' about Mr. Phelan 's recent remarks that sophisticated computer-driven trading strategies are `` here to stay . ''
wsj_0449	4	Many investors blame program trading for wild swings in the stock market , including the 190-point plunge in the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Oct. 13 .
wsj_0449	5	A specialist is an exchange member designated to maintain a fair and orderly market in a specified stock .
wsj_0449	6	Mr. Phelan 's meeting with the floor brokers comes as he prepares to explain the exchange 's position on program trading to key congressional regulators in a closed session tomorrow , according to exchange officials .
wsj_0449	7	A Big Board spokesman would only say , `` We 're working the problem and looking at the issue and meeting with a broad number of customers and constituents to get their views and ideas on the issue . ''
wsj_0449	8	The program-trading outcry was taken to a new level when giant Contel Corp. said it and 20 or more of the Big Board 's listed companies are forming an unprecedented alliance to complain about the exchange 's role in program trading .
wsj_0449	9	The decision by Merrill , the nation 's largest securities firm , represents the biggest retreat yet from program trading .
wsj_0449	10	Merrill has been the fourth-biggest stock-index arbitrage trader on the Big Board this year , executing an average of 18.1 million shares a month in such trades , or about one million shares a day .
wsj_0449	11	Merrill 's move is one of the most sweeping program-trading pullbacks of recent days , because the big securities firm will no longer execute stock-index arbitrage trades for customers .
wsj_0449	12	Most Wall Street firms , in pulling back , have merely stopped such trading for their own accounts .
wsj_0449	13	Merrill has been one of the main firms executing index arbitrage for customers .
wsj_0449	14	Merrill also said it is lobbying for significant regulatory controls on program trading , including tough margin -- or down-payment -- requirements and limits on price moves for program-driven financial futures .
wsj_0449	15	Merrill , in a statement by Chairman William A. Schreyer and President Daniel P. Tully , said index arbitrage `` has been clearly identified in the investing public 's mind as a contributing factor to excess market volatility , '' so Merrill wo n't execute such trades until `` effective controls '' are in place .
wsj_0449	16	In stock-index arbitrage , traders buy and sell large amounts of stocks with offsetting trades in stock-index futures and options .
wsj_0449	17	The idea is to lock in profits from short-term swings in volatile markets .
wsj_0449	18	Last Thursday , PaineWebber Group Inc. also said it would cease index arbitrage altogether , but the firm was n't as big an index arbitrager as Merrill is .
wsj_0449	19	Other large firms , including Bear , Stearns & Co. and Morgan Stanley & Co. , last week announced a pullback from index arbitrage , but only for the firms ' own accounts .
wsj_0449	20	Kidder made an abrupt about-face on program trading yesterday , after a special meeting between the firm 's president and chief executive officer , Michael Carpenter , and its senior managers .
wsj_0449	21	Just a week ago , Mr. Carpenter staunchly defended index arbitrage at Kidder , the most active index-arbitrage trading firm on the stock exchange this year .
wsj_0449	22	Index arbitrage , Mr. Carpenter said last week , does n't have a `` negative impact on the market as a whole '' and Kidder 's customers were `` sophisticated '' enough to know that .
wsj_0449	23	But yesterday , Mr. Carpenter said big institutional investors , which he would n't identify , `` told us they would n't do business with firms '' that continued to do index arbitrage for their own accounts .
wsj_0449	24	`` We were following the trend of our competitors who were under pressure from institutions , '' he said .
wsj_0449	25	Kidder so far this year has executed a monthly average of 37.8 million shares in index-arbitrage trading , and is second only to Morgan Stanley in overall program trading , which includes index arbitrage .
wsj_0449	26	Most of Kidder 's program trading is for its own account , according to the New York Stock Exchange .
wsj_0449	27	Kidder denied that GE 's chairman and chief executive , John F. Welch , had anything to do with Kidder 's decision .
wsj_0449	28	But at least one chief executive said he called Mr. Welch to complain about Kidder 's aggressive use of program trading , and other market sources said they understood that Mr. Welch received many phone calls complaining about Kidder 's reliance on index arbitrage as a major business .
wsj_0449	29	Kidder has generally been sensitive to suggestions that GE makes decisions for its Kidder unit .
wsj_0449	30	`` Our decision had nothing to do with any pressure Mr. Welch received , '' Mr. Carpenter said .
wsj_0449	31	`` This was a Kidder Peabody stand-alone decision . ''
wsj_0449	32	A spokeswoman for GE in Fairfield , Conn. , said , `` Absolutely no one spoke to Jack Welch on this subject '' and added , `` Anyone who claims they talked to Jack Welch is n't telling the truth . ''
wsj_0449	33	Supporters of index arbitrage have n't been publicly sticking up for the trading strategy , as some did during the post-crash outcry of 1987 .
wsj_0449	34	But Merrill Lynch , in its statement about pulling out of index arbitrage , suggested that the current debate has missed the mark .
wsj_0449	35	Merrill said it continues to believe that `` the causes of excess market volatility are far more complex than any particular computer trading strategy .
wsj_0449	36	Indeed , there are legitimate hedging strategies used by managers of large portfolios such as pension funds that involve program trading as a means of protecting the assets of their pension beneficiaries . ''
wsj_0449	37	Merrill 's index arbitragers will continue to do other kinds of computer-assisted program trading , so there probably wo n't be any layoffs at the firm , people familiar with Merrill 's program operation said .
wsj_0449	38	Meanwhile , Bear Stearns Chairman and Chief Executive Alan C. Greenberg said his firm will continue stock-index arbitrage for its clients .
wsj_0449	39	At the firm 's annual meeting last night , he told shareholders that index arbitrage wo n't go away , despite the public outcry .
wsj_0449	40	`` If they think they are going to stop index arbitrage by causing a few Wall Street firms to quit , they are crazy , '' Mr. Greenberg said .
wsj_0449	41	`` It 's not going to stop it at all . ''
wsj_0449	42	Mr. Greenberg , noting that stock-index arbitrage rises and ebbs with stock market 's volatility , said that for the first four months of the firm 's fiscal year beginning in July , stock-index arbitrage had been a `` break-even '' proposition for Bear Stearns .
wsj_0449	43	In response to a shareholder 's suggestion , Mr. Greenberg agreed that European firms will simply pick up the index-arbitrage business left behind by U.S. institutions .
wsj_0449	44	Pressure from big institutional investors has been the major catalyst for Wall Street 's program-trading pullback .
wsj_0449	45	And there was speculation yesterday that Fidelity Investments and other large mutual-fund companies might soon follow the lead of Kemper Corp. and other institutions in cutting off trading business to securities firms that do program trading .
wsj_0449	46	A Fidelity spokesman in Boston denied the speculation , saying the program-trading issue was more of a regulatory problem .
wsj_0449	47	But a much smaller mutual fund company , the USAA Investment Management Co. unit of USAA , San Antonio , Texas , said it informed nine national brokerage firms it will cease business with them unless they stop index-arbitrage trading .
wsj_0449	48	USAA , with 400,000 mutual fund accounts , manages more than $ 10 billion , $ 2 billion of which is in the stock market .
wsj_0449	49	Michael J.C. Roth , USAA executive vice president , called program trading `` mindless . ''
wsj_0449	50	He said there is `` no valid investment reason '' for stock-index futures to exist .
wsj_0449	51	A program-bashing move is clearly on .
wsj_0449	52	Charles Wohlstetter , chairman of Contel , who is helping organize the alliance of Big Board-listed firms , said he had no time to work yesterday because he received so many phone calls , faxes and letters supporting his view that the Big Board has been turned into a `` gambling casino '' by program traders .
wsj_0449	53	`` We are reaching the moment of truth '' on Wall Street , said Rep. Edward J. Markey D. , Mass. , chairman of the House subcommittee on telecommunications and finance .
wsj_0449	54	`` Wall Street is beginning to realize -- as Shakespeare said -- the trouble is not in our stars , but in ourselves . ''

wsj_0450	0	An ancient red-figured Greek kylix , or drinking cup , ) was recovered backstage at Sotheby 's this spring and has been returned to the Manhattan couple who lost it in a burglary three years ago .
wsj_0450	1	Robert Guy , an associate curator at the Princeton Art Museum , was previewing a June antiquities sale at the auction house when he recognized the kylix , which he , as a specialist in Attic pottery and a careful reader of the Stolen Art Alert in `` IFAR Reports , '' knew was stolen .
wsj_0450	2	The timing of his visit was fortuitous ; the man who had brought it in for an estimate had returned to collect it and was waiting in the hall .
wsj_0450	3	To confirm Mr. Guy 's identification , Sotheby 's and IFAR exchanged photos by fax , and the waiting man , apparently innocent of knowledge that the kylix was stolen , agreed to release it .
wsj_0450	4	The cup had been insured , and in short order it was given over to a Chubb & Son representative .
wsj_0450	5	The original owners happily repaid the claim and took their kylix home .
wsj_0450	6	A former curator of the Museum of Cartoon Art in Rye Brook , N.Y. , pleaded guilty in July to stealing and selling original signed and dated comic strips , among them 29 Dick Tracy strips by Chester Gould , 77 Prince Valiant Sunday cartoons by Hal Foster , and a dozen Walt Disney animation celluloids , according to Barbara Hammond , the museum 's director .
wsj_0450	7	He sold them well below market value to raise cash `` to pay off mounting credit-card debts , '' incurred to buy presents for his girlfriend , his attorney , Philip Russell , told IFAR .
wsj_0450	8	The curator , 27-year-old Sherman Krisher of Greenwich , Conn. , had worked his way up from janitor in seven years at the museum .
wsj_0450	9	The theft was discovered early this year , soon after Ms. Hammond took her post .
wsj_0450	10	Sentencing was postponed on Aug. 18 , when Mr. Krisher was hospitalized for depression .
wsj_0450	11	His efforts to get back the stolen strips had resulted in recovery of just three .
wsj_0450	12	But on Oct. 6 , he had reason to celebrate .
wsj_0450	13	Two days earlier , his attorney met in a Park Avenue law office with a cartoon dealer who expected to sell 44 of the most important stolen strips to Mr. Russell for $ 62,800 .
wsj_0450	14	Instead , New York City police seized the stolen goods , and Mr. Krisher avoided jail .
wsj_0450	15	He was sentenced to 500 hours of community service and restitution to the museum of $ 45,000 .
wsj_0450	16	Authorities at London 's Heathrow Airport are investigating the disappearance of a Paul Gauguin watercolor , `` Young Tahitian Woman in a Red Pareo , '' that has two sketches on its verso opposite side .
wsj_0450	17	Valued at $ 1.3 million , it was part of a four-crate shipment .
wsj_0450	18	The air-waybill number was changed en route , and paper work showing that the crates had cleared customs was misplaced , so it was a week before three of the four crates could be located in a bonded warehouse and the Gauguin discovered missing .
wsj_0450	19	Although Heathrow authorities have been watching a group of allegedly crooked baggage handlers for some time , the Gauguin may be `` lost . ''
wsj_0450	20	Chief Inspector Peter Seacomb of the Criminal Investigation Department at the airport said , `` It is not uncommon for property to be temporarily mislaid or misrouted . ''
wsj_0450	21	Officials at the University of Virginia Art Museum certainly would agree .
wsj_0450	22	Their museum had purchased an Attic black-figured column krater and shipped it from London .
wsj_0450	23	It was reported stolen in transit en route to Washington , D.C. , in February .
wsj_0450	24	Months later , the Greek vase arrived in good condition at the museum in Charlottesville , having inexplicably traveled by a circuitous route through Nairobi .
wsj_0450	25	Two Mexican college dropouts , not professional art thieves , have been arrested for a 1985 Christmas Eve burglary from the National Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City .
wsj_0450	26	About 140 Mayan , Aztec , Mixtec and Zapotec objects , including some of Mexico 's best-known archaeological treasures , were taken .
wsj_0450	27	The government offered a reward for the return of the antiquities , but routine police work led to the recovery .
wsj_0450	28	As it turned out , Carlos Perches Trevino and Ramon Sardina Garcia had hidden the haul in a closet in the Perches family 's home for a year .
wsj_0450	29	Then they took the art to Acapulco and began to trade some of it for cocaine .
wsj_0450	30	Information from an arrested drug trafficker led to the two men and the recovery of almost all the stolen art .
wsj_0450	31	Among other happy news bulletins from the German Democratic Republic , the Leipzig Museum of Fine Arts announced that it has recovered `` Cemetery in the Snow , '' a painting by the German Romantic painter Caspar David Friedrich .
wsj_0450	32	The artist 's melancholy subjects bring high prices on the world market , and the U.S. State Department notified IFAR of the theft in February 1988 .
wsj_0450	33	According to a source at the East Europe desk , two previously convicted felons were charged , tried , convicted and sentenced to prison terms of four and 12 years .
wsj_0450	34	The precious canvas , cut from its frame at the time of the theft , was found in nearby Jena , hidden in the upholstery of an easy chair in the home of the girlfriend of one of the thieves .
wsj_0450	35	No charges were brought against her .
wsj_0450	36	Trompe l'oeil painting is meant to fool the eye , but Robert Lawrence Trotter , 35 , of Kennett Square , Pa. , took his fooling seriously .
wsj_0450	37	He painted one himself in the style of John Haberle and sold it as a 19th-century original to antique dealers in Woodbridge , Conn .
wsj_0450	38	Mr. Trotter 's painting showed a wall of wood boards with painted ribbons tacked down in a rectangle ; tucked behind the ribbons were envelopes , folded , faded and crumpled papers and currency .
wsj_0450	39	Mr. Trotter 's fake Haberle was offered at a bargain price of $ 25,000 with a phony story that it belonged to his wife 's late aunt in New Canaan , Conn .
wsj_0450	40	The dealers immediately showed their new acquisition to an expert and came to see it as a fake .
wsj_0450	41	They persuaded Mr. Trotter to take it back and , with the help of the FBI , taped their conversation with him .
wsj_0450	42	After his arrest , the forger admitted to faking and selling other paintings up and down the Eastern seaboard .

wsj_0451	0	Ford Motor Co. said it is recalling about 3,600 of its 1990-model Escorts because the windshield adhesive was improperly applied to some cars .
wsj_0451	1	Separately , Ford and Mazda Motor Corp. 's U.S. sales arm said they are recalling about 88,500 1988-model Mercury Tracers and 220,000 1986 , 1987 and 1988 model Mazda 323s equipped with 1.6-liter fuel-injected engines to replace the oil filler cap .
wsj_0451	2	Mazda makes the Tracer for Ford .
wsj_0451	3	As a result of the adhesive problem on the Ford Escort subcompacts , windshields may easily separate from the car during frontal impact , the U.S. auto maker said .
wsj_0451	4	When properly applied , the adhesive is designed to retain the windshield in place in a crash test at 30 miles per hour .
wsj_0451	5	A Ford spokesman said the Dearborn , Mich. , auto maker is n't aware of any injuries caused by the windshield problem .
wsj_0451	6	Ford said owners should return the cars to dealers so the windshields can be removed and securely reinstalled .
wsj_0451	7	Mazda and Ford said a combination of limited crankcase ventilation and improper maintenance could cause engine oil in some of the Mercury Tracers and Mazda 323s to deteriorate more rapidly than normal , causing increased engine noise or reduced engine life .
wsj_0451	8	They said the problems are n't safety related .
wsj_0451	9	Both companies will replace the oil filler cap with a ventilated oil filler cap .
wsj_0451	10	Both also will inspect and replace , if necessary , oil filters and oil strainers , at no charge to owners .
wsj_0451	11	For owners who have followed the recommended oil maintenance schedule , Mazda will extend to five years or 60,000 miles the warranty term for engine damage due to abnormal engine oil deterioration .
wsj_0451	12	The normal term for the 1986 and 1987 model 323 is two years or 24,000 miles ; the term for the 1988 323 is three years or 50,000 miles .
wsj_0451	13	Ford said the term on its warranty is already six years or 60,000 miles .
wsj_0451	14	Separately , Ford said it will offer $ 750 cash rebates to buyers of its 1990-model Ford Bronco sport utility vehicle .
wsj_0451	15	It said it will also offer buyers the option of financing as low as 6.9 % on 24-month loans .
wsj_0451	16	Ford also offered the low financing rate option on 1989-model Broncos , which previously carried a $ 750 cash discount .
wsj_0451	17	Ford said the new offer will begin Saturday and run indefinitely .
wsj_0452	0	The Supreme Court agreed to decide whether the federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. may require LTV Corp. to reassume funding responsibility for a $ 2.3 billion shortfall in the company 's pension plans .
wsj_0452	1	The high court 's decision , expected next spring , may affect the stability of many large corporate pension plans that have relied on the availability of pension insurance provided by the federal pension regulatory and insurance agency .
wsj_0452	2	The agency , which is funded through insurance premiums from employers , insures pension benefits for some 30 million private-sector workers who take part in single-employer pension plans .
wsj_0452	3	It recently reported assets of $ 2.4 billion and liabilities of $ 4 billion .
wsj_0452	4	In its appeal to the high court , the agency said the federal appeals court ruling , which favored LTV , threatened to transform the agency from an insurer of troubled pension plans into an `` open-ended source of industry bailouts . ''
wsj_0452	5	The ruling also may determine how quickly LTV is able to complete its Chapter 11 reorganization .
wsj_0452	6	LTV filed for protection under Chapter 11 in federal bankruptcy court in 1986 .
wsj_0452	7	The filing was partly the result of the $ 2.3 billion shortfall in LTV 's three pension plans operated for its LTV Steel Co. subsidiary 's employees .
wsj_0452	8	In January 1987 , as LTV Steel continued operating while under reorganization , the agency terminated the three LTV pension plans to keep its insurance liability from increasing .
wsj_0452	9	Termination means that the agency 's insurance assumes the liabilities and pays the pension benefits already owed under the plans , but workers do n't accrue new benefits .
wsj_0452	10	A few months later , under pressure from the United Steelworkers of America , LTV instituted a new program to provide retirement benefits similar to those in the terminated plans .
wsj_0452	11	Because the federal pension agency had taken over the old plans , LTV would be responsible only for benefits paid under the new pension plans .
wsj_0452	12	But the agency viewed the creation of the new plans as an abuse of federal pension law and an attempt to transfer the liability of the $ 2.3 billion shortfall from LTV to federal insurance .
wsj_0452	13	The agency also concluded that LTV 's financial status had improved while it was under reorganization .
wsj_0452	14	In September 1987 , it ordered LTV to reassume liability and funding for the three original plans .
wsj_0452	15	LTV challenged the order , and a federal district court in New York in June 1988 ruled that the agency improperly ordered LTV to reassume responsibility for the plans .
wsj_0452	16	In May , a federal appeals court in New York agreed that the agency acted unlawfully .
wsj_0452	17	The appeals court said there was no evidence that Congress intended to allow the pension agency to consider a company 's creation of new benefit plans as a basis for ordering that company to reassume liability for old plans .
wsj_0452	18	The appeals court also said the agency had to consider a company 's long-term ability to fund pension plans , not just short-term improved financial status .
wsj_0452	19	In Dallas , LTV said that it was disappointed that the court agreed to hear the case because it believes the move will further delay its Chapter 11 proceedings .
wsj_0452	20	The company has n't been able to come up with a reorganization plan , in part , because of the sizable disagreement with the pension agency .
wsj_0452	21	But LTV , a steel , aerospace and energy concern , said it is confident that the Supreme Court will uphold the lower-court decisions and said it expects to continue discussions with the agency about a settlement while the case is being reviewed .

wsj_0455	0	The Supreme Court let stand a New York court 's ruling that the manufacturers of a drug once used to prevent miscarriages must share liability for injuries or deaths when the maker of an individual dose is unknown .
wsj_0455	1	The high court 's action , refusing to hear appeals by several drug companies , is likely to have a significant impact at several levels .
wsj_0455	2	The most immediate effect is in New York , where former manufacturers of the anti-miscarriage drug DES -- the synthetic female hormone diethylstilbestrol -- face the prospect of shared liability for damages in many of the 700 to 1,000 DES lawsuits pending in that state .
wsj_0455	3	The lawsuits stemmed from the development of cancer and other problems in the daughters of women who took the drug .
wsj_0455	4	On a broader scale , the ruling could encourage other states ' courts to adopt the logic of the New York court , not only in DES cases but in other product-related lawsuits , as well .
wsj_0455	5	The New York Court of Appeals ruling parallels a 1980 decision by the California Supreme Court requiring shared liability among manufacturers for injuries when it ca n't be determined which company is at fault .
wsj_0455	6	Paul Rheingold , a New York lawyer who represents DES victims , said that before the New York ruling , only the states of Washington and Wisconsin had followed the California decision .
wsj_0455	7	Now that the New York decision has been left intact , other states may follow suit .
wsj_0455	8	`` Generally , when New York and California go one way , it has a tremendous influence on other states , especially small ones , '' said Mr. Rheingold .
wsj_0455	9	The high court refused to hear appeals by Rexall Drug Co. , which went out of business in 1987 and was taken over by RXDC Liquidating Trust ; E.R. Squibb & Sons Inc. , a unit of Squibb Corp. ; and Eli Lilly & Co .
wsj_0455	10	The appeals involved DES , which was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use from the 1940s until 1971 to prevent miscarriages during pregnancy .
wsj_0455	11	In 1971 , the FDA banned the use of DES after studies linked it to cancer and other problems in daughters of women who took the drug .
wsj_0455	12	Lawsuits over the harm caused by DES have flooded federal and state courts in the past decade .
wsj_0455	13	In many cases , the lawsuit was filed long after the drug was used -- the cancer in the daughters was typically not detected for years -- and there is no way to prove which of several companies manufactured the doses consumed by certain women .
wsj_0455	14	Under traditional legal theories , inability to prove which company manufactured a drug that caused an injury or death would lead to the lawsuit being dismissed .
wsj_0455	15	But in its ruling last April , the New York court said that all producers of the anti-miscarriage drug should share liability when the manufacturer of a specific dose ca n't be determined .
wsj_0455	16	Each company 's share of liability would be based on their share of the national DES market .
wsj_0455	17	The New York court also upheld a state law , passed in 1986 , extending for one year the statute of limitations on filing DES lawsuits .
wsj_0455	18	The effect is that lawsuits that might have been barred because they were filed too late could proceed because of the one-year extension .

wsj_0455	20	The high court , leaving intact a $ 4.25 million damage award against General Dynamics Corp. , declined to resolve questions about a legal defense against civil lawsuits often used by government contractors .
wsj_0455	21	Last year , the Supreme Court defined when companies , such as military contractors , may defend themselves against lawsuits for deaths or injuries by asserting that they were simply following specifications of a federal government contract .
wsj_0455	22	In that decision , the high court said a company must prove that the government approved precise specifications for the contract , that those specifications were met and that the government was warned of any dangers in use of the equipment .
wsj_0455	23	But last February , a federal appeals court in New Orleans upheld a damage award against General Dynamics , rejecting the company 's use of the government contractor defense .
wsj_0455	24	The appeals court said the defense is valid only if federal officials did more than rubber stamp a company 's design or plans and engaged in a `` substantive review and evaluation '' on a par with a policy decision .
wsj_0455	25	General Dynamics appealed to the high court , backed by numerous business trade groups , arguing that the appeals court definition restricts the defense too severely .
wsj_0455	26	General Dynamics was sued by the families of five Navy divers who were killed in 1982 after they re-entered a submarine through a diving chamber .
wsj_0455	27	The accident was caused by faulty operation of a valve .
wsj_0455	28	A federal district court awarded damages to the families and the appeals court affirmed the award .

wsj_0458	0	Oh , that terrible Mr. Ortega .
wsj_0458	1	Just when American liberalism had pulled the arms plug on the Contras and their friend Ronald Reagan , along comes Mr. Ortega in Costa Rica this weekend to `` blunder '' into the hands of what are often called conservatives .
wsj_0458	2	Conservatives are the faction in U.S. politics which always said that Mr. Ortega and his friends do n't want to hold an election in Nicaragua .
wsj_0458	3	Liberals are the faction that says , Give peace a chance ; now they are saying Mr. Ortega should give them a break , lest the conservatives ask them to vote for bullets instead of bandages .

wsj_0458	5	He knows that making George Bush look silly in a photograph with him will trigger Noriegan fulminations , and that announcing an end to the liberals ' cease-fire will produce mainly their concern over the Contras ' military activities in northern Nicaragua .

wsj_0461	0	The Treasury Department proposed that banks be required to keep detailed records of international wire transfers , which officials believe is the main vehicle used by drug traffickers to move billions of dollars in and out of the U.S. .
wsj_0461	1	In recent testimony on Capitol Hill , Treasury officials said they were considering the new reporting requirements , and the expected publication of the proposal in the Federal Register today is the first official step toward creating final regulations .
wsj_0461	2	The Treasury is still working out the details with bank trade associations and the other government agencies that have a hand in fighting money laundering .
wsj_0461	3	Among the possibilities the Treasury is considering are requirements that banks keep records identifying the originators and recipients of international wire transfers .
wsj_0461	4	Another suggestion would draw banks more directly into tracking down money launderers by developing a `` suspicious international wire transfer profile , '' which banks would use to spotlight questionable payments .
wsj_0461	5	But banks may prefer using a profile that targets selected transactions , rather than a blanket reporting requirement .
wsj_0461	6	Banks now are required only to report cash deposits or withdrawals of $ 10,000 or more .
wsj_0461	7	But wire transfers from a standing account -- including those bigger than $ 10,000 -- are n't reported .

wsj_0462	0	Western Union Corp. took steps to withdraw its proposed debt swap for $ 500 million in high-interest notes and said it is looking at other alternatives for refinancing the debt .
wsj_0462	1	Western Union had said two weeks ago that it might withdraw the pending offer , which would have replaced $ 500 million in so-called reset notes , now paying 19.25 % annual interest and set to come due in 1992 , with two new issues paying lower interest .
wsj_0462	2	Yesterday the company said it had filed a request with the Securities and Exchange Commission to withdraw the registration statement regarding the proposed swap .
wsj_0462	3	A Western Union spokesman , citing adverse developments in the market for high-yield `` junk '' bonds , declined to say what alternatives are under consideration .
wsj_0462	4	But some holders of the Western Union notes expect the company to propose a more-attractive debt swap that will give them a substantial equity stake in the company .
wsj_0462	5	Western Union has had major losses in recent years as its telex business has faltered in the face of competition from facsimile machines and as other business ventures have gone awry .
wsj_0462	6	The major question , said one holder who asked not to be named , is whether New York investor Bennett S. LeBow , whose Brooke Partners controls Western Union , is willing to offer a large enough equity stake to entice bondholders into agreeing to a new swap .
wsj_0462	7	The $ 500 million in notes , the largest chunk of Western Union 's $ 640 million in long-term debt , stems from the company 's major restructuring in December 1987 .
wsj_0462	8	The notes became burdensome when reset provisions allowed their interest rate to be raised to 19.25 % last June .
wsj_0462	9	Western Union had offered to swap each $ 1,000 face amount of the notes for six shares of common stock and two new debt issues : a $ 500 note paying an interest rate starting at 16.75 % annually and rising in later years , due in 1992 , and a $ 500 note , due in 1997 , paying a fixed rate of 17 % and including rights protecting a holder against a decline in the trading price of the bond .
wsj_0462	10	Western Union must make $ 48 million in interest payments on the reset notes on Dec. 15 , and a company spokesman said it fully intends to meet the payments .
wsj_0462	11	But Western Union has said it must lower the interest rate on its debt to regain full financial health .
wsj_0463	0	Genentech Inc. said the West German distributor of its heart drug TPA reached a joint marketing agreement with a subsidiary of Hoechst AG , which makes the rival anti-clotting agent streptokinase .
wsj_0463	1	The biotechnology concern said the agreement between its longtime West German distributor , Boehringer-Ingleheim 's Dr. Karl Thomae G.m.b.H. subsidiary , and Hoechst 's Behringwerke subsidiary was an attempt to expand the market for blood-clot drugs in general .
wsj_0463	2	A Genentech spokeswoman said the agreement calls for Hoechst to promote TPA for heart patients and streptokinase for other clot-reducing purposes .
wsj_0466	0	Many investors give Michael Foods about as much chance of getting it together as Humpty Dumpty .
wsj_0466	1	But now at least there 's a glimmer of hope for the stock .
wsj_0466	2	Burger King , which breaks thousands of fresh eggs each morning , is quietly switching over to an alternative egg product made by Michael Foods .
wsj_0466	3	Known as Easy Eggs , the product has disappointed investors .
wsj_0466	4	When the company this month announced lower-than-forecast sales of Easy Eggs , the stock dropped nearly 19 % .
wsj_0466	5	Michael wo n't confirm the identities of any Easy Egg customers , nor will it say much of anything else .
wsj_0466	6	Two Minneapolis shareholder suits in the past month have accused top officers of making `` various untrue statements . ''
wsj_0466	7	These federal-court suits accuse the officers of failing to disclose that Easy Eggs were unlikely to sell briskly enough to justify all of Michael 's production capacity .
wsj_0466	8	But at least Burger King has signed on , and says that by year end it wo n't be using any shell eggs .
wsj_0466	9	The Miami fast-food chain , owned by Grand Metropolitan of Britain , expects to consume roughly 34 million pounds of liquefied eggs annually .
wsj_0466	10	So there is reason to believe that Michael 's hopes for a bacteria-free , long-shelf-life egg were n't all hype .
wsj_0466	11	Easy Eggs are pasteurized in a heat-using process . )
wsj_0466	12	Still , caution is advisable .
wsj_0466	13	A company official says Michael 's break-even volume on Easy Eggs is around 60 million pounds a year -- apparently well above current shipments and a far cry from what the company once suggested was a billion-pound market waiting for such a product .
wsj_0466	14	Perhaps to debunk the analysts ' talk of over-capacity , Michael today will take some of the skeptics on a tour of its new Gaylord , Minn. , plant .
wsj_0466	15	There has been no announcement of the Burger King arrangement by either party , possibly for fear that McDonald 's and other fast-food rivals would seize on it in scornful advertising .
wsj_0466	16	But Burger King operators independently confirm using Michael 's product .
wsj_0466	17	Other institutional users reportedly include Marriott , which is moving away from fresh eggs on a region-by-region basis .
wsj_0466	18	The extent of Marriott 's use is n't known , and Marriott officials could n't be reached for comment .
wsj_0466	19	Michael Foods has attracted a good many short-sellers , the people who sell borrowed shares in a bet that a stock price will drop and allow the return of cheaper shares to the lender .
wsj_0466	20	Many analysts question management 's credibility .
wsj_0466	21	`` The stock , in my opinion , is going to go lower , not only because of disappointing earnings but because the credibility gap is certainly not closing , '' says L. Craig Carver of Dain Bosworth .
wsj_0466	22	Mr. Carver says that at a recent Dain-sponsored conference in New York , he asked Michael 's chief executive officer if the fourth quarter would be down .
wsj_0466	23	The CEO , Richard G. Olson , replied `` yes , '' but would n't elaborate .
wsj_0466	24	The company did n't put out a public announcement .
wsj_0466	25	A spokesman said later that Mr. Olson was being `` conservative '' in his estimate .
wsj_0466	26	But the spokesman added that while Michael will earn less than last year 's $ 1.20 a share , it thinks Street estimates of $ 1 or so are low . )
wsj_0466	27	Analyst Robin Young of John Kinnard & Co. , Minneapolis , calls himself `` the last remaining bull on the stock . ''
wsj_0466	28	He argues that Michael Foods is misunderstood : `` This is a growth company in the packaged food industry -- a rare breed , like finding a white rhino . ''
wsj_0466	29	Earnings are n't keeping pace , he says , because of heavy investments in the egg technologies and drought-related costs in its potato business .
wsj_0466	30	Mr. Carver , however , believes the company 's egg product wo n't help the bottom line in the short run , even though it `` makes sense -- it 's more convenient '' and justifies its price , which is higher than shell eggs , because of health and sanitation concerns .
wsj_0466	31	Prospective competition is one problem .
wsj_0466	32	Last week a closely held New Jersey concern , Papetti High-Grade Egg Products Co. , rolled out an aseptically packaged liquefied item called Table Ready .
wsj_0466	33	Company President Steve Papetti says Marriott will be among his clients as well .
wsj_0466	34	Michael shares closed at 13 3/4 yesterday in national over-the-counter trading .
wsj_0466	35	Says New York-based short seller Mark Cohodes , `` In my mind this is a $ 7 stock . ''
wsj_0466	36	Michael late yesterday announced a $ 3.8 million stock buy-back program .
wsj_0466	37	Michael , which also processes potatoes , still relies on spuds for about a fourth of its sales and nearly half its pretax profit .
wsj_0466	38	But dry growing conditions in the Red River Valley of Minnesota and North Dakota are pushing spot prices of potatoes beyond what Michael contracted to pay last spring .
wsj_0466	39	Company lawyers recently sent letters to growers saying that Michael `` would take very seriously any effort ... to divert its contracted-for potatoes to other outlets . ''
wsj_0466	40	Still , analysts believe that profit margins in the potato business will be down again this year .
wsj_0468	0	G.D. Searle & Co. said the Food and Drug Administration approved the sale of Kerlone , a hypertension drug developed by a joint venture between Searle and a French concern .
wsj_0468	1	Searle , a unit of Monsanto Co. , said the `` beta-blocker '' high-blood-pressure drug Kerlone is the first product to reach the market through Lorex Pharmaceuticals , the U.S. company jointly owned by Searle and Synthelabo , a French pharmaceutical concern owned by France 's L'Oreal S.A .
wsj_0470	0	Warner Communications Inc. and Sony Corp. resumed settlement talks on their legal battle over Hollywood producers Peter Guber and Jon Peters , but continued to level strong accusations at each other in legal documents .
wsj_0470	1	Warner has filed a $ 1 billion breach of contract suit in Los Angeles Superior Court against Sony and the Guber-Peters duo , who in turn are countersuing Warner for trying to interfere in Sony 's acquisition of Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. and Guber Peters Entertainment Co. in two transactions valued at over $ 5 billion .
wsj_0470	2	Although settlement talks had been dropped , attorneys for the two sides apparently began talking again yesterday in an attempt to settle the matter before Thursday , when a judge is expected to rule on Warner 's request for an injunction that would block the two producers from taking over the management of Columbia .
wsj_0470	3	Yesterday , in documents filed in connection with that case , Warner accused Sony officials of falsely claiming that they never read the five-year contract requiring the two producers to make movies exclusively for Columbia , citing Securities and Exchange Commission filings made by Sony that described the contracts .
wsj_0470	4	Warner was referring to documents filed last week in which Sony Corp. of America Vice Chairman Michael Schulof and Walter Yetnikoff , president of its CBS Records unit , said they had taken Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters at their word when the producers told them that getting out of the contract would be no problem because of a previous oral agreement .
wsj_0470	5	Wayne Smith , an attorney at Gibson , Dunn & Crutcher in Los Angeles representing Sony , said the Sony executives had n't seen the contract because `` it was n't relevant once Guber and Peters told them Warner would let them terminate it at any time . ''
wsj_0470	6	Mr. Smith said statements about the contract made in SEC filings were made by attorneys who did have access to the contracts but who were n't part of the negotiations between Sony and the duo .
wsj_0470	7	Warner executives also filed new sworn affidavits denying claims by Messrs. Guber and Peters that the two sides had an oral agreement that enabled the producers to terminate their contract with Warner should the opportunity to run a major studio come up .
wsj_0470	8	But Mr. Smith said Sony intends to prove that the oral agreement did in fact exist , and that even the existing written contract does n't preclude the producers from taking executive posts at another studio .
wsj_0470	9	Warner described as `` nonsense '' yesterday Sony 's assertions in prior court filings that Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters could in theory run Columbia while still fulfilling their contract to produce movies for Warner .
wsj_0470	10	Such a dual role would be `` impractical and unethical , '' Warner said , adding , `` that concept is as silly as suggesting that the head coach of the Los Angeles Dodgers could simultaneously be general manager of the San Francisco Giants . ''
wsj_0470	11	Warner , which is in the process of being acquired by New York-based Time Warner Inc. , also said it paid the two producers a fixed annual salary of $ 3 million .
wsj_0471	0	Dataproducts Inc. said it filed a lawsuit in Delaware Chancery Court to block a tender offer by DPC Acquisition Partners , alleging that the hostile offer violates a standstill agreement between the two concerns .
wsj_0471	1	DPC , an investor group led by New York-based Crescott Investment Associates , had itself filed a suit in state court in Los Angeles seeking to nullify the agreement .

wsj_0471	3	DPC last week launched a new , $ 10-a-share offer for the Woodland Hills , Calif.-based computer printer maker .

wsj_0473	0	Foothills Pipe Lines Ltd. filed an application with Canadian regulators to build a 4.4 billion Canadian dollar US$ 3.74 billion pipeline to transport natural gas from Canada 's Arctic to U.S. markets beginning in
wsj_0473	1	The application by Foothills , owned by Calgary-based Nova Corp. of Alberta and Westcoast Energy Inc. of Vancouver , Canada , is expected to kick off what could be a contentious battle for the right to transport vast quantities of gas to southern markets from still-undeveloped fields in Canada 's Mackenzie River delta .
wsj_0473	2	`` This is a pre-emptive strike by Foothills , '' said Rick Hillary , natural gas manager of the Calgary-based Independent Petroleum Association of Canada , an industry group .
wsj_0473	3	`` Foothills wants to make it clear to other pipeline companies that it 's on first insofar as transporting gas from the Arctic to southern markets , '' Mr. Hillary said .
wsj_0473	4	At least two rival applications are expected to emerge in coming months , including one from TransCanada PipeLines Ltd. , Canada 's largest natural gas pipeline operator .
wsj_0473	5	Another is expected from a consortium of oil and gas producers who won conditional approval this month from Canada 's National Energy Board to export about 9.2 trillion cubic feet of Mackenzie delta gas to the U.S. starting in 1996 .
wsj_0473	6	The producers include Shell Canada Ltd. , a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group ; Esso Resources Canada Ltd. , a unit of Imperial Oil Ltd. , which is 71%-owned by Exxon Corp. ; and Gulf Canada Resources Ltd. , a unit of Olympia & York Developments Ltd .
wsj_0473	7	`` The National Energy Board approval of the exports just waved the starting flag for the next stage , the rush to build facilities to transport the gas , '' said Bill Koerner , an analyst with Brady & Berliner , a Washington , D.C. , law firm .
wsj_0473	8	Foothills ' main rival to build a Mackenzie Delta pipeline is likely to be TransCanada PipeLines .
wsj_0473	9	The Toronto-based company , together with Tenneco Inc. of Houston , has had an incomplete proposal filed with Canadian regulators since 1984 that it is now updating .
wsj_0473	10	Like Foothills , TransCanada 's Polar Gas consortium plans to build a pipeline directly south from the Mackenzie River delta in Canada 's western Arctic with an initial capacity to transport 1.2 billion cubic feet of gas daily .
wsj_0473	11	Industry sources said they expect a fierce battle to emerge between TransCanada , which has a monopoly on Canadian gas transportation east of Alberta , and Nova and Westcoast , which control the pipelines within and running west of Alberta , respectively .
wsj_0473	12	`` This is virgin territory , unclaimed , and it 's going to be nasty , '' said one observer , who asked not to be named .
wsj_0473	13	`` Neither is going to back down easily . ''
wsj_0473	14	TransCanada declined to comment on the Foothills application .
wsj_0473	15	But last week Gerald Maier , president and chief executive officer of TransCanada , said the company `` intends to be a party to any transportation system that goes up there '' and that it would consider joint ventures with other players to ensure it has a role .
wsj_0473	16	A number of issues still need to be resolved before Canadian regulators give any project the final go-ahead .
wsj_0473	17	First , the price of natural gas will have to almost double .
wsj_0473	18	Kent Jesperson , president of Foothills , said the company believes the project would be viable if gas prices reach US$ 3.25 a thousand cubic feet by 1995 , in current dollars , up from a current spot price of about US$ 1.50 .
wsj_0473	19	Mr. Jesperson 's US$ 3.25 estimate is somewhat below the $ 3.39 floor price that Calgary-based consulting firm Paul Ziff & Co. recently said would be needed for Mackenzie delta gas producers to see a return on their investment .
wsj_0473	20	U.S. gas buyers must also decide whether they want to enter firm contracts for Mackenzie delta gas or develop Alaskan reserves in the Prudhoe Bay area first , a project that has been on hold for more than a decade .
wsj_0473	21	Robert Pierce , chairman and chief executive of Foothills , said it 's too early to say whether Alaskan or Mackenzie delta gas would flow to market first .
wsj_0473	22	But Foothills said it plans to seek regulatory approval to build an alternative line , the Alaska Natural Gas Transportation System further north toward Alaska .
wsj_0473	23	If that option is favored by gas buyers and regulators , Foothills said it would build another smaller pipeline connecting Mackenzie Delta reserves to the Alaska mainline .
wsj_0473	24	It 's also likely that regulators will try to forge some kind of consensus between the would-be pipeline builders before undertaking any hearings into rival projects .
wsj_0473	25	Douglas Stoneman , vice president of Shell Canada , noted that producers would prefer to avoid hearings into competing proposals that would lengthen the regulatory review process and bog down development .
wsj_0473	26	Interprovincial Pipe Line Co. , an oil pipeline operator rumored to be mulling a gas pipeline proposal of its own , said that is n't in the cards .
wsj_0473	27	Instead , Richard Haskayne , president and chief executive of Interprovincial 's Calgary-based parent , Interhome Energy Inc. , said the company would prefer to work with other `` interested parties '' on a joint proposal .
wsj_0473	28	As for Foothills ' pre-emptive bid , Mr. Haskayne said , `` If they think it gives them some kind of priority position , well , that 's their strategy .
wsj_0474	0	The Federal Reserve Board said it is delaying approval of First Union Corp. 's proposed $ 849 million acquisition of Florida National Banks of Florida Inc. , pending the outcome of an examination into First Union 's lending practices in low-income neighborhoods .
wsj_0474	1	The decision reflects the Fed 's tougher stance on enforcing the Community Reinvestment Act , a federal law passed in 1977 to help low-income residents obtain loans .
wsj_0474	2	In recent years , unions and community groups have won big commitments from banks to make low-interest loans in certain neighborhoods by threatening to hold up proposed acquisitions with protests to the Fed about reinvestment act compliance .
wsj_0474	3	Few petitions , however , have actually delayed or scuttled mergers .
wsj_0474	4	The current dispute involves allegations that Charlotte , N.C.-based First Union has n't lived up to its responsibilities under the reinvestment act .
wsj_0474	5	During the summer , Legal Services Corp. , a Florida legal aid group , filed a petition with the Fed on behalf of residents in four Florida counties .
wsj_0474	6	The petition challenged First Union 's lending record in the state , saying that the bank-holding company had `` shut itself off from contact with the low-income community and is redlining almost every black neighborhood that it serves in the state . ''
wsj_0474	7	In deferring action on the merger , the Fed said , `` The Board does not believe that there is sufficient information in the record at this time to allow it to reach a final conclusion on First Union 's record of helping to meet the credit needs of the communities it serves in Florida and North Carolina , including low to moderate-income neighborhoods in those communities . ''
wsj_0474	8	The Fed said the Comptroller of the Currency is expected to begin a Community Reinvestment Act examination of First Union 's Florida and North Carolina banking units in the next two weeks .
wsj_0474	9	First Union , with assets of about $ 32 billion , said it was disappointed by the delay but said it would cooperate with regulatory authorities .
wsj_0474	10	The bank added that it believes the review will `` demonstrate that First Union is in compliance with the requirements of the Community Reinvestment Act . ''
wsj_0474	11	The company has already missed its initial Oct. 1 target date for completing the merger .
wsj_0474	12	It said yesterday it still expects to close the acquisition later this year or early in 1990 .
wsj_0474	13	Florida National , if acquired , would almost double First Union 's banking franchise in Florida to $ 17 billion in assets .
wsj_0474	14	That would make it the second-largest bank , after Barnett Banks Inc. , in a state widely considered to be the most lucrative banking market in the country .
wsj_0474	15	In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , First Union shares rose 25 cents to $ 23 .
wsj_0474	16	Florida National stock closed unchanged at $ 25.875 in national over-the-counter trading .
wsj_0474	17	Earlier this year , the Fed denied an application by Continental Bank Corp. to purchase Grand Canyon State Bank in Scottsdale , Ariz. , on grounds that Continental had n't fully complied with the Community Reinvestment Act .
wsj_0474	18	At the time , the Fed said the denial , the first ever on such grounds , signaled the agency 's new emphasis on the Community Reinvestment Act .
wsj_0475	0	Eastern Airlines ' creditors committee backed off a move to come up with its own alternative proposals to the carrier 's bankruptcy reorganization plans , according to sources familiar with the committee .
wsj_0475	1	In a meeting in New York yesterday , the committee put on hold instructions it gave two weeks ago to its experts to explore other options for Eastern 's future , the sources said .
wsj_0475	2	The consultants had been working to finish a report this week .
wsj_0475	3	That means Eastern , a unit of Texas Air Corp. of Houston , can go forward with its pitch for creditor approval as early as today , when it is expected to deliver a revised reorganization plan to the committee .
wsj_0475	4	The committee intends to meet next week to make a recommendation on the new plan .
wsj_0475	5	In another development yesterday , creditors were told that $ 40 million they had expected to become available for implementing a reorganization may not materialize , according to one source .
wsj_0475	6	Texas Air has run into difficulty reselling about $ 20 million of debt securities because of problems in the junk bond market , the person said .
wsj_0475	7	And plans to raise another $ 20 million through changes to an insurance policy have hit a snag , the source said .
wsj_0475	8	An Eastern spokesman said `` the $ 40 million will have no effect whatsoever on the asset structure of Eastern 's plan .
wsj_0475	9	Forty million in the total scheme of things is not that significant . ''
wsj_0475	10	It is unclear what caused the creditors to do an about-face on exploring alternatives to Eastern 's new reorganization plan .
wsj_0475	11	However , since Eastern first filed for Chapter 11 protection March 9 , it has consistently promised to pay creditors 100 cents on the dollar .
wsj_0475	12	Because the carrier is still pledging to do that , some committee members successfully argued that there 's little reason yet to explore a different plan , according to one person familiar with the creditors ' position .
wsj_0475	13	Earlier this month the accounting firm of Ernst & Young and the securities firm of Goldman , Sachs & Co. , the experts hired by the creditors , contended that Eastern would have difficulty meeting earnings targets the airline was projecting .
wsj_0475	14	Ernst & Young said Eastern 's plan would miss projections by $ 100 million .
wsj_0475	15	Goldman said Eastern would miss the same mark by at least $ 120 million .
wsj_0475	16	The consultants maintained Eastern would n't generate the cash it needs and would have to issue new debt to meet its targets under the plan .
wsj_0475	17	Eastern at the time disputed those assessments and called the experts ' report `` completely off base . ''
wsj_0475	18	Yesterday , Joel Zweibel , an attorney for Eastern 's creditors committee , declined to comment on whether the experts had ever been instructed to look at other choices and whether they now were asked not to .
wsj_0475	19	He said only that the committee has not yet taken any position on Eastern 's reorganization plan and that the two sides were still negotiating .
wsj_0475	20	`` In every case , people would like to see a consentual plan , '' he said .
wsj_0475	21	Eastern and its creditors agreed in July on a reorganization plan that called for the carrier to sell off $ 1.8 billion in assets and to emerge from Chapter 11 status in late 1989 at two-thirds its former size .
wsj_0475	22	Eastern eventually decided not to sell off a major chunk , its South American routes , which were valued at $ 400 million .
wsj_0475	23	Such a change meant the reorganization plan the creditors had agreed on was no longer valid , and the two sides had to begin negotiating again .
wsj_0475	24	Eastern has publicly stated it is exceeding its goals for getting back into operation and has predicted it would emerge from Chapter 11 proceedings early next year , operating more flights than it originally had scheduled .

wsj_0479	0	Fletcher Challenge Ltd. said its Petrocorp unit agreed to acquire certain Alberta oil and gas interests from Amoco Corp. 's Canadian unit , for about 130 million Canadian dollars US$ 110.6 million .
wsj_0479	1	Fletcher Challenge , a big New Zealand-based forest products concern with forestry operations in Canada , said the assets include stakes in four natural gas fields and one oil field near Provost , Alberta , plus gas processing facilities and about 247,000 acres of undeveloped land .
wsj_0479	2	The proposed purchase requires approval from Investment Canada , which monitors large foreign investments in Canada .

wsj_0480	0	MiniScribe Corp. , Longmont , Colo. , said it introduced a one-inch high , 80-megabyte hard disk drive that it hopes will prove popular with makers of high-performance laptop and portable computers .
wsj_0480	1	The troubled disk drive maker aims with the new 3 1/2-inch disks to revive its reputation and sales growth .
wsj_0480	2	MiniScribe said the disk drives have more memory capacity than other disks that size .
wsj_0480	3	MiniScribe said it expects to begin full volume production of the drives in the U.S. and Singapore in the first quarter next year .
wsj_0480	4	A drive with 120 megabytes of capacity is scheduled for release during the third quarter of 1990 .
wsj_0480	5	MiniScribe has been on the rocks since it disclosed early this year that its earnings reports for 1988 were n't accurate .

wsj_0481	0	The New York Times Co. said it reached a settlement with independent home delivery dealers in the metropolitan New York area that will free the newspaper to expand home delivery circulation .
wsj_0481	1	The settlement stemmed from a lawsuit the dealers filed in 1982 when the Times began its own competing direct delivery service .
wsj_0481	2	The pact calls for the Times to pay dealers $ 3.6 million over six years , as well as other payments in the form of subsidies over three years , based on the number of `` new customers started by the dealers and on pricing structures , '' the Times said .
wsj_0481	3	The amount of the settlement will be taken as a charge against earnings in the fourth quarter .
wsj_0481	4	The settlement , which involves most of the 300 independent newspaper dealers in the New York area , will allow the Times to freely operate its own direct home delivery system .
wsj_0481	5	Home delivery is the fastest growing segment of the Times 's 1.1 million daily circulation .

wsj_0482	0	Mercury Savings & Loan Association , Huntington Beach , Calif. , reported a third-quarter loss of $ 3.9 million , or 61 cents a share , compared with net income of $ 1.4 million , or 22 cents a share , in the year-earlier quarter .
wsj_0482	1	Mercury attributed the loss to rapid prepayments of loans and costs incurred in refinancing many house loans this past spring and summer , when interest rates dipped .
wsj_0482	2	The thrift hired an investment banker earlier this month to advise it regarding a possible sale or merger .
wsj_0482	3	Mercury also is shrinking itself , part of its plan to change its emphasis from buying mortgage loans from mortgage brokers to making loans directly .
wsj_0482	4	Such a focus is `` more profitable , more efficient and gives us a greater sense of control , '' said William A. Shane , Mercury 's senior executive vice president .
wsj_0482	5	As of Sept. 30 , Mercury 's assets were $ 2.25 billion , down from $ 2.62 billion a year ago .
wsj_0482	6	For the nine months , Mercury posted a loss of $ 5.4 million , or 86 cents share , against net income of $ 4 million , or 63 cents share , a year earlier .
wsj_0482	7	Mercury shares closed yesterday at $ 4.625 , up 50 cents , in New York Stock Exchange composite trading .
wsj_0483	0	Bancroft Convertible Fund Inc. , New York , likely will reject a renewed offer from Florida investor Robert I. Green to buy Bancroft for $ 18.95 a share .
wsj_0483	1	Sigmund Levine , Bancroft secretary and treasurer , said the closed-end fund 's directors will consider Mr. Green 's offer in a couple of weeks at a regular meeting .
wsj_0483	2	`` He has n't added anything , '' Mr. Levine said , predicting the board will again reject Mr. Green 's proposal .
wsj_0483	3	In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing , Mr. Green said he had boosted his holdings in Bancroft common to 10.4 % from 8.5 % , and renewed an offer he made in March to acquire the fund .
wsj_0483	4	Mr. Levine noted that Bancroft 's shares have been trading at or above Mr. Green 's offering price for the last several months .
wsj_0483	5	He said Bancroft attorneys are scheduled to meet with Mr. Green 's attorneys in Delaware Chancery Court at the end of this week to respond to the investor 's request for company records for the past five years .
wsj_0483	6	Mr. Green could n't be reached .
wsj_0484	0	Giant Group said a federal court in Delaware has denied a motion by Rally 's Inc. seeking to block a group led by Giant Chairman Burt Sugarman from acquiring more of the company 's shares .
wsj_0484	1	Rally 's , a fast-food chain based in Louisville , Ky. , is contending that Mr. Sugarman and two other company directors failed to disclose to the Securities and Exchange Commission that they intended to acquire a big Rally stake .
wsj_0484	2	Mr. Sugarman has in turn contended that the other major shareholder group -- whose interests are represented by three other directors connected to trusts in the name of the children of the company 's founder , James Patterson -- has ties to a competing fast food chain , Wendy 's International Inc .
wsj_0484	3	The company last week assembled a three-member committee of directors aligned with neither side to analyze the situation .
wsj_0484	4	Each group controls more than 40 % of Rally 's stock .
wsj_0484	5	The company just went public earlier this month .
wsj_0484	6	Rally 's had no comment , but was expected to make an announcement this morning about the situation .
wsj_0485	0	Singer Bette Midler won a $ 400,000 federal court jury verdict against Young & Rubicam in a case that threatens a popular advertising industry practice of using `` sound-alike '' performers to tout products .
wsj_0485	1	The decision in Los Angeles federal court stems from a 1985 Mercury Sable TV ad that Young & Rubicam worked up for Ford Motor Co .
wsj_0485	2	The ad agency had approached Ms. Midler about appearing , but she declined , citing a longstanding policy of refusing advertising work .
wsj_0485	3	The agency then turned to a former backup singer for Ms. Midler who appeared in the ad and crooned what was generally considered a more than credible imitation of Ms. Midler 's 1973 hit song `` Do You Wanna Dance . ''
wsj_0485	4	The appeals court held : `` When a distinctive voice of a professional singer is widely known and is deliberately imitated in order to sell a product , the sellers have appropriated what is not theirs . ''
wsj_0485	5	The judge in the jury trial said there was insufficient evidence to hold Ford liable in the case .
wsj_0485	6	In a statement , Young & Rubicam called the award `` unfortunate but bearable . ''
wsj_0485	7	Peter Laird , a Los Angeles lawyer for Ms. Midler , said , `` We believe that the verdict reaffirms her position and our position that advertisers and advertising agencies can not with impunity imitate the voices of well-known performers .
wsj_0485	8	That is a property right that belongs to the performer . ''
wsj_0485	9	The award , although far less than the $ 10 million , including punitive damages , that Ms. Midler sought , is likely to force Madison Avenue to further rethink how they use famous songs in ads .
wsj_0485	10	Last year 's appeals court decision , for instance , spawned several suits , reportedly including a recent action by the heirs of singer Bobby Darin against McDonald 's Corp. over its `` Mac Tonight '' TV commercials , a rough parody of Mr. Darin 's `` Mack the Knife '' trademark .
wsj_0485	11	The appeals-court decision last year was particularly surprising because the same court had dismissed a similar case in 1970 involving singer Nancy Sinatra and a tire ad -- also a Young & Rubicam product .
wsj_0485	12	Ms. Sinatra sued over the use of her `` These Boots are Made for Walkin ' '' song in the ad .
wsj_0485	13	At that time , the court held that such a claim would interfere with federal copyright law , which has always cracked down on the unauthorized copying of songs and musical compositions but never actual performances .
wsj_0485	14	`` One thing that is a little unnerving is that you had three old men on the court of appeals in California coming up with a statement that Nancy Sinatra is not distinctive but that Bette Midler is .
wsj_0485	15	I am not sure that judges , many of whom I like very much , are proper repositories for making distinctions about pop singers , '' said Richard Kurnit , a New York advertising lawyer .
wsj_0485	16	Nonetheless , Mr. Kurnit said that the latest decisions are having a chilling effect .
wsj_0485	17	`` It has made people think twice about how they use music and is forcing them to be more circumspect about doing a particular rendition of a song in its most famous form , '' he said .

wsj_0486	0	James River Corp. , Richmond , Va. , said it acquired the tissue operations of Buhrmann-Tetterode N.V. of the Netherlands for about $ 77 million .
wsj_0486	1	The Dutch unit , known as Celtona B.V. , is a leading maker of consumer and away-from-home tissue products for the Benelux region .
wsj_0486	2	In addition , the acquisition includes production assets of Invercon Papermils , a maker of household tissue products for the U.K. and Ireland .
wsj_0486	3	The combined operations had 1988 revenue of about $ 100 million .
wsj_0486	4	James River , a maker of pulp , paper and plastic products , already has interests in tissue businesses in France , Spain , Italy and Turkey .
wsj_0486	5	The company said it plans to form European ventures with Italian and Finnish companies .
wsj_0486	6	The Celtona operations would become part of those ventures .
wsj_0487	0	Vitro S.A. of Monterrey , Mexico , said its THR Corp. subsidiary has entered into definitive loan agreements in connection with Vitro 's $ 21.25-a-share tender offer for Anchor Glass Container Corp .
wsj_0487	1	The agreements are with Security Pacific National Bank and an affiliate of Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp .
wsj_0487	2	Proceeds of the loan agreement , together with funds from Vitro , will permit the purchase of all shares outstanding of Anchor and the payment of all related costs and expenses .
wsj_0487	3	Vitro said the definitive agreements require that Anchor obtain a waiver from its bank lenders of existing covenant defaults under its bank facilities .

wsj_0488	0	The dollar finished mostly stronger yesterday , boosted by a modest recovery in share prices .
wsj_0488	1	The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 6.76 points in a spate of bargain-hunting following last week 's declines .
wsj_0488	2	`` Attention is fixed on the stock market for lack of anything else to sink our teeth into , '' said Robert White , a vice president at First Interstate of California .
wsj_0488	3	Some analysts predict that in the absence of market-moving news to push the U.S. unit sharply higher or lower , the currency is likely to drift below 1.80 marks this week .
wsj_0488	4	But others reject the view , and forecast the dollar will continue to hold its current tight trading pattern .
wsj_0488	5	They argue that weakness in both the yen and sterling have helped offset bearish U.S. economic news and have lent support to the dollar .
wsj_0488	6	In late New York trading yesterday , the dollar was quoted at 1.8340 marks , up from 1.8300 marks late Friday , and at 141.90 yen , up from 141.65 yen late Friday .
wsj_0488	7	Sterling was quoted at $ 1.5820 , up from $ 1.5795 late Friday .
wsj_0488	8	The dollar rose against the Swiss and French francs .
wsj_0488	9	In Tokyo Tuesday , the U.S. currency opened for trading at 142.32 yen , up from Monday 's Tokyo close of 142.17 yen .
wsj_0488	10	Last week , the surprise resignation of British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson sent the British pound into a tailspin .
wsj_0488	11	While sterling bounced back from session lows in a bout of short-covering yesterday , foreign exchange dealers said that any hopes that the pound would soon post significant gains have evaporated .
wsj_0488	12	Traders said that statements made over the weekend to quell concern about the stability of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher 's government and the future of her economic program largely failed to reassure investors and bolster the flagging British unit .
wsj_0488	13	In her first televised interview following Mr. Lawson 's resignation , Mrs. Thatcher reiterated her desire to keep sterling strong and warned again that full entry into the European Monetary System 's exchange rate mechanism would provide no easy solution to Britain 's economic troubles .
wsj_0488	14	She said that the timing of the United Kingdom 's entry would depend on the speed with which other members liberalize their economies .
wsj_0488	15	Mrs. Thatcher 's remarks were seen as a rebuff to several leading members of her own Conservative Party who have called for a more clear-cut British commitment to the EMS .
wsj_0488	16	At the same time , a recent poll shows that Mrs. Thatcher has hit the lowest popularity rating of any British leader since polling began 50 years ago .
wsj_0488	17	Comments by John Major , who has succeeded Mr. Lawson , also failed to damp market concern , despite his pledge to maintain relatively high British interest rates .
wsj_0488	18	According to one London-based analyst , even higher interest rates wo n't help the pound if Britain 's government continues to appear unstable .
wsj_0488	19	One U.S. trader , however , dismissed sterling doomsayers while acknowledging there is little immediate upside potential for the U.K. unit .
wsj_0488	20	`` There is no question that the situation is bad , but we may be painting a gloomier picture than we should , '' he said .
wsj_0488	21	He predicts the pound will continue to trade in a very volatile fashion , with `` fits of being oversold and overbought '' before recovering its losses .
wsj_0488	22	Dealers also note that the general lack of enthusiasm for the yen has helped bolster the U.S. dollar .
wsj_0488	23	They observe that persistent Japanese investor demand for dollars for both portfolio and direct investment has kept a base of support for the dollar at around 140 yen .
wsj_0488	24	The dollar began yesterday on a firm note in Tokyo , closing higher in late trade .
wsj_0488	25	In Europe , the dollar closed slightly up in a market dominated by cross trades .
wsj_0488	26	On the Commodity Exchange in New York , gold for current delivery settled at $ 377.80 an ounce , down 70 cents .

wsj_0488	28	In early trading in Hong Kong Tuesday , gold was quoted at $ 376.80 an ounce .
wsj_0489	0	General Electric Capital Corp. 's Monogram Bank USA acquired a Visa and MasterCard portfolio from Commercial Federal Savings & Loan Association , an Omaha , Neb. , unit of Commercial Federal Corp. of Omaha .

wsj_0491	0	Fluor Corp. said it was awarded a $ 300 million contract to provide engineering and construction-management services at a copper mine in Irian Jaya , Indonesia , for a unit of Freeport-McMoRan Copper Co .
wsj_0491	1	Fluor , based in Irvine , Calif. , will direct expansion of the mine 's capacity to 52,000 metric tons a day from 32,000 metric tons a day .

wsj_0492	0	Nixdorf Computer AG , citing continued profitability problems , said it will have to reduce personnel further , notably in research and development sectors .

wsj_0494	2	Sam Ginn , chairman and chief executive officer , told securities analysts in New York that the company expects somewhat slower per-share earnings growth in 1990 , although annual growth should return to the traditional figure of about 7 % thereafter .
wsj_0494	3	As factors contributing to the temporary slowdown , he cited one-time rate reductions prescribed by California regulators as a prelude to a new framework that removes profit constraints .
wsj_0494	4	He also mentioned increased capital investment by Pacific Bell for network improvements .
wsj_0494	5	Mr. Ginn said the company 's cellular operations now serve about 341,000 customers , up 46 % from a year ago .

wsj_0495	2	The engine plant may encompass plans for a joint components venture with Jaguar .

wsj_0496	0	Cray Research Inc. won government clearance for its proposed reorganization of founder Seymour Cray 's supercomputer design team into a separate company .
wsj_0496	1	Internal Revenue Service approval of the move as a tax-free transaction was the last hurdle to splitting up the world 's dominant maker of supercomputers , which Mr. Cray founded in 1974 .
wsj_0496	2	Cray 's directors set Nov. 15 as the record date for distribution of shares in the new company , to be called Cray Computer Corp .
wsj_0496	3	It will trade over the counter under the symbol CRAY .
wsj_0496	4	The plan calls for Cray Research holders to receive one share in the new company for every two shares held .
wsj_0496	5	An estimated 14.7 million Cray Computer shares will be distributed , Cray Research said .
wsj_0496	6	Under the accord , Cray Research will transfer to Mr. Cray 's fledgling operation $ 53.3 million of assets primarily related to the Cray-3 development project his team is undertaking and will lend Cray Computer $ 98.6 million .
wsj_0496	7	Cray Research will retain a 10 % interest in the new company , which will be based in Colorado Springs , Colo .
wsj_0496	8	When it announced the planned breakup in May , Cray Research said development costs of several competing projects were squeezing its earnings growth .
wsj_0496	9	After the split , the two companies presumably will be rivals for orders from government and commercial customers .
wsj_0498	0	Priam Corp. said it filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code and announced a 35 % reduction in its world-wide employment .
wsj_0498	1	The filing in bankruptcy court here follows a string of quarterly losses and product glitches for the maker of harddisk drives for minicomputers and microcomputers .
wsj_0498	2	Priam had a loss of $ 25.4 million for the fiscal year ended July 7 , compared with year-earlier profit of $ 543,000 , or two cents a share .
wsj_0498	3	Revenue for the year fell 13 % to $ 122.7 million .
wsj_0498	4	The 200-person staff cutback announced yesterday will bring Priam 's employment to about 380 workers , less than half of what it was before a similar , 230-person reduction in August .
wsj_0498	5	The company yesterday also said it was scrapping one of its major new products , a 760-megabyte drive , which , while technically proficient , did n't hold much promise of generating substantial orders because financing problems caused a nine-month delay in getting the product to market .
wsj_0499	0	The French Economics Ministry approved a planned asset swap between the defense and electronics group Thomson-CSF S.A. and the bank group Credit Lyonnais .
wsj_0499	1	The ministry said the swap , details of which were disclosed last Thursday , will allow both state-controlled companies to reinforce operations in their main markets and argued that the move shows the dynamism of France 's state-sector concerns .
wsj_0499	2	The approval also ends any hope that Banque Nationale de Paris , another state-sector bank , might have had about taking Credit Lyonnais 's place in the accord .
wsj_0499	3	It hinted over the weekend that it would have been interested in a hook-up with Thomson-CSF .
wsj_0499	4	Under details of the accord , Credit Lyonnais will take slightly more than 50 % of Thomson-CSF Finance in exchange for about 14 % of its own shares .
wsj_0499	5	The move will help the bank to keep up with international solvency ratios being phased in by the Bank for International Settlements and will also represent the first time that its voting shares have been held by a party other than the government .

wsj_0508	0	John Lehman 's editorial-page article on the Pentagon as a haunted house omits the real roots of its ghost population `` In the Pentagon , the Undead Walk , '' Oct. 18 .
wsj_0508	1	The media 's treatment of the Defense Department during the Vietnam War , the Carter administration 's denigration of the military , and the public scapegoating of Lt. Col. Oliver North have all served to emasculate the poor souls who live there .
wsj_0508	2	The resulting haunted house tends to reward followership , not leadership , it creates guilt about wearing the uniform , and raises doubt about having the will to fulfill the ghosts ' role , i.e. , to be able to win if called on .
wsj_0508	3	Perhaps the Halloween season is a good time for Congress to be looking at funding for some ghostbusting equipment .
wsj_0508	4	Mike Greece Former Air Force Career Officer New York
wsj_0508	5	Where does Mr. Lehman get off castigating Gen. George Marshall for muscling in on naval prerogatives ?
wsj_0508	6	Ever since the days of Alfred Thayer Mahan U.S. naval officer and naval historian and Teddy Roosevelt the Navy has been the service most favored by Washington officialdom .
wsj_0508	7	Mr. Lehman overlooks the fact that the Navy possesses its own air force the carrier fleet and its own army the Marines , which in turn has its own air force .
wsj_0508	8	Of course these turf battles are unseemly , wasteful and potentially dangerous and should be resolved in the interest of national security , but Mr. Lehman seems to be part of the problem rather than part of the answer .
wsj_0508	9	L.H. Blum Beaumont , Texas
wsj_0508	10	I agree with Mr. Lehman 100 % !
wsj_0508	11	Is n't this the same guy who resigned as Navy secretary because he could n't get his 1,000-ship Navy ?

wsj_0509	0	For the sixth time in as many years , Continental Airlines has a new senior executive .
wsj_0509	1	Gone is D. Joseph Corr , the airline 's chairman , chief executive and president , appointed only last December .
wsj_0509	2	Mr. Corr resigned to pursue other business interests , the airline said .
wsj_0509	3	He could not be reached for comment .
wsj_0509	4	Succeeding him as chairman and chief executive will be Frank Lorenzo , chairman and chief executive of Continental 's parent , Texas Air Corp .
wsj_0509	5	Mr. Lorenzo , 49 years old , is reclaiming the job that was his before Mr. Corr signed on .
wsj_0509	6	The airline also named Mickey Foret as president .
wsj_0509	7	Mr. Foret , 44 , is a 15-year veteran of Texas Air and Texas International Airlines , its predecessor .
wsj_0509	8	Most recently he had been executive vice president for planning and finance at Texas Air .
wsj_0509	9	Top executives at Continental have n't lasted long , especially those recruited from outside .
wsj_0509	10	But Mr. Corr 's tenure was shorter than most .
wsj_0509	11	The 48-year-old Mr. Corr was hired largely because he was credited with returning Trans World Airlines Inc. to profitability while he was its president from 1986 to 1988 .
wsj_0509	12	Before that , he was an executive with a manufacturing concern .
wsj_0509	13	At Continental he cut money-losing operations , which helped produce a modest profit in this year 's second quarter .
wsj_0509	14	But Mr. Corr , a stunt pilot in his spare time , was understood to be frustrated by what he regarded as limited freedom under Mr. Lorenzo .
wsj_0509	15	While not officially an executive at Continental during Mr. Corr 's tenure , Mr. Lorenzo is known for keeping close tabs on Texas Air 's operating units .
wsj_0509	16	Continental is Texas Air 's flagship and was built painfully to its present size under Mr. Lorenzo after emerging from bankruptcy proceedings in 1986 .
wsj_0509	17	It 's unclear what role , if any , Mr. Lorenzo 's recent exploration of a possible sale of a stake in Continental had in Mr. Corr 's departure .
wsj_0509	18	One source familiar with the airline said , however , that Mr. Corr was n't informed in advance during the summer when Mr. Lorenzo began discussions with potential buyers .
wsj_0509	19	During his tenure , Mr. Corr attempted through a series of meetings to inform managers of some of the company 's future plans , traveled widely to talk to employees and backed training sessions designed to improve the carrier 's image .
wsj_0509	20	Mr. Foret is one of a handful of executives Mr. Lorenzo has relied on over the years .
wsj_0509	21	Previously , he had served in financial planning positions at the company 's Eastern Airlines unit .
wsj_0509	22	Another longtime ally , Phil Bakes , currently heads Eastern , now in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings .

wsj_0510	0	Doskocil Cos. said its bank-debt payments have been extended until May 31 , 1990 , to give it more time to sell its Wilson Foods Corp. retail and fresh meat operations .

wsj_0510	2	The company acquired the debt when it paid $ 155 million to purchase Wilson last year .

wsj_0520	0	Nashua Corp. , rumored a potential takeover target for six months , said that a Dutch company has sought U.S. approval to buy up to 25 % of Nashua 's shares .
wsj_0520	1	Nashua immediately responded by strengthening a poison-pill plan and saying it will buy back up to one million of its shares , or 10.4 % of the 9.6 million outstanding .
wsj_0520	2	Nashua , whose major business is selling copiers , facsimile machines and related supplies , said Reiss & Co . B.V. of the Netherlands filed a request with the Federal Trade Commission under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act for permission to buy more than $ 15 million of Nashua 's stock but less than 25 % .
wsj_0520	3	Previously , an affiliate of Unicorp Canada disclosed a stake of less than 5 % in Nashua , according to Daniel M. Junius , Nashua 's treasurer .
wsj_0520	4	Nashua 's stock has fluctuated sharply on takeover speculation , rising to a high for the year of $ 42.875 a share in June from $ 29.75 in March .

wsj_0520	6	Its stock has slumped recently , closing unchanged Friday at $ 29 a share in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange ; at that price , the company has a market value of about $ 278.4 million .
wsj_0520	7	Nashua announced the Reiss request after the market closed .
wsj_0520	8	Mr. Junius said Nashua 's `` intention is to remain an independent public company . ''
wsj_0520	9	The company said it amended its shareholder rights plan by reducing to 10 % from 20 % the level of ownership by an outsider that would trigger the issuance to other holders of rights to buy additional shares of Nashua common at half price .
wsj_0520	10	In addition , the company 's board authorized the purchase of up to an additional one million shares .
wsj_0520	11	Under a program approved by the company in 1987 that did n't specify a share amount , Nashua had purchased 481,000 shares through Sept. 29 .
wsj_0520	12	Alex Henderson , an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities , said that while Nashua 's performance this year has been `` atrocious , '' the company nonetheless is attractive as a `` classic breakup candidate because there 's no similarity between its four businesses . ''
wsj_0520	13	He estimated the breakup value at $ 55 a share .
wsj_0520	14	In addition to selling Japanese-made photocopiers and facsimile machines in Europe and copier supplies in the U.S. , Nashua has three other major businesses : labels and tapes , data storage disks for computers and mail-order photofinishing .

wsj_0527	0	Crossland Savings Bank 's stock plummeted after management recommended a suspension of dividend payments on both its common and preferred stock because Crossland may not meet the new government capital criteria effective Dec. 7 .
wsj_0527	1	In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Friday , Crossland closed at $ 5.25 , down $ 1.875 , a 26 % decline .
wsj_0527	2	A spokesman said the savings bank may not qualify for the capital requirements because , under the proposed guidelines , its $ 380 million of preferred stock does n't meet the `` core capital '' criteria outlined under the new Financial Institutions Reform , Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 .
wsj_0527	3	He added that final guidelines to be published in early November will determine whether the bank is in compliance .
wsj_0527	4	Crossland said it retained three investment bankers to assist it in developing and implementing a financial restructuring plan .
wsj_0527	5	It would n't identify the bankers .
wsj_0527	6	Additionally , Crossland reported a third-quarter loss of $ 175.5 million , or $ 13.44 a share , compared with net income of $ 27.1 million , or $ 1.16 a share , a year ago .
wsj_0527	7	A major factor in the third-quarter loss was the write-down of $ 143.6 million of goodwill .
wsj_0527	8	The spokesman said that the proposed guidelines caused Crossland to revise its business objectives and , consequently , to write down the asset value of some previous acquisitions .
wsj_0527	9	Crossland recorded an additional $ 20 million in loan loss reserves in the third quarter .
wsj_0527	10	Net interest income for the third quarter declined to $ 35.6 million from $ 70.1 million a year ago .
wsj_0527	11	However , non-interest income rose to $ 23.5 million from $ 22 million .

wsj_0528	1	Open it and two soulful eyes on a boy 's brown face peer out from the page , pleadingly .
wsj_0528	2	Does the tyke have a good mind about to be wasted ?
wsj_0528	3	Is he a victim of Gramm-Rudman cuts ?
wsj_0528	4	No , but he 's endangered all the same : His new sitcom on ABC needs a following to stay on the air .
wsj_0528	5	ABC has n't had much luck with shows featuring blacks in recent years , and the producers of one new arrival are a bit desperate .
wsj_0528	6	`` Homeroom , '' a show about a black ad executive who gives up the boardroom for a fourth-grade classroom , is flunking the ratings test .
wsj_0528	7	So producers Alyce and Topper Carew spun their Rolodexes and gathered names of black opinion makers to mount a direct-mail campaign .
wsj_0528	8	By wooing a core black audience they figure they might keep the show alive at least until the spring semester .
wsj_0528	9	Using direct mail for a TV show is like fishing for whale with a breaded hook .
wsj_0528	10	It just is n't done .
wsj_0528	11	But employing this kind of gut-wrenching plea to black consciousness makes it even more unusual .
wsj_0528	12	Still , Mr. Carew thinks he can reach a good chunk of the three million-plus black homes he needs by mailing to the almost 10,000 blacks who form what he calls `` the grapevine . ''
wsj_0528	13	`` The grapevine is n't organized , but you and I know it exists , '' says Mr. Carew , referring to the often uncannily small world of black professionals and community leaders .
wsj_0528	14	`` This is a very personal , ethnic style , '' Mr. Carew says . ``
wsj_0528	15	I want people in the barber shops and the beauty shops and standing in line at the rib joints to be talking about the show .
wsj_0528	16	I want white America to talk about it , too , but I 'm convinced that the grapevine is what 's happening . ''
wsj_0528	17	ABC says it is aware of the producers ' action , but the mailing was sent without the network 's blessing .
wsj_0528	18	The letter , in fact , takes a jab at ABC for being a laggard in black programming .
wsj_0528	19	Meanwhile , as the Sunday evening show struggles to stay afloat against the tough competition of `` Murder , She Wrote , '' the grapevine idea is threatening to turn into a weed : The tactic apparently has inspired sample viewings , but accolades are slow in coming .
wsj_0528	20	Doug Alligood , a black advertising executive who tracks black viewing patterns , gives the Carews an `` A '' for marketing moxie , but is n't alone in his lukewarm reaction .
wsj_0528	21	Some shows just do n't impress , he says , and this is one of them .
wsj_0529	0	TransCanada PipeLines Ltd. said it plans to shift its headquarters to Calgary , Alberta , from Toronto next year to cut costs and be closer to the upstream natural-gas industry .
wsj_0529	1	Gerald Maier , president and chief executive officer of the natural-gas pipeline and marketing concern , said the company 's future growth is `` increasingly linked '' to decisions made by Calgary-based gas producers .
wsj_0529	2	`` Since deregulation of the market in 1985 , producers have become much more intensely involved in both transportation and marketing , '' Mr. Maier said . ``
wsj_0529	3	It 's a matter of being close to those suppliers ; many of those companies do n't know us as well as they should . ''
wsj_0529	4	TransCanada transports all gas that moves eastward from Alberta .
wsj_0529	5	That includes all the gas consumed in Ontario and Quebec , along with the bulk of Canadian gas exports to the
wsj_0529	6	Walter Litvinchuk , vice president of Pan-Alberta Gas Ltd. , a Calgary-based gas marketing concern , said the industry will welcome the move .
wsj_0529	7	`` Having more than a token presence here should enhance communications and business relationships , '' Mr. Litvinchuk said . ``
wsj_0529	8	Since the cost of transporting gas is so important to producers ' ability to sell it , it helps to have input and access to transportation companies . ''
wsj_0529	9	The move , which could cost TransCanada as much as 50 million Canadian dollars US$ 42.5 million in relocation and severance payments , should be complete by next summer , Mr. Maier said .
wsj_0529	10	All 700 Toronto-based employees will be offered positions in Calgary , the company said .
wsj_0529	11	The company will save between C$ 4 million and C$ 6 million annually in office expenses and other administrative costs by moving to Calgary , Mr. Maier added .
wsj_0529	12	Part of both the costs and the savings could be passed on to shippers on the TransCanada pipeline through tolls , which are based on the value of the pipeline system and the cost of operating it .
wsj_0529	13	TransCanada is 49.1 % owned by Montreal-based holding company BCE Inc .
wsj_0531	0	Ferro Corp. said it will buy back as many as one million common shares .
wsj_0531	1	The maker of chemical and industrial materials did n't say how much it would pay or when it would make the transactions .
wsj_0531	2	Ferro also said it would cancel the unused portion of a 1987 buy-back plan for administrative reasons .
wsj_0531	3	The plan calls for the company to buy back 2,250,000 shares , which reflects a 3-for-2 stock split this year .

wsj_0532	0	Arthur Price abruptly quit as president and chief executive officer of MTM Entertainment Inc. , a Los Angeles production company that has fallen on hard times .
wsj_0532	1	Mr. Price , 61 years old , also stepped down from the board of TVS Entertainment PLC , the British TV company that last year bought MTM , producer of such TV programs as `` Hill Street Blues '' and `` The Mary Tyler Moore Show . ''
wsj_0532	2	A TVS spokesman said he did n't know Mr. Price 's plans .
wsj_0532	3	James Gatward , TVS 's chief executive , said in a statement that he will `` assume overall responsibility '' for MTM 's operations until a successor is named .
wsj_0532	4	Industry analysts speculated that Mr. Price 's sudden departure may have stemmed from conflicts with Mr. Gatward .
wsj_0532	5	Mr. Price `` wanted to run the MTM business '' and may have regretted selling the company to TVS , suggested Charles Denton , managing director of Zenith Productions , a subsidiary of Carlton Communications PLC , London .
wsj_0532	6	Mr. Gatward declined to comment , and Mr. Price could n't be reached on Friday .
wsj_0532	7	In the TVS statement , Mr. Price said `` leaving MTM was a very difficult decision , '' but added that `` it is now time for a change ... . ''
wsj_0532	8	The $ 320 million purchase of MTM represented an audacious international move for TVS , which then was about half the U.S. concern 's size .
wsj_0532	9	At the time , Mr. Gatward said his friendship with Mr. Price had smoothed the way for its link with the small British company .
wsj_0532	10	But TVS stunned industry analysts last month by disclosing that it expected MTM to post an operating loss for this year .
wsj_0532	11	In that announcement , TVS also said it was trimming production finance and hiring a new U.S. sales manager .
wsj_0532	12	Mr. Gatward has spent a lot of time since late September at MTM 's headquarters ; he eliminated three departments and fired six executives , according to the TVS spokesman .
wsj_0532	13	Further staff cuts are likely , the spokesman indicated .
wsj_0532	14	`` Obviously , we are looking at making economies across the board . ''
wsj_0532	15	TVS blames difficulties in peddling reruns of MTM shows to U.S. broadcasters for the problems at MTM .
wsj_0532	16	The market for reruns sold to local U.S. broadcasters has been weak for the past three or four seasons .
wsj_0532	17	Mr. Price co-founded MTM in 1969 with U.S. actress Mary Tyler Moore and Grant Tinker , her then-husband .
wsj_0532	18	Mr. Tinker later left to become chairman of National Broadcasting Co .
wsj_0532	19	The TVS spokesman said Mr. Price still holds about an 8 % TVS stake , acquired as part of the MTM acquisition .
wsj_0532	20	In late trading on London 's Stock Exchange Friday , TVS shares rose four pence to 195 pence a share .
wsj_0533	0	Two rival bidders for Connaught BioSciences extended their offers to acquire the Toronto-based vaccine manufacturer Friday .
wsj_0533	1	Institut Merieux S.A. , which offered 942 million Canadian dollars US$ 801.2 million , or C$ 37 a share for Connaught , said it would extend its bid , due to expire last Thursday , to Nov. 6 .
wsj_0533	2	A C$ 30-a-share bid by Ciba-Geigy Ltd. , a pharmaceutical company based in Basel , Switzerland , and California-based Chiron Corp. , a bioresearch concern , was extended to Nov. 16 .
wsj_0533	3	It had been due to expire Friday evening .
wsj_0533	4	Merieux previously said it would ensure its bid remained open pending a final decision by Canadian regulators on whether to approve the takeover .
wsj_0533	5	Merieux , a vaccine and bioresearch firm based in Lyon , France , is controlled 50.1 % by state-owned Rhone Poulenc S.A .
wsj_0533	6	The Canadian government previously said Merieux 's bid did n't offer enough `` net benefit '' to Canada to be approved , and gave Merieux an until mid-November to submit additional information .
wsj_0533	7	Merieux officials said last week that they are `` highly confident '' the offer will be approved once it submits details of its proposed investments to federal regulators .
wsj_0533	8	Both offers are conditional on regulatory approvals and enough shares being tendered to give the bidders a majority of Connaught 's shares outstanding .
wsj_0533	9	Institut Merieux , which already holds a 12.5 % stake in Connaught , said that at the close of business Thursday , 5,745,188 shares of Connaught and C$ 44.3 million face amount of debentures , convertible into 1,826,596 common shares , had been tendered to its offer .
wsj_0533	10	At the close of business Thursday , Ciba-Geigy and Chiron said 11,580 common shares had been tendered to their offer .
wsj_0533	11	At last report , Connaught had 21.8 million shares outstanding .
wsj_0533	12	Separately , the Ontario Supreme Court said it will postpone indefinitely a ruling on the lawsuit launched by the University of Toronto against Connaught in connection with the Merieux bid .
wsj_0533	13	In a statement prepared by lawyers for the university and Connaught , the parties said they agreed that as a result of reaching a C 415 million research accord , `` It is unnecessary that there be a judgment on the merits of the case at this time . ''
wsj_0533	14	Lawyers for the two sides were n't immediately available for comment .
wsj_0533	15	The university had sought an injunction blocking Connaught 's board from recommending or supporting an offer for the company by Merieux .

wsj_0534	1	The insurance concern said all conversion rights on the stock will terminate on Nov. 30 .
wsj_0534	2	Until then , Conseco said the stock remains convertible into common stock at the rate of 1.439 shares of common stock for each share of preferred stock , which is equivalent to a conversion price of $ 17.50 a common share .

wsj_0537	0	After days of intense but fruitless negotiations , a federal judge last week threatened to convert William Herbert Hunt 's Chapter 11 personal bankruptcy case into a Chapter 7 liquidation .
wsj_0537	1	Judge Harold C. Abramson raised the possibility after talks to end a feud between two major creditors failed and all three reorganization plans in the case ran into roadblocks .
wsj_0537	2	If the case is converted to Chapter 7 , what remains of the oil tycoon 's once-vast estate -- now believed to have a value of less than $ 125 million -- would be sold off quickly with most of the proceeds going to the Internal Revenue Service , whose claim for $ 300 million in back taxes has priority in the case .
wsj_0537	3	Hundreds of smaller creditors could get nothing , according to attorneys involved .
wsj_0537	4	While admitting such a move would be `` devastating '' to most creditors , Judge Abramson told a courtroom filled with nearly two dozen attorneys that he was concerned about the toll mounting legal bills will take on Mr. Hunt 's shrinking estate and about the fact that , following voting by creditors , none of the reorganization plans appeared to be viable in their present form .
wsj_0537	5	`` It would be a shame to have a Chapter 7 after all the progress in this case , '' said Judge Abramson .
wsj_0537	6	Under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code , a company continues to operate under protection from creditors ' lawsuits while it works out a plan to pay its debts .
wsj_0537	7	Under Chapter 7 , the assets of a company are sold off to pay creditors .
wsj_0537	8	Despite his reluctance to take the latter step , the judge indicated he would move quickly after hearing testimony later this week in the bitter dispute between Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. and Minpeco S.A. , a minerals concern owned by the Peruvian governmemt .
wsj_0537	9	The Manufacturers Hanover Corp. unit , which is seeking repayment of a $ 36 million loan , has asked the court to give its claim priority over that of Minpeco , which won a $ 132 million judgment against Mr. Hunt , his brother Nelson Bunker Hunt and other defendants last year in a case stemming from their alleged attempts to corner the silver market in
wsj_0537	10	While claiming that penalties , legal fees and interest have driven the value of its claim to more than $ 250 million , Minpeco has agreed to settle for an allowed claim of as much as $ 65.7 million .
wsj_0537	11	But even that is disputed by Manufacturers Hanover which , in alliance with the IRS , contends that Minpeco has already collected more than its actual damages from other defendants in the silver-conspiracy case .
wsj_0537	12	Under prodding from Judge Abramson , a Minpeco executive flew in from Peru last week to talk directly with executives from Manufacturers Hanover on a settlement .
wsj_0537	13	Despite long private sessions in both New York and Dallas , the two sides ended the week `` 6,000 miles and many dollars apart , '' according to attorney Hugh Ray , who represents Manufacturers Hanover .
wsj_0537	14	Meanwhile , inside the courtroom , the judge said he would fine attorneys for the two creditors $ 50 every time they referred to each other with terms such as `` liar '' or `` slime . ''
wsj_0537	15	All three major creditors -- the IRS , Minpeco and Manufacturers Hanover -- voted against and effectively doomed a reorganization plan proposed by Mr. Hunt .
wsj_0537	16	A reorganization plan proposed jointly by the IRS and Manufacturers Hanover was stalled by a negative vote from Minpeco .
wsj_0537	17	The mineral concern 's own reorganization plan met a similar fate after opposition from the IRS and Manufacturers Hanover .
wsj_0537	18	Neither plan is dead , however , and the judge could force creditors to accept some version of them after ruling on the Minpeco-Manufacturers Hanover dispute .
wsj_0537	19	Meanwhile , settlement negotiations continue between Mr. Hunt and the IRS , which has already reached a tentative agreement with Nelson Bunker Hunt .
wsj_0537	20	The two sides have been far apart on how much Herbert Hunt will continue to owe the government after his assets are sold .

wsj_0540	2	Leucadia , New York , estimated it had a pre-tax gain on the transaction of $ 57 million , including its part of Brae 's gain .
wsj_0540	3	Because of tax-loss carry-forward , Leucadia said it expects to escape taxes on `` a substantial portion of the gain . ''
wsj_0540	4	The estimated gain for Brae is $ 15 million , including a tax credit of $ 7 million , the sellers said .

wsj_0542	5	In the tender offer supplement , Dow Jones discloses the different growth forecasts but says it views the 20 % growth rate `` as a hoped-for goal '' of Telerate 's management `` and not as a realistic basis on which to project the company 's likely future performance . ''

wsj_0551	2	The transaction is expected to close around year end .
wsj_0552	0	When the economy stumbled in the mid-1970s , Akzo NV fell out of bed .
wsj_0552	1	Towering overcapacity in the synthetic fiber business , which accounted for half of the Dutch chemical company 's sales , led to huge losses and left Akzo 's survival in doubt .
wsj_0552	2	It was n't until the early 1980s that Akzo nursed itself back to health .
wsj_0552	3	Now , as a new downturn in the chemical industry looms , Akzo says it is in far better shape to cope .
wsj_0552	4	Investment analysts generally agree .
wsj_0552	5	Aside from slashing costs and investing heavily in its plants , Akzo has spent 3.9 billion guilders $ 1.88 billion on acquisitions since 1983 to give it better balance .
wsj_0552	6	During the same period , the company has sold about 1.6 billion guilders of assets .
wsj_0552	7	The fibers business , whose products go into textiles , carpeting and myriad industrial uses , now accounts for only 20 % of Akzo 's sales .
wsj_0552	8	`` We have definitely become less cyclical , '' Syb Bergsma , executive vice president-finance , said in an interview .
wsj_0552	9	Still , Akzo has n't yet found a way to achieve another goal : a large presence in the U.S. market for prescription drugs .
wsj_0552	10	Mr. Bergsma said prices for U.S. pharmaceutical companies remain too high , making it unlikely that Akzo will pursue any major acquisitions in that area .
wsj_0552	11	But he said Akzo is considering `` alliances '' with American drug companies , although he would n't elaborate .
wsj_0552	12	An indication of Akzo 's success in reshaping itself will come Thursday when it reports third-quarter results .
wsj_0552	13	Analysts expect the company to show profit of about 225 million guilders , up 9 % from 206.3 million guilders a year earlier .
wsj_0552	14	A bigger test will come next year if , as many analysts expect , bulk chemical prices slump in Europe .
wsj_0552	15	`` Maybe Akzo can surprise the investment world a bit , '' said Jaap Visker , an analyst at Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank NV .
wsj_0552	16	He figures Akzo is likely to be one of the few major chemical companies to show profit growth next year .
wsj_0552	17	The bank projects Akzo will show per-share earnings of 24 guilders in 1990 , up from an estimated 22.5 guilders for this year and the 20.9 guilders reported for 1988 .
wsj_0552	18	At James Capel & Co. in London , analyst Jackie Ashurst notes that Akzo is less exposed than many of its rivals to the most volatile chemical products .
wsj_0552	19	For example , Akzo has only minor petrochemical operations , is small in plastics and does n't make fertilizers .
wsj_0552	20	Thus , while Akzo profited less than many rivals from the boom of recent years in petrochemicals and plastics , it has less to fear from the current slump .
wsj_0552	21	The company is exposed to bulk chemicals , however .
wsj_0552	22	Although bulk-chemical prices have begun falling in the U.S. , they are generally stable in Europe , Mr. Bergsma said .
wsj_0552	23	A decline may come in the first half of 1990 , he said , but the market does n't appear on the verge of a severe downturn .
wsj_0552	24	To reduce the danger of such pricing cycles , Akzo has invested heavily in specialty chemicals , which have highly specific industrial uses and tend to produce much higher profit margins than do bulk chemicals .
wsj_0552	25	Akzo 's biggest move in this area was the 1987 acquisition of Stauffer Chemical Co. 's specialty chemical business for $ 625 million .
wsj_0552	26	In a less glamorous field , Akzo is the world 's biggest producer of industrial salt , used as a raw material for the chemical industry as well as for such tasks as melting ice .
wsj_0552	27	Akzo also makes products derived from salt , such as chlorine and caustic soda .
wsj_0552	28	In the fibers division , profit remains weak , largely because of persistent overcapacity .
wsj_0552	29	But Akzo is still slimming down : It recently announced plans to eliminate about 1,700 fiber-related jobs in the Netherlands and West Germany .
wsj_0552	30	Although the polyester and rayon markets remain mostly bleak , Akzo has high hopes for some emerging fiber businesses , such carbon fibers and aramid , extremely strong fibers used to reinforce tires and metals and to make such products as bullet-proof vests .
wsj_0552	31	Akzo 's Twaron aramid fiber is a distant second to Du Pont Co. 's Kevlar , which dominates the market .
wsj_0552	32	Mr. Bergsma said world-wide industry sales of aramid fibers are expected to total about $ 500 million this year .
wsj_0552	33	Sales growth of 10 % a year seems possible , he said , and Akzo expects its Twaron business to become profitable in 1990 .
wsj_0552	34	Akzo also has spent heavily on acquisitions in paints , auto finishes and industrial coatings .
wsj_0552	35	In August , for example , it completed the $ 110 million acquisition of Reliance Universal Inc. , a U.S. maker of industrial coatings for wood , metals and plastics , from Tyler Corp .
wsj_0552	36	Mr. Bergsma said Akzo is likely to see strong profit growth from coatings as it realizes cost savings and other benefits from its greater scale .
wsj_0552	37	For Akzo 's drug business , where profits have shown litle change for the past five years , Mr. Bergsma predicted moderate profit growth .
wsj_0552	38	Akzo is the leading seller of birth-control pills in Europe but is still seeking regulatory approvals to enter that market in the U.S. and Japan .
wsj_0552	39	Mr. Bergsma said Akzo hopes to have approval to sell its Marvelon pill in the U.S. in 1992 .
wsj_0552	40	Akzo also has small operations in diagnostic tests , generic drugs and veterinary products .
wsj_0552	41	Veterinary products are showing especially strong growth , Mr. Bergsma said .
wsj_0552	42	Among the leading products is a flu shot for horses .
wsj_0554	0	Ogilvy & Mather , whose declining profitability prompted its takeover by WPP Group earlier this year , will see its profit margins bounce back to the `` 11.5 % range '' in 1990 , said Graham Phillips , the agency 's new chairman-elect .
wsj_0554	1	The ad agency 's pretax profit margins were slightly under 10 % at the time of the takeover , according to analysts ; London-based WPP 's goal is to increase margins to 12 % .
wsj_0554	2	Mr. Phillips made his comments during an interview detailing his plans for the agency .
wsj_0554	3	British-born , the 24-year Ogilvy veteran was named last week to succeed Kenneth Roman , who is leaving by year 's end to take a top post at American Express , an Ogilvy client .
wsj_0554	4	Surrounded by stacks of paper , two computers and photos of himself boating and flying , Mr. Phillips laid out several changes he hopes to make at the agency .
wsj_0554	5	First and foremost , Mr. Phillips said he hopes to improve client service .
wsj_0554	6	Ogilvy under the fastidious Mr. Roman gained a reputation as occasionally being high-handed in its treatment of clients , of preaching what strategy a client should -- indeed , must -- follow .
wsj_0554	7	And some of its top client-service executives , including Mr. Phillips , were promoted to the point they were saddled with administrative duties , with little time to see clients .
wsj_0554	8	But Mr. Phillips recently freed himself up to spend more time with clients by delegating much of his administrative work to a deputy .
wsj_0554	9	He also plans to get to know clients that Mr. Roman was closer to , such as Lever Brothers , American Express and Seagram .
wsj_0554	10	The two men are planning joint visits to a number of clients to attempt to smoothly hand over the reins .
wsj_0554	11	`` Clients want to see more of our senior people involved in the business -- not once a month , but two or three times a week , '' he said .
wsj_0554	12	Mr. Phillips also hopes to finally implement a reorganization announced earlier this year but put on hold by the WPP takeover .
wsj_0554	13	The reorganization is supposed to make one-stop shopping -- buying advertising , public relations and design all in one place , or `` Ogilvy Orchestration '' in Ogilvyspeak -- a reality .
wsj_0554	14	Under the reorganization , Ogilvy plans to name one executive on each account as a `` client service director '' to work as the client 's single contact for all those services .
wsj_0554	15	`` There is little or no integration of our work , quality is spotty , there is no single focus , '' Mr. Phillips complained to staffers in March , when the reorganization was announced .
wsj_0554	16	Now Mr. Phillips says he hopes to have the new system in place for several clients -- including American Express , American Telephone & Telegraph and Ryder -- by year 's end .
wsj_0554	17	Industry executives and analysts are divided on whether Mr. Phillips is up to the task .
wsj_0554	18	He is n't as well-known to clients as is Mr. Roman .
wsj_0554	19	Under his watch , office politicking was often rampant in the agency 's New York operation and the office there has had a dismal new-business record for more than a year .
wsj_0554	20	And while last week the agency hired a top Chiat/Day/Mojo executive , Bill Hamilton , to try to bolster its work , `` Graham has to get the revenue of that New York office moving , '' says James Dougherty , an analyst with County NatWest Securities .
wsj_0554	21	The one thing Mr. Phillips clearly does have going for him is continuity , although it is n't certain if that will be enough .
wsj_0554	22	As Mr. Dougherty says , `` The last thing they need is enormous disruption at the top ... and Graham is obviously a long-term member of the Ogilvy Mafia , as we call it . ''
wsj_0554	23	Mr. Phillips and Mr. Roman are indeed quite similar in substance , if not in style .
wsj_0554	24	While Mr. Roman is a workaholic detailsman , Mr. Phillips would rather delegate , leaving him time for his interests outside the office .
wsj_0554	25	Mr. Roman , by contrast , seems rarely to cut loose at all , although he did appear at Ogilvy 's Halloween party Friday decked out in duck feet and a duck hat , costumed as a `` lame duck . ''
wsj_0554	26	Mr. Phillips said the company 's expected margin improvement will be all but inevitable , given that the company 's profitability was dragged down this year by an expensive move to luxurious , oversized new New York headquarters .
wsj_0554	27	The move , budgeted at about $ 7 million , actually came in at about $ 10 million , he said .
wsj_0554	28	But margins will be helped , too , by some other cost-saving steps .
wsj_0554	29	Ogilvy eliminated the mail room staff , closed the executive dining room and , after the takeover , let go half a dozen financial executives .
wsj_0554	30	WPP , which assumes financial control of its businesses in a hands-on way , instituted a new financial system and plans to sublet some floors in Ogilvy 's new headquarters building to outsiders .
wsj_0554	31	The fact that the agency will now be part of a U.K. company , under British accounting rules , will also make the profit picture look better .
wsj_0554	32	Y&R 's Klein Steps Down
wsj_0554	33	Arthur Klein , president of Young & Rubicam 's New York office , stepped down `` temporarily '' in the wake of charges by a federal grand jury in New Haven , Conn. , that he , the agency and another top executive bribed Jamaican tourist officials to win its account in 1981 .
wsj_0554	34	In an internal memo , Alex Kroll , the agency 's chairman , said Mr. Klein decided to remove himself to minimize `` negative reaction '' from prospective clients and others and to prepare for his defense .
wsj_0554	35	`` The fact that he is in the process of defending himself against the present charges could conceivably have an adverse impact on Y&R , '' Mr. Kroll wrote .
wsj_0554	36	He said Mr. Klein will return to his post at the end of the trial `` at which he will be vindicated . ''
wsj_0554	37	Mr. Klein will work with Mr. Kroll on some of the agency 's joint venture activities and acquisitions while the case is pending .
wsj_0554	38	Peter Georgescu , president of Y&R 's ad operations , will assume Mr. Klein 's day-to-day role .
wsj_0554	39	Wells Rich 's New Partner
wsj_0554	40	Wells , Rich , Greene named Cheryl Heller as an executive vice president and creative partner in its image group , which concentrates on fashion and visually oriented advertising .
wsj_0554	41	Ms. Heller , 38 , had headed up Boston agency Heller/Breene , a unit of WCRS .
wsj_0554	42	The agency , with about $ 35 million in billings , will be dissolved , with some of its staffers absorbed by WCRS 's Della Femina McNamee unit in Boston , Ms. Heller said .
wsj_0554	43	She said it was too early to say what would happen to its clients , including Reebok and Apple .
wsj_0554	44	At Wells Rich , Ms. Heller will concentrate on accounts that include Philip Morris 's Benson & Hedges cigarette brand , which relies on print ads , Ms. Heller 's specialty .
wsj_0554	45	As previously reported , the account is troubled , with Philip Morris asking Backer Spielvogel Bates , Ogilvy & Mather , and possibly others to try their hand at developing new creative work .
wsj_0554	46	Wells Rich declined to comment on the status of the account , as did the other agencies .
wsj_0555	0	Waxman Industries Inc. said holders of $ 6,542,000 face amount of its 6 1/4 % convertible subordinated debentures , due March 15 , 2007 , have elected to convert the debt into about 683,000 common shares .
wsj_0555	1	The conversion price is $ 9.58 a share .
wsj_0555	2	The company said the holders represent 52 % of the face amount of the debentures .
wsj_0555	3	Waxman sells a variety of hardware products for the home repair market .
wsj_0556	0	R.H. Macy & Co. , the closely held department store chain , said in a financial filing Friday that its sales for the fiscal fourth quarter ended July 29 were up 10 % to $ 1.59 billion against $ 1.44 billion a year earlier .
wsj_0556	1	Comparable store sales for the quarter were up 7.3 % .
wsj_0556	2	The net loss for the quarter was $ 43.1 million against a year-earlier loss of $ 106 million .
wsj_0556	3	The loss in the fourth quarter of 1988 reflected in part expenses for an unsuccessful bid for Federated Department Stores Inc. , as well as the restructuring of some of its department store operations .
wsj_0556	4	For the year , sales were up 5.6 % to $ 6.97 billion compared with $ 6.61 billion in fiscal 1988 .
wsj_0556	5	Sales for both years reflect 12-month performances for each year of I. Magnin , Bullock 's , and Bullocks Wilshire .
wsj_0556	6	Macy acquired those three businesses in May 1988 .
wsj_0556	7	On a comparable store basis , including the new acquisitions for both years , sales for fiscal 1989 were up 1.9 % .
wsj_0556	8	Macy reported a net loss for fiscal 1989 of $ 53.7 million compared with a net loss of $ 188.2 million for fiscal 1988 .
wsj_0556	9	The company 's earnings before interest , taxes and depreciation , which bondholders use a measurement of the chain 's ability to pay its existing debt , increased 11 % in fiscal 1989 to $ 926.1 million from $ 833.6 million .
wsj_0556	10	The $ 833.6 million figures includes the new acquisitions .
wsj_0556	11	Excluding those businesses , earnings before interest , taxes and depreciation for 1988 would have been $ 728.5 million .
wsj_0556	12	As of Feb. 1 , 1990 , the Bullocks Wilshire stores will operate as I. Magnin stores .
wsj_0556	13	Altogether , Macy and its subsidiaries own or lease 149 department stores and 61 specialty stores nationwide .
wsj_0556	14	Although management led a leveraged buy-out of R.H. Macy in July 1986 , the company still makes financial filings because of its publicly traded debt .
wsj_0556	15	The company estimates its total debt at about $ 5.2 billion .
wsj_0556	16	This includes $ 4.6 billion of long-term debt , $ 457.5 million in short-term debt , and $ 95.7 million of the current portion of long-term debt .
wsj_0556	17	In a letter to investors , Chairman Edward S. Finkelstein wrote that he expects the company to `` benefit from some of the disruption faced by our competitors .
wsj_0556	18	While our competitors are concerned with their financial viability and possible ownership changes , we will be concentrating on buying and selling merchandise our customers need and want . ''
wsj_0556	19	Mr. Finkelstein is apparently referring to B. Altman and Bonwit Teller , two New York retailers that have recently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection , as well as the retail chains owned by financially troubled Campeau Corp .
wsj_0556	20	Those chains include Bloomingdale 's , which Campeau recently said it will sell .
wsj_0556	21	Other retail properties for sale include Saks Fifth Avenue and Marshall Field , retailers now owned by B.A.T PLC , the British tobacco conglomerate .
wsj_0556	22	In his letter , Mr. Finkelstein also referred to the recent San Francisco earthquake .
wsj_0556	23	Mr. Finkelstein flew to San Francisco the day after the earthquake , and found that 10 to 12 of his company 's stores had sustained some damage , including the breakage of most windows at the I. Magnin store on Union Square .
wsj_0556	24	`` The volume and profit impact on our fiscal first quarter will not be positive , but looking at the whole fiscal year , we do n't see the effect as material , '' wrote Mr. Finkelstein .
wsj_0557	0	RJR Nabisco Inc. said it agreed to sell its Baby Ruth , Butterfinger and Pearson candy businesses to Nestle S.A. 's Nestle Foods unit for $ 370 million .
wsj_0557	1	The sale , at a higher price than some analysts had expected , helps the food and tobacco giant raise funds to pay debt and boosts Nestle 's 7 % share of the U.S. candy market to about 12 % .
wsj_0557	2	The candy businesses had sales of about $ 154 million last year , which was roughly 12 % of total revenue for RJR 's Planters LifeSavers unit , according to a memorandum distributed by RJR 's owner , Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. , to bankers last December .
wsj_0557	3	The Nestle acquisition includes a candy plant in Franklin Park , Ill. , which employs about 800 workers .
wsj_0557	4	The sale , which had been expected , is part of KKR 's program to pay down $ 5 billion of a $ 6 billion bridge loan by February .
wsj_0557	5	Roughly $ 2 billion of that debt has already been repaid from previous asset sales , and RJR expects to use another $ 2 billion from the pending , two-part sale of most of its Del Monte unit .
wsj_0557	6	That sale , however , could still fall through if financing problems develop .
wsj_0557	7	Thus , it remains crucial for RJR to obtain top dollar for its smaller assets like the candy brands .
wsj_0557	8	Louis Gerstner Jr. , chairman and chief executive officer of New York-based RJR , called the sale a `` significant step '' in the company 's divestiture program , as well as a `` a strategic divestiture . ''
wsj_0557	9	Since KKR bought RJR in February for $ 25 billion of debt , it has agreed to sell nearly $ 5 billion of RJR assets .
wsj_0557	10	RJR 's executives have said they will dispense with certain brands , in particular , that are n't leaders in their markets .
wsj_0557	11	`` RJR Nabisco and Planters LifeSavers will concentrate more on our own core businesses , '' Mr. Gerstner said Friday .
wsj_0557	12	Baby Ruth and Butterfinger are both among the top-selling 15 chocolate bars in the U.S. , but RJR 's overall share of the roughly $ 5.1 billion market is less than 5 % .
wsj_0557	13	Nestle 's share of 7 % before Friday 's purchases is far below the shares of market leaders Hershey Foods Corp. and Mars Inc. , which have about 40 % and 36 % of the market , respectively .
wsj_0557	14	`` This means Nestle is now in the candybar business in a big way , '' said Lisbeth Echeandia , publisher of Orlando , Fla.-based Confectioner Magazine .
wsj_0557	15	`` For them , it makes all kinds of sense .
wsj_0557	16	They 've been given a mandate from Switzerland '' to expand their U.S. chocolate operations .
wsj_0557	17	Nestle S.A. is based in Vevey , Switzerland .
wsj_0557	18	The new candy bars , `` make an important contribution to our Nestle Foods commitment to this very important strategic unit , '' said C. Alan MacDonald , president of Nestle Foods in Purchase , N.Y .
wsj_0558	0	Aetna Life & Casualty Co. 's third-quarter net income fell 22 % to $ 182.6 million , or $ 1.63 a share , reflecting the damages from Hurricane Hugo and lower results for some of the company 's major divisions .
wsj_0558	1	Catastrophe losses reduced Aetna 's net income by $ 50 million , including $ 36 million from Hugo .
wsj_0558	2	Last year catastrophe losses totaled $ 5 million , when net was $ 235.5 million , or $ 2.07 a share .
wsj_0558	3	The year-earlier results have been restated to reflect an accounting change .
wsj_0558	4	The insurer has started processing claims from the Northern California earthquake nearly two weeks ago .
wsj_0558	5	But because these claims are more difficult to evaluate and have been coming in more slowly , the company has no estimate of the impact of the earthquake on fourth-quarter results .
wsj_0558	6	In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday , Aetna closed at $ 60 , down 50 cents .
wsj_0558	7	In the latest quarter , Aetna had a $ 23 million loss on its auto/homeowners line , compared with earnings of $ 33 million last year .
wsj_0558	8	Profit for its commercial insurance division fell 30 % to $ 59 million , reflecting higher catastrophe losses and the price war in the property/casualty market for nearly three years .
wsj_0558	9	However , Aetna 's employee benefits division , which includes its group health insurance operations , posted a 34 % profit gain to $ 106 million .
wsj_0558	10	Third-quarter results included net realized capital gains of $ 48 million , which included $ 27 million from the sale of Federated Investors in August and a $ 15 million tax credit .
wsj_0558	11	In the nine months , net rose 4.3 % to $ 525.8 million or $ 4.67 a share , from $ 504.2 million , or $ 4.41 a share , last year .
wsj_0560	0	When Westinghouse Electric Corp. shuttered its massive steam turbine plant in Lester , Pa. , three years ago , it seemed like the company had pulled the plug on its century-old power generation business .
wsj_0560	1	But now Westinghouse is enjoying a resurgence in demand for both steam and combustion turbines and may even join the growing legion of independent electric producers .
wsj_0560	2	And with its new venture with Japan 's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. , announced last week , it is poised to penetrate growing markets overseas .
wsj_0560	3	For the first time since the mid-1970s , Westinghouse this year has seen a significant increase in orders for power plants .
wsj_0560	4	Most are from independent producers instead of regulated utilities , and Westinghouse believes it will ride a wave of demand stretching over the next six years .
wsj_0560	5	Analysts agree , predicting that the revived market could significantly boost Westinghouse 's bottom line in coming years .
wsj_0560	6	`` Westinghouse 's earnings could be materially enhanced in the mid-1990s or sooner , '' says Russell L. Leavitt , of Salomon Brothers Inc .
wsj_0560	7	The company expects a need for 140,000 megawatts of new generation in the U.S. over the next decade .
wsj_0560	8	Already this year , it has received orders for four 150-megawatt advanced combustion turbines from Florida Power & Light Co. and for two 300-megawatt plants from Intercontinental Energy Corp. , among others .
wsj_0560	9	Westinghouse 's own role as a supplier also is changing .
wsj_0560	10	In the past , the company usually took token equity positions in power plants it supplied as a `` kicker '' to close deals .
wsj_0560	11	But last June 's annnouncement that Westinghouse would put up all of the $ 70 million to build a new 55-megawatt plant could herald a new age .
wsj_0560	12	Westinghouse 's plant will provide electrical power to the Southern California Edison Co. and backup power and steam to the U.S. Borax & Chemical Co .
wsj_0560	13	`` We have n't decided on a strategy yet , but we could become an independent producer depending on whether we 're the developer or just the supplier , '' says Theodore Stern , executive vice president of the company 's energy and utility systems group .
wsj_0560	14	At the same time , Westinghouse hopes its venture with Mitsubishi will help fend off growing competition , particularly in the U.S. , from such European competitors as Asea Brown Boveri AG , Siemens AG , and British General Electric Co .
wsj_0560	15	Under the agreement , Westinghouse will be able to purchase smaller combustion turbines from its Japanese partner , and package and sell them with its own generators and other equipment .
wsj_0560	16	Westinghouse also jointly will bid on projects with Misubishi , giving it an edge in developing Asian markets .
wsj_0560	17	In addition , the two companies will develop new steam turbine technology , such as the plants ordered by Florida Power , and even utilize each other 's plants at times to take advantage of currency fluctuations .
wsj_0560	18	`` Even though we 'll still compete against Mitsubishi , we can also work jointly on some projects , and we 'll gain a lot of sourcing flexibility , '' Mr. Stern contends .
wsj_0560	19	The Westinghouse-Mitsubishi venture was designed as a non-equity transaction , circumventing any possible antitrust concerns .
wsj_0560	20	Westinghouse carefully crafted the agreement because the Justice Department earlier this year successfully challenged a proposed steam turbine joint venture with Asea Brown Boveri .
wsj_0560	21	It is expected that the current surge in demand for new power will be filled primarily by independent producers which , unlike utilities , are n't regulated and therefore do n't need government approval to construct new plants .
wsj_0560	22	Westinghouse expects about half of its new orders for turbines to come from independent producers for at least the next six years .
wsj_0560	23	Despite shutdowns of the company 's Lester and East Pittsburgh plants , the company believes it has sufficient capacity to meet near-term demand with its much smaller and more efficient manufacturing facilities in North Carolina .
wsj_0560	24	Still , Westinghouse acknowledges that demand from independent producers could evaporate if prices for fuel such as natural gas or oil rise sharply or if utilities , which have been pressured by regulators to keep down rates , are suddenly freed to add significant generating capacity .
wsj_0560	25	Even if that scenario occurs , Westinghouse figures it is prepared .
wsj_0560	26	The company already is gearing up for a renaissance of nuclear power even though it has n't received an order for a domestic nuclear plant in a decade .
wsj_0560	27	John C. Marous , chairman and chief executive officer , says he expects a commercial order by 1995 for the company 's AP600 nuclear power plant , which is under development .

wsj_0563	0	Home taping of pre-recorded music cuts into record industry revenues , but banning home taping would hurt consumers even more .
wsj_0563	1	That 's the conclusion of an independent report prepared by the Office of Technology Assessment at the request of the House and Senate judiciary committees .
wsj_0563	2	The report is to be released today .
wsj_0563	3	The report says the availability of such advanced analog recording equipment as cassette recorders does n't seem to increase the quantity of home copying .
wsj_0563	4	That finding , the report says , casts doubt on the record industry 's contention that the new generation of digital recording equipment will inevitably lead to wholesale abuse of copyrighted material by home tapers .
wsj_0563	5	The longstanding position of the Recording Industry Association of America , a trade group based in Washington , D.C. , is that record companies , performers , songwriters and music publishers need to be remunerated by government-imposed fees on the sale of blank tapes and recording equipment to make up for royalties lost to home taping .
wsj_0563	6	`` I think it is a nail in the coffin in any royalty tax proposal , '' says Gary Shapiro , vice president for government and legal affairs of the Electronic Industries Association in Washington .
wsj_0563	7	`` What the report shows is everything we 've been saying for the past eight or nine years -- that audio taping is the best thing to happen for the recording industry .
wsj_0563	8	The people who tape the most buy the most . ''
wsj_0563	9	Trish Heimers , a spokesperson for RIAA says her organization has n't received a copy of the completed report yet and has no immediate comment .
wsj_0563	10	A recent agreement between the recording industry and electronics manufacturers requires that any digital audio tape , or DAT , recorder sold in the U.S. have a built-in device that restricts its ability to make second copies from DAT tape copies of digital compact disks .
wsj_0563	11	But the disappointing sales of DAT machines here and abroad so far have not seemed to warrant the three years of legal wrangling that went into the agreement .
wsj_0563	12	Under current copyright laws , it is considered `` fair use '' to reproduce copyrighted material for one 's personal use or for use by one 's family or friends , while copying for purposes of resale or profit is prohibited .
wsj_0563	13	A survey contained in the 291-page report , `` Copyright and Home Copying : Technology Challenges the Law , '' found that most people consider home copying for such personal use a `` right '' -- a right , moreover , that was exercised by 40 % of Americans over the age of 10 in the past year .
wsj_0563	14	The study says that the `` ambiguous legal status '' of home copying makes it `` appropriate to examine the effects on consumers , as well as on industry . ''
wsj_0563	15	Reports by the Office of Technology Assessment do n't prescribe any specific legislative action but suggest a range of options that Congress may pursue .
wsj_0563	16	The study also says that advent of new communications technologies makes `` an explicit congressional definition of the legal status of home copying more desirable in order to reduce legal and market uncertainties and to prevent de facto changes to copyright law through technology , '' and says that finding an `` appropriate balance of harms and benefits is a political decision , not a technical one .

wsj_0567	0	A two-day meeting of representatives of Cocom , the 17-nation group that oversees exports of sensitive goods to communist countries , did n't take any substantive decisions on trimming the list of items under controls .
wsj_0567	1	Nor did it ease restrictions on exports to Poland and Hungary , according to U.S. officials who attended the talks .
wsj_0567	2	The U.S. had been under pressure from several Cocom members , especially France , West Germany and Italy , to ease restrictions on some types of machine tools , which those countries argued were now widely available to East Bloc countries from non-Cocom members .
wsj_0567	3	For several years some European countries have complained that outdated Cocom lists and restrictions served more to hamper their trade than to add to Western security .
wsj_0567	4	Some countries also have been pressing for special treatment for Hungary and Poland as they move toward more democratic rule , just as special treatment had been agreed on for China .
wsj_0567	5	But U.S. officials said representatives at the meeting decided that this was `` a matter for further discussion at future meetings . ''
wsj_0567	6	They added that `` all of us Cocom members look at the changes in Hungary and Poland in a positive way , but a question of this scope deserves further discussion and study . ''
wsj_0567	7	The officials also said the meeting agreed to continue treating China as a special case , despite the recent repression of dissent there , but to offer no further concessions .
wsj_0567	8	The U.S. officials said that despite the rapid changes under way in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union , all the Cocom members agreed on `` the continuing need for this organization , '' which was founded 40 years ago at the start of the Cold War .
wsj_0567	9	The officials said the meeting agreed to continue working toward `` streamlining '' Cocom 's restricted products list , and to improve procedures for punishing companies that do n't comply with the export restrictions .
wsj_0567	10	The officials said this meeting `` put in motion '' procedural steps that would speed up both of these functions , but that no specific decisions were taken on either matter .
wsj_0570	0	Crane Co. said it holds an 8.9 % stake in Milton Roy Corp. , an analytical-instruments maker , and may seek control of the company .
wsj_0570	1	Crane , a maker of engineered products for aerospace , construction , defense and other uses , made the disclosure in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing .
wsj_0570	2	In the filing , Crane said that in the past it considered seeking control of Milton Roy , of St. Petersburg , Fla. , through a merger or tender offer and that it expects to continue to evaluate an acquisition from time to time .
wsj_0570	3	Crane officials did n't return phone calls seeking comment .
wsj_0570	4	Crane holds 504,200 Milton Roy shares , including 254,200 bought from Sept. 14 to Thursday for $ 15.50 to $ 16.75 each .
wsj_0570	5	In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday , Milton Roy shares leaped $ 2 , to $ 18.375 each , while Crane sank $ 1.125 , to $ 21.125 a share .
wsj_0570	6	John M. McNamara , chief financial officer of Milton Roy , said the company has no comment on Crane 's filing .
wsj_0570	7	Milton Roy recently fended off unsolicited overtures from Thermo Electron Corp. , a Waltham , Mass. , maker of biomedical products .
wsj_0570	8	Milton Roy disclosed in May that it was approached for a possible acquisition by Thermo Electron , which agreed to purchase Milton Roy 's liquid-chromatography line for $ 22 million in February .
wsj_0570	9	Thermo Electron acquired some 6 % of Milton Roy 's common stock before throwing in the towel and reducing its stake in early September .
wsj_0570	10	Gabelli Group began raising its Milton Roy stake in July , and holds 14.6 % , according to a recent SEC filing .
wsj_0570	11	It has n't made merger overtures to the board .
wsj_0570	12	Earlier this month , Milton Roy signed a letter of intent to acquire Automated Custom Systems Inc. , Orange , Calif. , and its sister operation , Environmental Testing Co. , in Aurora , Colo .
wsj_0570	13	The companies are automotive-emissions-testing concerns .
wsj_0570	14	Under the terms , Milton Roy will pay an initial $ 4 million for the operations and additional payments during the next four years based on the earnings performance of the businesses .
wsj_0570	15	In the nine months , Milton Roy earned $ 6.6 million , or $ 1.18 a share , on sales of $ 94.3 million .
wsj_0571	0	Last week the British displayed unusual political immaturity .
wsj_0571	1	The Chancellor of the Exchequer , Nigel Lawson , resigned because Prime Minister Thatcher would not fire her trusted adviser Sir Alan Walters .
wsj_0571	2	The opposition Labor Party leader , Neil Kinnock , in a display of the male chauvinism typical of the British lower class , denounced Mrs. Thatcher for having an independent mind and refusing to heed the men in her Cabinet .
wsj_0571	3	The British press , making a mountain out of a molehill , precipitated an unnecessary economic crisis by portraying Mrs. Thatcher as an autocrat who had thrown economic policy into confusion by driving a respected figure from her government .
wsj_0571	4	Behind the silly posturing lies a real dispute .
wsj_0571	5	Mr. Lawson and his European-minded colleagues want the British pound formally tied to the West German mark .
wsj_0571	6	Sir Alan considers this an ill-advised and costly policy .
wsj_0571	7	As there is an effort to `` anchor the dollar '' either to gold or other currencies , the dispute is worth examining .
wsj_0571	8	Until his resignation , Mr. Lawson had been conducting British monetary policy as if the pound were tied to the mark .
wsj_0571	9	When Mrs. Thatcher cut the top tax rate to 40 % , Mr. Lawson flooded the country with money to prevent the pound from rising against the mark .
wsj_0571	10	As a result , he reignited the inflation that Mrs. Thatcher , through a long and costly effort , had subdued .
wsj_0571	11	With inflation surging , the pound began falling against the mark .
wsj_0571	12	To keep the exchange rate pegged , Mr. Lawson tightened monetary policy and pushed interest rates up to 15 % .
wsj_0571	13	This doubled the mortgage interest rates of the many new homeowners that Mrs. Thatcher 's policies had created , producing widespread disaffection and pushing Labor ahead in the polls .
wsj_0571	14	Instead of realizing his mistake in letting the exchange rate dominate both British economic policy and Mrs. Thatcher 's political fortune , Mr. Lawson pushed for tying the pound formally to the mark by entering the European Monetary System , which subordinates all member currencies to German monetary policy .
wsj_0571	15	This put Mrs. Thatcher in a bind .
wsj_0571	16	The concept of European integration is one of those grand schemes that appeal to intellectuals , the media and the imagination , but are full of practical pitfalls .
wsj_0571	17	If the pound had been tied to the mark , the British would have been unable to cut their exorbitant tax rates .
wsj_0571	18	The reason is simple .
wsj_0571	19	When a country cuts tax rates , it makes itself more attractive to investors and drives up the value of its currency .
wsj_0571	20	It was fear of disturbing EMS exchange-rate relationships that caused the Chirac government in France to be timid about cutting tax rates .
wsj_0571	21	Edouard Balladur , the finance minister at the time , was sold on the tax-cut policy but was concerned that his government would be criticized as anti-European for disturbing the linked European currency relationship .
wsj_0571	22	The price of attracting capital -- whether one 's own or that of foreigners -- is a trade deficit .
wsj_0571	23	To avoid this deficit Mr. Lawson inflated the pound in order to prevent its rise .
wsj_0571	24	This misguided policy could not prevent a British trade deficit .
wsj_0571	25	Consequently , Mr. Lawson saddled Mrs. Thatcher with a record trade deficit , renewed inflation and high interest rates -- three political failures in a row .
wsj_0571	26	Little wonder that Mrs. Thatcher 's opponents were so anxious to keep Mr. Lawson in office .
wsj_0571	27	It is extraordinary that the British Treasury thought it could prevent a trade deficit by inflating the pound .
wsj_0571	28	The British balance-of-payments statistics show that after the top tax rate was cut to 40 % , the flow abroad of British capital slowed , to 50 billion pounds $ 79 billion at the current rate in 1988 from 93 billion pounds in 1986 .
wsj_0571	29	This change in the British capital account required an offsetting change in the trade account , a change that could not be prevented by pegging the currency .
wsj_0571	30	Nigel Lawson was a victim of the immense confusion in thought that has been characteristic of Western financial circles during the 1980s .
wsj_0571	31	The most important governments have ignored the role of low tax rates in attracting real capital investment , instead emphasizing financial flows in response to high interest rates .
wsj_0571	32	This has led them in a fruitless and destructive policy circle .
wsj_0571	33	First comes monetary expansion to drive down the currency 's value that was pushed up by tax-rate reduction .
wsj_0571	34	Then , when the currency falls , interest rates are raised to attract financial flows in order to stabilize the exchange rate .
wsj_0571	35	This policy is totally mindless , and Sir Alan is correct to point out its deficiencies .
wsj_0571	36	Britain and all of Europe need to reconsider the prospects for European integration in light of the possible reunification and neutralization of Germany .
wsj_0571	37	A unified Germany that remained within the Western alliance would give Germany such an overshadowing position that all other members of a unified Europe would become vassals of the German state .
wsj_0571	38	Unless the Soviet Union collapses , German reunification is likely to require Germany 's neutralization .
wsj_0571	39	The implications for Britain , France and the rest of Europe of having their currencies tied to the economic policy of a neutral country need considering before we judge Mr. Lawson 's resignation to be unfortunate .
wsj_0571	40	In the least , we must recognize the futility of trying to use exchange-rate intervention to offset the effects of tax-rate reduction on capital flows .

wsj_0574	1	The price was n't disclosed .
wsj_0574	2	The agreement is subject to government approval .
wsj_0574	3	RA acquired the Howick coal mine Oct. 20 when it bought British Petroleum Co. 's Australian coal interests for $ 275 million .
wsj_0574	4	CRA said then that it was looking for a partner for the mine , which produces more than three million metric tons of coal a year .

wsj_0577	0	Broad Inc. said it doubled its regular quarterly dividend to five cents a share from 2.5 cents on common , and to 4.5 cents a share 2.25 cents on Class B stock , payable Nov. 10 to holders of record Nov. 6 .
wsj_0577	1	The financial services company emerged from the restructuring of Kaufman & Broad , Inc. , which spun off its home-building subsidiary into Kaufman & Broad Home Corp. earlier this year and changed its name to Broad Inc .
wsj_0577	2	For the 10-month fiscal year ended Sept. 30 , Chairman Eli Broad said he expected earnings results to approximate analysts ' estimates , which the company said have been revised upward to 80 cents a share .
wsj_0577	3	This would compare with an estimated loss of 3 cents a share for the comparable 10 months last year , which included restructuring costs .
wsj_0579	0	E.W. Scripps Co. said it has acquired a Georgia cable television company and a Massachusetts publishing firm .
wsj_0579	1	Terms on both deals were n't disclosed .
wsj_0579	2	The media company said it purchased Cable USA Inc. , a privately held cable television system in Carroll County , Ga. , a suburb of Atlanta .
wsj_0579	3	The system is still under construction and will serve a market of 7,600 homes .
wsj_0579	4	The company also has acquired Sundance Publishers and Distributors Inc. , a family owned producer and distributor of educational materials in Littleton , Mass .
wsj_0581	0	CMS Energy Corp. said it would begin paying a 10-cent-a-share quarterly dividend , the company 's first since 1984 .
wsj_0581	1	Consumers Power Co. , now the main unit of CMS Energy , ran into financial problems over its $ 4.2 billion Midland nuclear plant , which was abandoned as a nuclear facility in 1984 because of construction delays and high costs .
wsj_0581	2	CMS is nearly done converting the Midland plant to a gas-fired cogeneration facility at a cost of $ 600 million .
wsj_0581	3	CMS management said Thursday that they planned to recommend paying a modest dividend when the board of directors met Friday .
wsj_0581	4	The dividend will be paid Nov. 22 to shares of record Nov. 7 .
wsj_0581	5	The company suffered a loss of $ 270 million in 1985 , but its financial situation has been improving since then .
wsj_0582	0	Humana Inc. said it expects to receive about $ 27 million in federal income-tax refunds and interest from a court ruling on a tax dispute .
wsj_0582	1	The health-care company said it expects the refund to be included in the first quarter ending Nov. 30 .
wsj_0582	2	The refund is about $ 9 million .
wsj_0582	3	Accrued interest on the refund was about $ 18 million as of Oct. 25 .
wsj_0582	4	The refund stems from a court ruling that found certain payments by Humana subsidiaries to its insurance subsidiary during fiscal 1977 through 1979 were deductible as premiums for liability insurance .
wsj_0584	0	The bolstered cellular agreement between BellSouth Corp. and LIN Broadcasting Corp. carries heightened risks and could fail to fend off McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. , the rival suitor for LIN .
wsj_0584	1	Moreover , the amended pact shows how McCaw 's persistence has pushed LIN and BellSouth into a corner , forcing huge debt on the proposed new company .
wsj_0584	2	The debt , estimated at $ 4.7 billion , could mortgage the cellular company 's future earning power in order to placate some LIN holders in the short term .
wsj_0584	3	The plan still calls for LIN to combine its cellular telephone properties with BellSouth 's and to spin off its broadcasting operations .
wsj_0584	4	But under new terms of the agreement , announced Friday , LIN holders would receive a special cash dividend of $ 42 a share , representing a payout of about $ 2.23 billion , shortly before the proposed merger .
wsj_0584	5	LIN said it expects to borrow the money to pay the dividend , but commitments from banks still have n't been obtained .
wsj_0584	6	Under previous terms , holders would have received a dividend of only $ 20 a share .
wsj_0584	7	In addition , New York-based LIN would exercise its right to buy out for $ 1.9 billion the 55 % equity interest of its partner , Metromedia Co. , in a New York cellular franchise .
wsj_0584	8	That money also would have to be borrowed .
wsj_0584	9	In effect , McCaw has forced LIN 's hand by bidding $ 1.9 billion for the stake earlier this month .
wsj_0584	10	`` We 're taking on more debt than we would have liked to , '' acknowledged Michael Plouf , LIN 's vice president and treasurer .
wsj_0584	11	Although he expressed confidence that the proposed new company 's cash flow would be sufficient to cover interest payments on the debt , he estimated that the company would n't be profitable until 1994 or later .
wsj_0584	12	Analyst estimate the value of the BellSouth proposal at about $ 115 to $ 125 a share .
wsj_0584	13	They value McCaw 's bid at $ 112 to $ 118 a share .
wsj_0584	14	The previous BellSouth pact was valued at about $ 98 to $ 110 a share .
wsj_0584	15	McCaw , the largest provider of cellular telephone service in the U.S. , already owns about 9.4 % of LIN 's stock .
wsj_0584	16	In response to BellSouth 's amended pact , the Kirkland , Wash. , company extended its own offer to buy 22 million LIN shares for $ 125 apiece , which would give McCaw a 50.3 % controlling interest .
wsj_0584	17	Over the weekend , McCaw continued to call for an auction of LIN .
wsj_0584	18	Analysts said they expect McCaw to escalate the bidding again .
wsj_0584	19	`` This game is n't over yet , '' said Joel D. Gross , a vice president at Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp .
wsj_0584	20	`` At some point , it will become non-economical for one company .
wsj_0584	21	But I do n't think we 're at that point yet . ''
wsj_0584	22	Under its revised proposal , Atlanta-based BellSouth would have a 50 % interest in the new cellular company and would be responsible for half of its debt .
wsj_0584	23	To sweeten the pact further -- and to ease concerns of institutional investors -- BellSouth added a provision designed to give extra protection to holders if the regional Bell company ever decides to buy the rest of the new cellular company .
wsj_0584	24	The provision , described as `` back-end '' protection , would require BellSouth to pay a price equivalent to what an outside party might have to pay .
wsj_0584	25	McCaw 's bid also has a similar clause .
wsj_0584	26	Only McCaw 's proposal requires the company to begin an auction process in June 1994 for remaining shares at third-party prices .
wsj_0584	27	To mollify shareholders concerned about the long-term value of the company under the BellSouth-LIN agreement , BellSouth also agreed to pay as much as $ 10 a share , or $ 540 million , if , after five years , the trading value of the new cellular company is n't as high as the value that shareholders would have realized from the McCaw offer .
wsj_0584	28	`` We 're very pleased with the new deal .
wsj_0584	29	We did n't expect BellSouth to be so responsive , '' said Frederick A. Moran , president of Moran Asset Management Inc. , which holds 500,000 LIN shares .
wsj_0584	30	BellSouth 's `` back-end protection was flawed previously .
wsj_0584	31	We think this is a superior deal to McCaw 's .
wsj_0584	32	We did n't think a sleeping Bell mentality would be willing to take on dilution . ''
wsj_0584	33	But Kenneth Leon , a telecommunications analyst with Bear , Stearns & Co. , finds the BellSouth proposal still flawed because the company does n't have to wait five years to begin buying more LIN shares .
wsj_0584	34	`` How many shares will be around in 1995 ? '' he asked .
wsj_0584	35	`` There 's nothing preventing BellSouth from buying up shares in the meanwhile . ''
wsj_0584	36	BellSouth 's revised proposal surprised many industry analysts , especially because of the company 's willingness to accept some dilution of future earnings .
wsj_0584	37	William O. McCoy , president of the company 's BellSouth Enterprises Inc. unit , said the revised agreement with LIN would dilute BellSouth earnings by about 9 % in both 1990 and 1991 and by significantly less thereafter .
wsj_0584	38	Indeed , BellSouth 's cellular operations were among the first in the country to become profitable .
wsj_0584	39	For 1988 , BellSouth earned $ 1.7 billion , or $ 3.51 a share , on revenue of $ 13.6 billion .
wsj_0584	40	Analysts were predicting 1990 BellSouth earnings in the range of $ 3.90 a share , or $ 1.9 billion , but now those estimates are being scaled back .
wsj_0584	41	In composite trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange , BellSouth shares fell 87.5 cents to $ 52.125 .
wsj_0584	42	In national over-the-counter trading , LIN shares soared $ 4.625 to closed at $ 112.625 , while McCaw fell $ 2.50 a share to $ 37.75 .
wsj_0584	43	The proposed BellSouth-LIN cellular company , including the newly acquired Metromedia stake , would give the new entity 55 million potential customers , including about 35 million in the nation 's top 10 markets .
wsj_0584	44	Mr. Leon of Bear Stearns speculated that McCaw , in an attempt to buy time , might consider filing an antitrust suit against BellSouth with the Justice Department and U.S. District Judge Harold Greene , who oversees enforcement of the consent decree that broke up the Bell system in 1984 .
wsj_0584	45	Indeed , McCaw seemed to hint at that option in a brief statement .
wsj_0584	46	Urging LIN directors to conduct `` a fair auction on a level playing field , '' McCaw asked how well the public interest would be served `` with the Bell operating companies controlling over 94 % of all cellular potential customers in the nation 's top 10 markets .
wsj_0586	0	London share prices closed sharply lower Friday in active trading after Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson 's resignation slapped the market and Wall Street 's rapid initial sell-off knocked it down .
wsj_0586	1	London shares were depressed initially by overnight losses in New York and by the drop in sterling after Mr. Lawson 's resignation .
wsj_0586	2	It showed some early resilience after central bank support firmed sterling , but the weight of Wall Street late in London trading , and signs of further weakness in the British pound , proved a hefty load to bear .
wsj_0586	3	New York stocks recovered some of their losses after the London market closed .
wsj_0586	4	The Financial Times 100-share index shed 47.3 points to close at 2082.1 , down 4.5 % from the previous Friday and 6.8 % from Oct. 13 , when Wall Street 's plunge helped spark the current weakness in London .
wsj_0586	5	The 30-share index settled 42.0 points lower at 1678.5 .
wsj_0586	6	Volume was 840.8 million shares , up from 443.6 million Thursday and the week 's most active session .
wsj_0586	7	Dealers said the turnover , largely confined to the 100-share index stocks , partly reflected the flurry of activity typical at the close of a two-week trading account and the start of a new account .
wsj_0586	8	But they said Friday 's focus on the top-tier stocks telegraphed active overseas selling and showed the broad-based fears over the status of the U.K. economy and Britain 's currency in the wake of the upheaval in Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher 's cabinet .
wsj_0586	9	A senior dealer with Warburg Securities noted British Gas , the most active blue-chip stock at 20 million shares traded , was affected by the political implications of Mr. Lawson 's departure and Mrs. Thatcher 's cabinet shuffle .
wsj_0586	10	He attributed the unusually high volume to broad-based selling on fears that the Thatcher government may be in turmoil and Britain 's Labor Party positioned to regain control of the government and renew efforts at nationalization .
wsj_0586	11	British Gas shed 8.5 pence a share to close at 185 pence $ 2.90 .
wsj_0586	12	Other dealers added that the blue-chip stocks in general were hit by profit-taking over concerns that London shares will continue posting declines and the uncertainty over sterling given that Mr. Lawson 's successor , John Major , had only been in the job one day .
wsj_0586	13	Besides British Gas , British Steel skidded 1.74 to 123.5 on turnover of 11 million shares .
wsj_0586	14	British Petroleum fell 5 to 286 on 14 million shares traded .
wsj_0586	15	Dealers said the multinational oil company was pressured by recent brokerage recommendations urging investors to switch into Shell Trading & Transport .
wsj_0586	16	Shell eased 1 to 416 on turnover of 4.8 million shares .
wsj_0586	17	Among the other actively traded blue-chip issues , Imperial Chemical Industries dropped 11 to # 10.86 , Hanson skidded 9.5 to 200.5 , and British Telecom fell 10 to 250 .
wsj_0586	18	In Tokyo , stocks closed lower but above intraday lows in active trading .
wsj_0586	19	The Nikkei index was pressured down by profit-taking triggered by sharp advances made through this week and fell 151.20 points to 35527.29 .
wsj_0586	20	In early trading in Tokyo Monday , the Nikkei index fell 148.85 points to 35378.44 .
wsj_0586	21	On Friday , the Tokyo stock price index of first section issues was down 15.82 at 2681.76 .
wsj_0586	22	First-section volume was estimated at 1.3 billion shares , up from 886 million shares Thursday .
wsj_0586	23	An official at Wako Securities said brokerages ' excessive expectations about recent advances in Tokyu Group shares and real estate issues were dashed Friday .
wsj_0586	24	Dealers placed heavy buy orders in the morning to start the first trading day for November transactions .
wsj_0586	25	But they failed to sell these stocks to client investors , who were cautious about the sharp gains these issues made this week , the Wako official said .
wsj_0586	26	Fund managers said Friday 's profittaking was a natural result of the week 's `` abnormal fever '' in buying real estate , shipbuilding , steel and construction shares .
wsj_0586	27	Frankfurt prices closed lower again Friday , the fourth decline in the past five days and the culmination of a week that saw the DAX index lose 4 % .
wsj_0586	28	The DAX dropped 19.69 points Friday to 1462.93 .
wsj_0586	29	Traders said the continued turbulence in other markets , coupled with the drop in London following the Lawson resignation , were responsible .
wsj_0586	30	Traders said that selling pressure was n't enormous and that the DAX dropped Friday more on a lack of any substantial buying interest .
wsj_0586	31	They said contributing to the downward drift was the fact that many professional traders had chosen to square positions ahead of the weekend .
wsj_0586	32	`` It 's the whole uncertainty about what 's happening around us , '' said Valentin Von Korff , a trader at Credit Suisse First Boston in Frankfurt .
wsj_0586	33	`` If you take away the outside influences , the market itself looks very cheap .
wsj_0586	34	What 's happening here is n't justified by the fundamentals . ''
wsj_0586	35	Traders said the market remains extremely nervous because of the wild swings seen on the New York Stock Exchange last week .
wsj_0586	36	That 's leaving small investors with cold feet , they said , and prompting institutions to take a reserved stance on the sidelines as well , at least until the market in New York settles down somewhat .
wsj_0586	37	Elsewhere , share prices closed lower in Paris , Zurich , Amsterdam , Brussels and Stockholm , and were mixed in Milan .
wsj_0586	38	The British shakeup was widely cited for the declines .
wsj_0586	39	Share prices also closed lower in Sydney , Hong Kong , Singapore , Taipei , Manila , Wellington and Seoul .
wsj_0586	40	Concern about declines in other markets , especially New York , caused selling pressure .

wsj_0591	0	Several of the New York Stock Exchange 's own listed companies , led by giant Contel Corp. , are joining for the first time to complain about program trading and the exchange 's role in it .
wsj_0591	1	Claiming program trading has turned the Big Board into a `` gambling casino , '' Contel Chairman Charles Wohlstetter said that he and at least 20 other corporate executives are forming an unprecedented alliance .
wsj_0591	2	The group , Mr. Wohlstetter said in an interview , wants to end the market 's wild price swings that critics blame on computer-aided program-trading strategies .
wsj_0591	3	The group will complain to Washington , to the heads of program-trading firms and to the heads of the Big Board itself , he said .
wsj_0591	4	`` They should call the exchange Trump East , '' charged Mr. Wohlstetter , the 79-year-old founder of Contel who 's also a former investment banker and stock trader .
wsj_0591	5	`` What is the mission of the financial community --
wsj_0591	6	to help some scavengers or schemers , or help corporate America ? ''
wsj_0591	7	Contel is a $ 6 billion telephone and electronics company .
wsj_0591	8	Pressure has been building on the Big Board in the past two weeks to do something about market volatility , which many investors say is caused by program trading .
wsj_0591	9	The market 's Friday-the-13th plunge of 190 points in the Dow Jones Industrial Average , and the Big Board 's understated response to it , galvanized some longstanding dissatisfaction among companies listed on the exchange .
wsj_0591	10	Last month , program trading accounted for a record 13.8 % of average daily Big Board volume .
wsj_0591	11	Mr. Wohlstetter , for example , said he wrote to Big Board Chairman John J. Phelan Jr. about program trading after the 190-point Dow plunge , and as in previous queries , `` what I get back is gobbledygook . ''
wsj_0591	12	He said he 's upset that Mr. Phelan , trying to calm investors after the plunge , said that investors would simply have to get used to the market 's big price swings .
wsj_0591	13	The Big Board `` is partly to blame for the price swings , because they 're cowards , '' said Mr. Wohlstetter .
wsj_0591	14	`` Their powerful members manage them . ''
wsj_0591	15	The focus of the outcry has been stock-index arbitrage , which accounts for about half the program trading that goes on .
wsj_0591	16	Index arbitragers argue that their trading is healthy because it links markets , but critics say such trading accelerates market movements and increases the chance for a crash .
wsj_0591	17	The Big Board has refused to be drawn into a public debate about program trading .
wsj_0591	18	Richard Grasso , Big Board president , last week said only that the exchange is concerned about all its constituents .
wsj_0591	19	Privately , exchange officials worry that without a hospitable system for program trading at the Big Board , billions of dollars in trading will simply migrate to overseas exchanges such as London 's .
wsj_0591	20	It is partly for this reason that the exchange last week began trading in its own stock `` basket '' product that allows big investors to buy or sell all 500 stocks in the Standard & Poor 's index in a single trade .
wsj_0591	21	One intended customer of the new basket product is index arbitragers , according to the exchange .
wsj_0591	22	Investors have complained for some time about program trading , particularly index arbitrage , to little avail .
wsj_0591	23	But according to some Big Board traders , an organized campaign from exchange-listed companies might make the exchange finally consider big changes .
wsj_0591	24	`` They wo n't fight the listed companies .
wsj_0591	25	Now the assault is on , '' said one top trader .
wsj_0591	26	The Big Board ca n't ban stock-index futures , of course , but it could ban use of its high-speed electronic trading system for program trading or at least encourage securities firms to back off .
wsj_0591	27	The exchange put a bit of a damper on program trading when , last year , it simply started to publish monthly statistics of each firm 's program-trading volume .
wsj_0591	28	Contel 's Mr. Wohlstetter said the group of Big Board companies is n't ready to go public yet with its effort , and that he does n't plan to be the leader once it is public .
wsj_0591	29	However , he said he planned to spend the weekend making calls to gather additional support .
wsj_0591	30	Among those Mr. Wohlstetter said he has been talking to are Sanford Weill of Primerica Corp. , which is the parent of Smith Barney , Harris Upham & Co. ; GTE Corp. 's James Johnson , and ITT Corp. 's Rand Araskog .
wsj_0591	31	None of these chief executives were available for comment .
wsj_0591	32	Among the targets of the Big Board companies ' campaign will be some corporate pension funds that use program-trading strategies to maximize returns on their investments .
wsj_0591	33	For Contel 's part , the company a month ago informed each of its money managers that it would drop them if they give business to program-trading firms .
wsj_0591	34	It was just those kinds of ultimatums that last week succeeded in turning up the heat in the debate .
wsj_0591	35	Kemper Corp. 's Kemper Financial Services unit said it cut off Bear Stearns , Morgan Stanley , Oppenheimer and General Electric Co. 's Kidder , Peabody & Co. unit .
wsj_0591	36	All of the firms except Kidder , which is the second-biggest program trader on Wall Street , quickly announced pull-backs from index arbitrage .
wsj_0591	37	Kidder officials stand by their aggressive use of program trading .
wsj_0591	38	Chief Executive Officer Michael Carpenter said that despite the outcry even by some of Kidder 's own brokers , he believes index arbitrage does n't have a `` negative impact on the market as a whole .
wsj_0591	39	'' However , pressure on Kidder 's parent , GE , could change Kidder 's policy .
wsj_0591	40	GE Chairman John Welch has been `` besieged with phone calls '' complaining about his unit 's program trading , according to a person close to him .
wsj_0593	0	Joseph L. Dionne , chairman and chief executive officer of McGraw-Hill Inc. , was elected to the board of directors of this electronics manufacturer .

wsj_0595	0	Wives May Not Benefit When Men Do Chores
wsj_0595	1	WHEN HUSBANDS take on more housework , they tend to substitute for chores done by the kids rather than by the wife .
wsj_0595	2	Rand Corp. researchers Linda Waite and Frances Goldscheider analyzed a large sample of married women with at least one child at home between the ages of six and 18 .
wsj_0595	3	The women indicated which family member usually did various household chores and the approximate share each did .
wsj_0595	4	Not unexpectedly , wives , whether working or non-working , did by far the most -- about 80 % of the shopping , laundry and cooking , and about two-thirds of housecleaning , washing dishes , child care and family paper work .
wsj_0595	5	Only for yardwork and home maintenance did women do less than half .
wsj_0595	6	But the researchers found that while children 's household tasks eased the mother 's burden appreciably , the husband 's helping hand `` appears to lighten the children 's load almost on a one-for-one basis and to reduce the wife 's responsibility only modestly . ''
wsj_0595	7	This pattern was particularly evident among more highly educated couples .
wsj_0595	8	In these families , husbands took on 80 % more chores than in couples with only grammar school education .
wsj_0595	9	But the kids with highly educated parents did 68 % less housework than those in less-educated families .
wsj_0595	10	`` It is clear , '' Ms. Waite says , `` that most of the effect of increasing education has been to shift who is helping the wife/mother .
wsj_0595	11	Her share decreases , but only slightly . ''
wsj_0595	12	Nursing Home Patients Apt to Be Private Payers
wsj_0595	13	FAR FEWER elderly nursing home residents bankrupt themselves than was previously believed , two recent studies declare .
wsj_0595	14	State governments place very low ceilings on how much property people may own or how much income they may keep if they want welfare help on medical bills .
wsj_0595	15	Conventional wisdom has long held that anywhere from one-fourth to one-half of all elderly long-term care patients are obliged to spend themselves into poverty before qualifying for Medicaid assistance .
wsj_0595	16	But separate reports from Joshua Weiner and Denise Spence of the Brookings Institution and Korbin Liu of the Urban Institute find that `` a surprisingly small proportion '' -- only about 10 % -- of residents start out as private payers but `` spend down '' to Medicaid levels in a single nursing home stay before they die or are discharged .
wsj_0595	17	Another one-third are already on Medicaid when they enter the nursing homes , a considerably higher proportion than the analysts anticipated . )
wsj_0595	18	But a remarkably high percentage -- over half -- are private payers throughout their stay , even a fairly lengthy one .
wsj_0595	19	About one-third pay out of their own pockets , while the rest are covered throughout by Medicare , private insurers or the Veterans Administration .
wsj_0595	20	Both reports are based on several thousand patients sampled in a 1985 nationwide government survey .
wsj_0595	21	The Brookings and Urban Institute authors caution , however , that most nursing home stays are of comparatively short duration , and reaching the Medicaid level is more likely with an unusually long stay or repeated stays .
wsj_0595	22	Moreover , they note , those who manage to pay their own way often do so only by selling their homes , using up life savings or drawing heavily on children and other relatives .
wsj_0595	23	Reagan Era Young Hold Liberal Views
wsj_0595	24	THE REAGAN generation young men and women reaching political maturity during Ronald Reagan 's presidency -- are firmly liberal on race and gender , according to NORC , the social science research center at the University of Chicago .
wsj_0595	25	Many political analysts have speculated that the Reagan years would produce a staunchly conservative younger generation .
wsj_0595	26	NORC 's most recent opinion surveys find the youngest adults indeed somewhat more pro-Reagan and pro-Republican than other adults .
wsj_0595	27	But , says chief investigator Tom Smith , this `` does not translate into support for conservatism in general or into conservative positions on feminist and civil rights issues . ''
wsj_0595	28	Answers to a dozen questions in the 1986 , 1987 , 1988 and 1989 national surveys reveal that men and women in the 18 to 24 age bracket are considerably more liberal on race and gender than were the 18 to 24 year olds in NORC 's polling in the early 1970s and early 1980s .
wsj_0595	29	They were also as liberal or more liberal than any other age group in the 1986 through 1989 surveys .
wsj_0595	30	For example , 66 % of the 18 to 24 year olds in the four latest surveys favored an `` open housing '' law prohibiting homeowners from refusing on racial grounds to sell to prospective buyers .
wsj_0595	31	That compares with 58 % of the similar age group in the 1980 through 1982 surveys and 55 % in the 1972 through 1975 surveys .
wsj_0595	32	Asked whether they agreed or disagreed with the claim that men are emotionally better suited to politics than women , 70 % of the Reagan generation disagreed , compared with under 60 % of younger men and women in the earlier years .
wsj_0595	33	SEPARATED and divorced men and women are far more likely to be smokers than married persons , the Centers for Disease Control discovers ... .
wsj_0595	34	Graduate students are taking longer than ever to get their doctor of philosophy degrees , the National Research Council says .
wsj_0595	35	It estimates the time between college graduation and the awarding of a Ph. D. has lengthened by 30 % over the past 20 years , with the average gap now ranging from about 7.4 years in the physical sciences to 16.2 years in education .
wsj_0597	0	A state trial judge in Illinois gave preliminary approval to a proposed settlement of a suit against a Bank of New York Co. unit , Irving Trust Co. , over the interest rates on Irving 's former One Wall Street Account money-market deposit accounts .
wsj_0597	1	Judge Albert Green , in Cook County Circuit Court in Chicago , also recognized the suit , filed last May by Robert and Cynthia Langendorf , as a class action covering thousands of Irving customers .
wsj_0597	2	The plaintiffs accused Irving of paying less interest than promised in a marketing brochure .
wsj_0597	3	Irving maintained -- and still does -- that its actions were proper under its account agreements with customers .
wsj_0597	4	Under the proposed settlement , customers with valid claims -- to be submitted by Dec. 15 -- will receive `` valuable bank services , '' such as credit cards with reduced finance charges , for two years .
wsj_0597	5	Larry Drury , attorney for the plaintiffs , valued the settlement at between $ 6 million and $ 8 million .

wsj_0606	0	In what could prove a major addition to the Philippines ' foreign-investment portfolio , a Taiwanese company signed a $ 180 million construction contract to build the centerpiece of a planned petrochemical complex .
wsj_0606	1	Taiwan 's USI Far East Corp. , a petrochemical company , initialed the agreement with an unidentified Japanese contractor to build a naphtha cracker , according to Alson Lee , who heads the Philippine company set up to build and operate the complex .
wsj_0606	2	Mr. Lee , president of Luzon Petrochemical Corp. , said the contract was signed Wednesday in Tokyo with USI Far East officials .
wsj_0606	3	Contract details , however , have n't been made public .
wsj_0606	4	The complex is to be located in Batangas , about 70 miles south of Manila .
wsj_0606	5	USI Far East will hold a 60 % stake in Luzon Petrochemical , according to papers signed with the Philippine government 's Board of Investments .
wsj_0606	6	The proposed petrochemical plant would use naphtha to manufacture the petrochemicals propylene and ethylene and their resin derivatives , polypropylene and polyethylene .
wsj_0606	7	These are the raw materials used in making plastics .
wsj_0606	8	The contract signing represented a major step in the long-planned petrochemical project .
wsj_0606	9	At an estimated $ 360 million , the project would represent the single largest foreign investment in the Philippines since President Corazon Aquino took office in February 1986 .
wsj_0606	10	It also is considered critical to the country 's efforts to both attract other investment from Taiwan and raise heavy industry capabilities .
wsj_0606	11	The project has been in and out of the pipeline for more than a decade .
wsj_0606	12	However , workers ca n't break ground until legal maneuvers to block the complex are resolved , moves which caused the signing to remain questionable up to the last moment .
wsj_0606	13	As previously reported , a member of the Philippines ' House of Representatives has sued to stop the plant .
wsj_0606	14	The legislator , Enrique Garcia , had actively backed the plant , but at the original site in his constituency northwest of Manila .
wsj_0606	15	The country 's Supreme Court dismissed the suit , but Mr. Garcia late last month filed for a reconsideration .
wsj_0606	16	In addition , President Aquino has yet to sign into law a bill removing a stiff 48 % tax on naphtha , the principal raw material to be used in the cracker .
wsj_0606	17	However , at a news conference Thursday , Mrs. Aquino backed the project and said her government was attempting to soothe the feelings of residents at the original site , adjacent to the government 's major petroleum refinery in Bataan province .
wsj_0606	18	`` We have tried our best to tell the people in Bataan that maybe this time it will not go to them , but certainly we will do our best to encourage other investors to go to their province , '' Mrs. Aquino told Manila-based foreign correspondents .
wsj_0606	19	The project appeared to be on the rocks earlier this month when the other major partner in the project , China General Plastics Corp. , backed out .
wsj_0606	20	China General Plastics , another Taiwanese petrochemical manufacturer , was to have a 40 % stake in Luzon Petrochemical .
wsj_0606	21	However , Mr. Lee said that USI Far East is confident other investors will take up the slack .
wsj_0606	22	He said USI Far East has applied to both the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank 's International Finance Corp. for financing that could include equity stakes .

wsj_0613	0	The Singapore and Kuala Lumpur stock exchanges are bracing for a turbulent separation , following Malaysian Finance Minister Daim Zainuddin 's long-awaited announcement that the exchanges will sever ties .
wsj_0613	1	On Friday , Datuk Daim added spice to an otherwise unremarkable address on Malaysia 's proposed budget for 1990 by ordering the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange `` to take appropriate action immediately '' to cut its links with the Stock Exchange of Singapore .
wsj_0613	2	The delisting of Malaysian-based companies from the Singapore exchange may not be a smooth process , analysts say .
wsj_0613	3	Though the split has long been expected , the exchanges are n't fully prepared to go their separate ways .
wsj_0613	4	The finance minister 's order was n't sparked by a single event and does n't indicate a souring in relations between the neighboring countries .
wsj_0613	5	Rather , the two closely linked exchanges have been drifting apart for some years , with a nearly five-year-old moratorium on new dual listings , separate and different listing requirements , differing trading and settlement guidelines and diverging national-policy aims .

wsj_0618	0	The head of the nation 's largest car-dealers group is telling dealers to `` just say no '' when auto makers pressure them to stockpile cars on their lots .
wsj_0618	1	In an open letter that will run today in the trade journal Automotive News , Ron Tonkin , president of the National Car Dealers Association , says dealers should cut their inventories to no more than half the level traditionally considered desirable .
wsj_0618	2	Mr. Tonkin , who has been feuding with the Big Three since he took office earlier this year , said that with half of the nation 's dealers losing money or breaking even , it was time for `` emergency action . ''
wsj_0618	3	U.S. car dealers had an average of 59 days ' supply of cars in their lots at the end of September , according to Ward 's Automotive Reports .
wsj_0618	4	But Mr. Tonkin said dealers should slash stocks to between 15 and 30 days to reduce the costs of financing inventory .
wsj_0618	5	His message is getting a chilly reception in Detroit , where the Big Three auto makers are already being forced to close plants because of soft sales and reduced dealer orders .
wsj_0618	6	Even before Mr. Tonkin 's broadside , some large dealers said they were cutting inventories .
wsj_0618	7	Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. representatives criticized Mr. Tonkin 's plan as unworkable .
wsj_0618	8	It `` is going to sound neat to the dealer except when his 15-day car supply does n't include the bright red one that the lady wants to buy and she goes up the street to buy one , '' a Chrysler spokesman said .
wsj_0619	0	Southern Co. 's Gulf Power Co. unit may plead guilty this week to charges that it illegally steered company money to politicians through outside vendors , according to individuals close to an investigation of the utility holding company .
wsj_0619	1	The tentative settlement between Gulf Power , a Pensacola , Fla. , electric company , and federal prosecutors would mark the end of one part of a wide-ranging inquiry of Southern Co. in the past year .
wsj_0619	2	A grand jury has been investigating whether officials at Southern Co. conspired to cover up their accounting for spare parts to evade federal income taxes .
wsj_0619	3	The grand jury has also been investigating whether Gulf Power executives violated the federal Utility Holding Company Act , which prohibits certain utilities from making political contributions .
wsj_0619	4	The individuals said Gulf Power and federal prosecutors are considering a settlement under which the company would plead guilty to two felony charges and pay fines totaling between $ 500,000 and $ 1.5 million .
wsj_0619	5	Under one count , Gulf Power would plead guilty to conspiring to violate the Utility Holding Company Act .
wsj_0619	6	Under the second count , the company would plead guilty to conspiring to evade taxes .
wsj_0619	7	The guilty pleas would be made solely by Gulf Power , the individuals said .
wsj_0619	8	No employee or vendor would be involved .
wsj_0619	9	A spokesman for Southern Co. would say only that discussions are continuing between Gulf Power and federal prosecutors .
wsj_0619	10	`` We have no further developments to report , '' he said .
wsj_0619	11	Officials at Gulf Power could n't be reached for comment .
wsj_0619	12	And prosecutors declined to comment .
wsj_0619	13	While Southern Co. has been reluctant to discuss the grand jury investigations , Edward L. Addison , chief executive officer , has said the company is prepared to defend its tax and acccounting practices if any charges are brought against it .
wsj_0619	14	Morever , Mr. Addison has said Southern Co. and its units do n't condone illegal political contributions .
wsj_0619	15	Neither Mr. Addison nor any other Southern Co. official has been charged with any wrongdoing in connection with the current inquiries .
wsj_0619	16	The probe of Southern Co. has attracted considerable attention this year because of several events that have befallen the company , including the death of a Gulf Power executive in a plane crash and the disappearance of a company vendor who was to be a key grand jury witness .
wsj_0619	17	Witnesses have said the grand jury has asked numerous questions about Jacob F. `` Jake '' Horton , the senior vice president of Gulf Power who died in the plane crash in April .
wsj_0619	18	Mr. Horton oversaw Gulf Power 's governmental-affairs efforts .
wsj_0619	19	On the morning of the crash , he had been put on notice that an audit committee was recommending his dismissal because of invoicing irregularities in a company audit .
wsj_0619	20	Investigators have been trying to determine whether the crash was an accident , sabotage or suicide .
wsj_0619	21	Gulf Power said in May that an internal audit had disclosed that at least one vendor had used false invoices to fund political causes .
wsj_0619	22	But the company said the political contributions had been made more than five years ago .
wsj_0620	0	Exxon Corp. is resigning from the National Wildlife Federation 's corporate advisory panel , saying the conservation group has been unfairly critical of the Exxon Valdez oil spill along the Alaskan coast .
wsj_0620	1	The federation said Friday that it regrets the resignation , but issued a stinging response that called Exxon a `` corporate pariah '' that should keep an open dialogue with environmentalists .
wsj_0620	2	The federation , with 5.8 million members nationwide , has been one of the sharpest critics of Exxon 's handling of the 11 million gallon tanker spill and has accused the company of repeatedly ignoring requests to meet and discuss it .
wsj_0620	3	The March 24 oil spill soiled hundreds of miles of shoreline along Alaska 's southern coast and wreaked havoc with wildlife and the fishing industry .
wsj_0620	4	Exxon 's Exxon USA unit was one of the charter members of the Corporate Conservation Council , a panel of executives formed in 1982 by the National Wildlife Federation to foster `` frank and open discussions '' between industry and the federation 's leaders .
wsj_0620	5	In a letter to the federation , Raymond Campion , Exxon 's environmental coordinator , said : `` Recent public actions by you regarding the Valdez oil spill have failed to demonstrate any sense of objectivity or fairness . ''
wsj_0620	6	The federation was among the plaintiffs in a lawsuit filed in August against Exxon seeking full payment of environmental recovery costs from the spill .
wsj_0621	0	First Tennessee National Corp. said it would take a $ 4 million charge in the fourth quarter , as a result of plans to expand its systems operation .
wsj_0621	1	The banking company said it reached an agreement in principle with International Business Machines Corp. on a systems operations contract calling for IBM to operate First Tennessee 's computer and telecommunications functions .
wsj_0621	2	Further , under the agreement , First Tennesse would continue to develop the software that creates customer products and sevices .
wsj_0621	3	`` Because personal computers will soon be on the desks of all of our tellers , and customer service and loan representatives , information will be instantly available to help customers with product decisions and provide them with information about their accounts , '' according to John Kelley , executive vice president and corporate services group manager at First Tennessee .
wsj_0621	4	However , about 120 employees will be affected by the agreement .
wsj_0621	5	First Tennessee , assisted by IBM , said it will attempt to place the employees within the company , IBM or other companies in Memphis .
wsj_0621	6	The process will take as many as six months to complete , the company said .
wsj_0621	7	The agreement is subject to the banking company 's board approval , which is expected next month .
wsj_0622	0	The Treasury Department said the U.S. trade deficit may worsen next year , after two years of significant improvement .
wsj_0622	1	In its report to Congress on international economic policies , the Treasury said that any improvement in the broadest measure of trade , known as the current account , `` is likely at best to be very modest , '' and `` the possibility of deterioration in the current account next year can not be excluded . ''
wsj_0622	2	The statement was the U.S. government 's first acknowledgement of what other groups , such as the International Monetary Fund , have been predicting for months .
wsj_0622	3	Continued strength in the dollar was cited as one reason the trade position may deteriorate .
wsj_0622	4	The Treasury 's report , which is required annually by a provision of the 1988 trade act , again took South Korea to task for its exchange-rate policies .
wsj_0622	5	`` We believe that there have continued to be indications of exchange-rate ` manipulation ' '' during the past six months , it said , citing the lack of market forces in South Korea 's exchange-rate system and the use of capital and interest-rate controls to manipulate exchange rates .
wsj_0622	6	The Treasury expressed pleasure , however , with the government of Taiwan , which was cited for exchange-rate manipulation in last year 's report .
wsj_0622	7	The Treasury said Taiwan has liberalized its exchange rate system in the past year .
wsj_0623	0	The fiscal 1989 budget deficit figure came out Friday .
wsj_0623	1	It was down a little .
wsj_0623	2	The next time you hear a Member of Congress moan about the deficit , consider what Congress did Friday .
wsj_0623	3	The Senate , 84-6 , voted to increase to $ 124,000 the ceiling on insured mortgages from the FHA , which lost $ 4.2 billion in loan defaults last year .
wsj_0623	4	Then , by voice vote , the Senate voted a pork-barrel bill , approved Thursday by the House , for domestic military construction .
wsj_0623	5	Compare the Bush request to what the Senators gave themselves :
wsj_0623	6	For construction in West Virginia , Mr. Bush requested $ 4.5 million ; Congress gave Senator Byrd 's state $ 21.5 million .
wsj_0623	7	Senator Byrd is chairman of the Appropriations Committee .
wsj_0623	8	For Iowa , a $ 1.8 million request became $ 12 million for Senator Grassley , ranking minority member of a military construction subcommittee .
wsj_0623	9	Rep. Jamie Whitten of Mississippi and chairman of House Appropriations turned a $ 20 million Bush request for his state into a $ 49.7 million bequest .
wsj_0623	10	Senator Sasser of Tennessee is chairman of the Appropriations subcommittee on military construction ; Mr. Bush 's $ 87 million request for Tennessee increased to $ 109 million .
wsj_0623	11	In a remark someone should remember this time next year , Senator Sasser said , `` I think we 've seen the peak of military construction spending for many years to come . ''
wsj_0623	12	Tell us about spending restraint .
wsj_0623	13	Tell us about the HUD scandals .
wsj_0623	14	Tell us what measure , short of house arrest , will get this Congress under control .
wsj_0624	0	Costa Rica reached an agreement with its creditor banks that is expected to cut that government 's $ 1.8 billion in bank debt by as much as 60 % .
wsj_0624	1	The agreement was announced by Costa Rican President Oscar Arias Friday , as President Bush and other leaders from the Western Hemisphere gathered in the Central American nation for a celebration of democracy .
wsj_0624	2	Costa Rica had been negotiating with the U.S. and other banks for three years , but the debt plan was rushed to completion in order to be announced at the meeting .
wsj_0624	3	The government had fallen $ 300 million behind in interest payments .
wsj_0624	4	Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady called the agreement `` an important step forward in the strengthened debt strategy , '' noting that it will `` when implemented , provide significant reduction in the level of debt and debt service owed by Costa Rica . ''
wsj_0624	5	Under the plan , Costa Rica will buy back roughly 60 % of its bank debt outstanding at a deeply discounted price , according to officials involved in the agreement .
wsj_0624	6	The remainder of the debt will be exchanged for new Costa Rican bonds with a 6 1/4 % interest rate .
wsj_0624	7	The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank are expected to provide approximately $ 180 million to help support the deal , and additional funds are expected from Japan .
wsj_0624	8	Treasury officials say the Costa Rican agreement demonstrates that the Brady debt plan can benefit small debtor countries as well as big debtors , such as Mexico .
wsj_0625	0	The Treasury said it plans to sell $ 2 billion of 51-day cash-management bills today , raising all new cash .
wsj_0625	1	The bills will be dated Oct. 31 and will mature Dec. 21 ,
wsj_0625	2	No non-competitive tenders will be accepted .
wsj_0625	3	Tenders , available in minimum denominations of $ 1 million , must be received by noon EST today at Federal Reserve Banks or branches .
wsj_0625	4	The Treasury also announced details of this week 's unusual bill auction , which has been changed to accommodate the expiration of the federal debt ceiling at midnight tomorrow .
wsj_0625	5	The 13-week and 27-week bills will be issued tomorrow rather than Thursday , Nov. 2 , as originally planned .
wsj_0625	6	The three-month bills will still mature Feb. 1 , 1990 , and the six-month bills on May 3 , 1990 .
wsj_0625	7	The Treasury also said noncompetitive tenders will be considered timely if postmarked no later than Sunday , Oct. 29 , and received no later than tomorrow .
wsj_0625	8	The Treasury said it wo n't be able to honor reinvestment requests from holders of bills maturing Nov. 2 held in the Treasury 's book-entry system .
wsj_0625	9	The department will make payment for bills maturing on Nov. 2 to all investors who have requested reinvestment of their bills on that date , as well as to all account holders who have previously requested payment .
wsj_0626	0	American Pioneer Inc. said it agreed in principle to sell its American Pioneer Life Insurance Co. subsidiary to Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. 's HBJ Insurance Cos. for $ 27 million .
wsj_0626	1	American Pioneer , parent of American Pioneer Savings Bank , said the sale will add capital and reduce the level of investments in subsidiaries for the thrift holding company .
wsj_0626	2	Recently , the boards of both the parent company and the thrift also voted to suspend dividends on preferred shares of both companies and convert all preferred into common shares .
wsj_0626	3	The company said the move was necessary to meet capital requirements .
wsj_0626	4	The transaction is subject to execution of a definitive purchase agreement and approval by various regulatory agencies , including the insurance departments of the states of Florida and Indiana , the company said .
wsj_0626	5	In the second quarter , American Pioneer reported a loss of $ 7.3 million , compared with net income of $ 1.1 million a year earlier .
wsj_0626	6	The banking operation had a loss of $ 8.7 million in the second quarter , largely because of problem real-estate loans , while the insurance operations earned $ 884,000 .
wsj_0627	0	October employment data -- also could turn out to be the most confusing .
wsj_0627	1	On the surface , the overall unemployment rate is expected to be little changed from September 's 5.3 % .
wsj_0627	2	But the actual head count of non-farm employment payroll jobs is likely to be muddied by the impact of Hurricane Hugo , strikes , and less-than-perfect seasonal adjustments , economists said .
wsj_0627	3	The consensus view calls for an overall job gain of 155,000 compared with September 's 209,000 increase .
wsj_0627	4	But the important factory-jobs segment , which last month plunged by 103,000 positions and raised recession fears , is most likely to be skewed by the month 's unusual events .
wsj_0627	5	Several other reports come before Friday 's jobs data , including : the September leading indicators index , new-home sales and October agricultural prices reports due out tomorrow ; the October purchasing managers ' index and September construction spending and manufacturers ' orders on Wednesday ; and October chain-store sales on Thursday .
wsj_0627	6	Friday brings the final count on October auto sales .
wsj_0627	7	`` The employment report is going to be difficult to interpret , '' said Michael Englund , economist with MMS International , a unit of McGraw-Hill Inc. , New York .
wsj_0627	8	Mr. Englund added that next month 's data is n't likely to be much better , because it will be distorted by San Francisco 's earthquake .
wsj_0627	9	What 's more , he believes seasonal swings in the auto industry this year are n't occurring at the same time as in the past , because of production and pricing differences that are curbing the accuracy of seasonal adjustments built into the employment data .
wsj_0627	10	Wednesday 's report from the purchasing agents will be watched to see if the index maintains a level below 50 % , as it has for the past couple of months .
wsj_0627	11	A reading of less than 50 % indicates an economy that is generally contracting while a reading above 50 % indicates an economy that 's expanding .
wsj_0627	12	Samuel D. Kahan , chief financial economist at Kleinwort Benson Government Securities Inc. , Chicago , said that the purchasers ' report is valuable because it often presents the first inkling of economic data for the month .
wsj_0627	13	But he added : `` Some people use the purchasers ' index as a leading indicator , some use it as a coincident indicator .
wsj_0627	14	But the thing it 's supposed to measure -- manufacturing strength -- it missed altogether last month . ''
wsj_0627	15	David Wyss , chief financial economist at Data Resources Inc. , Boston , said that the purchasers ' index `` does miss occasionally , '' adding : `` When it misses one month it tends to miss the next month , too . ''
wsj_0627	16	The consensus view on September leading indicators calls for a gain of 0.3 % , the same as in August .
wsj_0627	17	Economists said greatly increased consumer optimism , a larger money supply and higher stock prices helped lift the index .
wsj_0627	18	All orders-related components , such as consumer-goods orders and building permits , are thought to have been weaker .
wsj_0627	19	Data Resources ' Mr. Wyss added that he will be keeping a closer eye than ususal on October chain-store sales .
wsj_0627	20	Usually , October `` is n't a very interesting month for retail figures because school clothes have been bought and people are waiting for December to buy Christmas presents , '' he said .
wsj_0627	21	But Mr. Wyss said he will watch the numbers to get an inkling of whether consumers ' general buying habits may slack off as much as their auto-buying apparently has .
wsj_0627	22	He noted that higher gasoline prices will help buoy the October totals .
wsj_0627	23	Seasonal factors are also expected to have taken their toll on September new-home sales , which are believed to have fallen sharply from August 's 755,000 units .
wsj_0627	24	Construction spending is believed to have slipped about 0.5 % from August levels , although economists noted the rate probably will pick up in the months ahead in response to hurricane and earthquake damage .
wsj_0628	0	Factory owners are buying new machinery at a good rate this fall , machine tool makers say , but sluggish sales of new cars and trucks raise questions about fourth-quarter demand from the important automotive industry .
wsj_0628	1	September orders for machine tools rebounded from the summer doldrums , but remained 7.7 % below year-earlier levels , according to figures from NMTBA -- the Association for Manufacturing Technology .
wsj_0628	2	Domestic machine tool plants received $ 303 million of orders last month , up 33 % from August 's $ 227.1 million , but still below the $ 328.2 million of September 1988 , NMTBA said .
wsj_0628	3	Machine tools are complex machines ranging from lathes to metal-forming presses that are used to shape most metal parts .
wsj_0628	4	`` Overall demand still is very respectable , '' says Christopher C. Cole , group vice president at Cincinnati Milacron Inc. , the nation 's largest machine tool producer .
wsj_0628	5	`` The outlook is positive for the intermediate to long term . ''
wsj_0628	6	September orders for all U.S. producers , in fact , were slightly above the monthly average for 1988 , a good year for the industry .
wsj_0628	7	`` Aerospace orders are very good , '' Mr. Cole says .
wsj_0628	8	`` And export business is still good .
wsj_0628	9	While some automotive programs have been delayed , they have n't been canceled . ''
wsj_0628	10	`` September was one of the biggest order months in our history , '' says James R. Roberts , vice president , world-wide sales and marketing , for Giddings & Lewis Inc. , Fond du Lac , Wis .
wsj_0628	11	At a recent meeting of manufacturing executives , `` everybody I talked with was very positive , '' he says .
wsj_0628	12	Most say they plan to spend more on factory equipment in 1990 than in 1989 .
wsj_0628	13	But sales of North American-made 1990-model cars are running at an annual rate of only six million , down from 7.1 million a year earlier .
wsj_0628	14	And truck sales also are off more than 20 % .
wsj_0628	15	Auto makers , who began deferring some equipment purchases last spring , can be expected to remain cautious about spending if their sales do n't pick up , machine tool builders say .
wsj_0628	16	Machine tool executives are hopeful , however , that recent developments in Eastern Europe will expand markets for U.S.-made machine tools in that region .
wsj_0628	17	There is demand for state-of-the-art machine tools in the Soviet Union and in other Eastern European countries as those nations strive to improve the efficiency of their ailing factories as well as the quality of their goods .
wsj_0628	18	However , there 's a continuing dispute between machine tool makers and the Defense Department over whether sophisticated U.S. machine tools would increase the Soviet Union 's military might .
wsj_0628	19	`` The Commerce Department says go , and the Defense Department says stop , '' complains one machine tool producer .
wsj_0628	20	If that controversy continues , U.S. machine tool makers say , West German and other foreign producers are likely to grab most of the sales in Eastern Europe .
wsj_0628	21	September orders for machining centers , lathes , milling machines , grinders , boring mills and other machines that shape metal by cutting totaled $ 192.9 million , down 28 % from $ 266.5 million a year earlier , but a 23 % increase from August 's $ 156.3 million , NMTBA said .
wsj_0628	22	Orders last month for metal-forming presses and other machinery to form metal with pressure surged to $ 110.1 million , a 78 % rise from $ 61.7 million a year earlier and a 55 % gain from $ 70.9 million in August .
wsj_0628	23	Today 's presses are large and costly machines , and a few orders can produce a high total for one month that does n't necessarily indicate a trend .
wsj_0628	24	Machine tool shipments last month were $ 281.2 million , a 24 % rise from a year earlier and a 25 % increase from August .
wsj_0628	25	Shipments have run well ahead of 1988 all year , as machine tool builders produce against relatively good backlogs .
wsj_0628	26	U.S. producers had a $ 2.15 billion backlog of unfilled orders at the end of September .
wsj_0628	27	That was up 2.8 % from a year earlier , even though orders for the first nine months of 1989 were down 19 % from the comparable 1988 period .
wsj_0630	0	Lion Nathan Ltd. , a New Zealand brewing and retail concern , said Friday that Bond Corp . Holdings Ltd. is `` committed '' to a transaction whereby Lion Nathan would acquire 50 % of Bond 's Australian brewing assets .
wsj_0630	1	Lion Nathan issued a statement saying it is applying to Australia 's National Companies & Securities Commission , the nation 's corporate watchdog agency , for a modification to takeover regulations `` similar to that obtained by '' S.A. Brewing Holdings Ltd .
wsj_0630	2	SA Brewing , an Australian brewer , last Thursday was given approval to acquire an option for up to 20 % of Bell Resources Ltd. , a unit of Bond Corp .
wsj_0630	3	Bell Resources is acquiring Bond 's brewing businesses for 2.5 billion Australian dollars US$ 1.9 billion .
wsj_0630	4	S.A. brewing would make a takeover offer for all of Bell Resources if it exercises the option , according to the commission .
wsj_0630	5	Bond Corp. , a brewing , property , media and resources company , is selling many of its assets to reduce its debts .
wsj_0630	6	`` Lion Nathan has a concluded contract with Bond and Bell Resources , '' said Douglas Myers , chief executive of Lion Nathan .
wsj_0631	0	Finnair , Finland 's state-owned airline , joined the wave of global airline alliances and signed a wide-ranging cooperation agreement with archrival Scandinavian Airlines System .
wsj_0631	1	Under the accord , Finnair agreed to coordinate flights , marketing and other functions with SAS , the 50%-state-owned airline of Denmark , Norway and Sweden .
wsj_0631	2	The pact also calls for coordination between Finnair and Switzerland 's national carrier , Swissair , with which SAS entered a similar alliance last month .
wsj_0631	3	Finnair and SAS said they plan to swap stakes in each other .
wsj_0631	4	Neither disclosed details pending board meetings next month .
wsj_0631	5	Officials hinted , however , that SAS would take a stake of at least 6 % in Finnair , valued at about $ 40 million at current market prices .
wsj_0631	6	Finnair would receive SAS shares valued at the same amount , officials said .
wsj_0632	0	General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. are now going head to head in the markets for shares of Jaguar PLC , as GM got early clearance from the Federal Trade Commission to boost its stake in the British luxury car maker .
wsj_0632	1	GM confirmed Friday that it received permission late Thursday from U.S. antitrust regulators to increase its Jaguar holdings past the $ 15 million level .
wsj_0632	2	Ford got a similar go-ahead earlier in October , and on Friday , Jaguar announced that the No. 2 U.S. auto maker had raised its stake to 13.2 % , or 24.2 million shares , from 12.4 % earlier in the week .
wsj_0632	3	A spokesman for GM , the No. 1 auto maker , declined to say how many Jaguar shares that company owns .
wsj_0632	4	In late trading Friday , Jaguar shares bucked the downward tide in London 's stock market and rose five pence to 725 pence $ 11.44 .
wsj_0632	5	Trading volume was a moderately heavy 3.1 million shares .
wsj_0632	6	In the U.S. , Jaguar 's American depositary receipts were among the most active issues Friday in national over-the-counter trading where they closed at $ 11.625 each , up 62.5 cents .
wsj_0632	7	Analysts expect that the two U.S. auto giants will move quickly to buy up 15 % stakes in Jaguar , setting up a potential bidding war for the prestigious Jaguar brand .
wsj_0632	8	British government restrictions prevent any single shareholder from going beyond 15 % before the end of 1990 without government permission .
wsj_0632	9	The British government , which owned Jaguar until 1984 , still holds a controlling `` golden share '' in the company .
wsj_0632	10	With the golden share as protection , Jaguar officials have rebuffed Ford 's overtures , and moved instead to forge an alliance with GM .
wsj_0632	11	Jaguar officials have indicated they are close to wrapping up a friendly alliance with GM that would preserve Jaguar 's independence , but no deal has been announced .
wsj_0632	12	Ford , on the other hand , has said it 's willing to bid for all of Jaguar , despite the objections of Jaguar chairman Sir John Egan .
wsj_0632	13	Analysts continued to speculate late last week that Ford may try to force the issue by calling for a special shareholder 's meeting and urging that the government and Jaguar holders remove the barriers to a full bidding contest before December 1990 .
wsj_0632	14	But a Ford spokeswoman in Dearborn said Friday the company has n't requested such a meeting yet .
wsj_0632	15	Individuals close to the situation believe Ford officials will seek a meeting this week with Sir John to outline their proposal for a full bid .
wsj_0632	16	Any discussions with Ford could postpone the Jaguar-GM deal , headed for completion within the next two weeks .
wsj_0632	17	The GM agreement is expected to retain Jaguar 's independence by involving an eventual 30 % stake for the U.S. auto giant as well as joint manufacturing and marketing ventures .
wsj_0632	18	Jaguar and GM hope to win Jaguar shareholders approval for the accord partly by structuring it in a way that would n't preclude a full Ford bid once the golden share expires .
wsj_0632	19	`` There 's either a minority stake package capable of getting Jaguar shareholder approval or there is n't , '' said one knowledgeable individual . ``
wsj_0632	20	If there is n't , the deal wo n't be put forward '' to shareholders .
wsj_0632	21	Union sentiment also could influence shareholder reaction to a Jaguar-GM accord .
wsj_0632	22	GM 's U.K. unit holds crucial talks today with union officials about its consideration of an Ellesmere Port site for its first major engine plant in Britain .
wsj_0632	23	One auto-industry union leader said , `` If they try to build it somewhere else in Europe besides the U.K. , they are going to be in big trouble '' with unionists over any Jaguar deal .
wsj_0635	0	Ciba-Geigy AG , the big Swiss chemicals company , said that it agreed in a letter of intent with Corning Inc. to acquire Corning 's 50 % share of Ciba Corning Diagnostics Corp. , based in Medfield , Mass .

wsj_0635	5	Ciba-Geigy intends to develop the Ciba Corning unit into a `` substantial business , '' making the unit an `` integral part '' of Ciba-Geigy 's `` comprehensive disease management concept .
wsj_0636	0	The NBC network canceled its first new series of the fall TV season , killing Mel Brooks 's wacky hotel comedy `` The Nutt House . ''
wsj_0636	1	The show , one of five new NBC series , is the second casualty of the three networks so far this fall .
wsj_0636	2	Last week CBS Inc. canceled `` The People Next Door . ''
wsj_0636	3	NBC 's comedy had aired Wednesdays at 9:30 p.m. and in five outings had drawn an average of only 13.2 % of homes , lagging behind the Jamie Lee Curtis comedy `` Anything But Love '' on ABC and CBS 's one-hour drama `` Jake and the Fatman . ''

wsj_0637	0	John Labatt Ltd. said it plans a private placement of 150 million Canadian dollars US$ 127.5 million in preferred shares , to be completed around Nov. 1 .

wsj_0637	5	The shares are redeemable after the end of 1994 .

wsj_0637	7	Labatt 's has no takeover bids outstanding currently , he said .

wsj_0641	0	Kerr-McGee Corp. said it will spend $ 42 million to purchase land and relocate its ammonium perchlorate storage facility to Clark County , Nev. , from Henderson , Nev .
wsj_0641	1	The company said it will move the storage and cross-blending operations to a site 23 miles northeast of Las Vegas to distance the operations from residential areas .
wsj_0641	2	Ammonium perchlorate is an oxidizer that is mixed with a propellant to make rocket fuel used in the space shuttle and military rockets .
wsj_0641	3	In May 1988 , an ammonium perchlorate plant in Henderson owned by an American Pacific Corp. unit was leveled by a series of explosions .
wsj_0641	4	After the explosion , Kerr-McGee temporarily shut down its facility just south of Las Vegas for a safety inspection .
wsj_0641	5	American Pacific and Kerr-McGee are the only two U.S. manufacturers of ammonium perchlorate .
wsj_0641	6	When the plant was destroyed , `` I think everyone got concerned that the same thing would happen at our plant , '' a KerrMcGee spokeswoman said .
wsj_0641	7	That prompted Kerr-McGee to consider moving the potentially volatile storage facilities and cross-blending operations away from town .
wsj_0641	8	Kerr-McGee said it has purchased 3,350 acres from the federal government in Clark County and plans to begin construction early next year .
wsj_0641	9	The new facility is expected to begin operations in early 1991 .

wsj_0669	1	Mr. Kume made the earnings projection for fiscal 1990 , ending next March 31 , in an interview with U.S. automotive writers attending the Tokyo Motor Show .
wsj_0669	2	The executive said that the anticipated earnings increase is fairly modest because Nissan is spending heavily to bolster its dealership network in Japan and because of currency-exchange fluctuations .
wsj_0669	3	During the next decade , Mr. Kume said , Nissan plans to boost overseas vehicle production sufficiently to account for a majority of sales outside Japan .
wsj_0669	4	Last year , Mr. Kume said , Nissan exported slightly over one million vehicles , and produced 570,000 cars and trucks at its factories in North America , Europe and Australia .
wsj_0669	5	But by 1992 , he added , Nissan will build one million vehicles a year outside Japan , or sufficient to equal exports .
wsj_0669	6	`` By the end of the 1990s , '' he said , `` we want to be producing roughly two vehicles overseas for every vehicle that we export from Japan . ''
wsj_0669	7	That will involve a substantial increase in overseas manufacturing capacity , he acknowledged , but did n't provide specific details .

wsj_0670	1	The company said it has agreed to sell the extrusion division for $ 15 million to R.D. Werner Co. , a closely held firm based in Greenville , Pa .
wsj_0670	2	The charge is offset by an after-tax gain of about $ 30 million in the quarter from the previously announced pact to sell National Aluminum 's rolling division .
wsj_0670	3	National Intergroup in the year-ago third quarter earned $ 22.5 million , or 97 cents a share , including a gain of $ 18 million from the sale of a steel tube company .
wsj_0670	4	Revenue was $ 778.6 million .
wsj_0670	5	The company also said it continues to explore all options concerning the possible sale of National Aluminum 's 54.5 % stake in an aluminum smelter in Hawesville , Ky .
wsj_0670	6	The sale of the extrusion division is subject to audit adjustments for working capital changes through the closing .
wsj_0670	7	The agreement also provides for potential payments of additional proceeds to National Aluminum over the next two years , depending on the plant 's shipping levels .
wsj_0670	8	The extrusion unit produces bare and painted custom extrusions for building products and construction industries .

wsj_0672	1	In addition , a second Part B premium to cover the cost of the new program of insurance against catastrophic illness will rise to $ 4.90 a month from $ 4 , if Congress does n't change the program .
wsj_0672	2	The House has voted to repeal most of the Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988 , however , which would end the monthly catastrophic-care premium , as well as an unpopular income surtax paid by about 40 % of the wealthier Medicare beneficiaries .
wsj_0672	3	Under a less-sweeping Senate plan , the catastrophic-care monthly premium would continue , rising to $ 4.90 next year , but the surtax would be abolished .
wsj_0672	4	Medicare Part B pays 80 % of a beneficiary 's allowable doctor 's bills after an annual deductible of $ 75 .
wsj_0672	5	The Catastrophic Coverage Act would add a stop-loss provision next year to limit the maximum beneficiaries must pay for doctors .
wsj_0672	6	Both the House and Senate bills to reduce the cost and coverage of the catastrophic-care plan would eliminate the cap on doctor 's bills .
wsj_0672	7	If the House prevails in its efforts to kill the catastrophic-care plan , the monthly Part B premium will be $ 29 next year .
wsj_0672	8	If the Senate plan prevails , the premium will be $ 33.90 , with the additional $ 4.90 going to pay for expanded hospital coverage under Part A of Medicare .
wsj_0672	9	Most of Part A 's costs are paid by a payroll tax on workers and employers .
wsj_0673	0	Lockheed Corp. said it will trim its Aeronautical Systems work force in California and Georgia by several hundred workers , reflecting the defense industry 's decline .
wsj_0673	1	The Lockheed unit has 24,000 workers ; it expects to make the cuts through a combination of furloughs , attrition and retirements .
wsj_0673	2	The reductions should be complete by the end of the year , a spokesman said , adding that the exact number to be cut has n't been determined .
wsj_0673	3	Lockheed reported a $ 32 million third-quarter net loss , largely because of cost overruns on fixed-price military contracts .
wsj_0673	4	Noting that other defense contractors are complaining of losses on such contracts , analysts say taxpayers have been getting illusionary bargains on weapons systems in recent years .
wsj_0673	5	Defense contractors `` can not continue to get contracts on that basis , '' said Howard Rubel , an analyst with C.J. Lawrence , Morgan Grenfell Inc. in New York .
wsj_0673	6	`` The pain is too great .

wsj_0674	3	Separately , Innopac reported a fourth-quarter loss of about C$ 2.6 million , or 18 Canadian cents a share , reflecting inventory write-downs .
wsj_0674	4	The results made net income for the year ended Aug. 31 C$ 2.7 million , or 20 Canadian cents a share , down from C$ 9.7 million , or 70 Canadian cents a share last year .
wsj_0674	5	Revenue was C$ 291.6 million , up from C$ 252 million in 1988 .
wsj_0674	6	Martin Fabi , Innopac 's president and chief executive , said Innopac viewed Mr. Pattison 's decision to seek control as a `` very positive '' move .
wsj_0674	7	`` I 'm happy that he feels positively about our company , '' he said .
wsj_0674	8	Mr. Fabi would n't say directly whether Mr. Pattison has disclosed potential terms for his planned bid for control .
wsj_0674	9	Among other things , Innopac is involved in recycling polystyrene foam products that are often used by fast food chains , such as McDonald 's Corp. , for food packaging .

wsj_0682	0	Federal investigators have identified the problem in last July 's crash of a United Airlines flight in Iowa : a structural flaw that developed during the making of a titanium engine disk .
wsj_0682	1	For several months , officials at the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board have suspected that a metallurgical flaw in the disk led to a crack that ultimately caused the tail engine to break apart in flight .
wsj_0682	2	The explosion sent shards of metal flying , severing the DC-10 's hydraulic or control systems , and led to the crash that killed 112 people .
wsj_0682	3	But investigators could confirm their theory only after the recent retrieval of a big chunk of Flight 232 's tail engine from a cornfield near the Sioux City Airport in Iowa .
wsj_0682	4	The safety board will begin four days of hearings on the accident tomorrow in Sioux City .
wsj_0682	5	Among the issues the board will examine is whether United Airlines , a unit of UAL Corp. , should have been able to detect the cracks through maintenance checks .
wsj_0682	6	The engine involved was a CF6-6 made by General Electric Co .
wsj_0682	7	Anthony Broderick , the FAA 's acting executive director for regulatory standards and compliance , said that recent tests of the failed engine disk indicate that a flaw -- known as `` hard alpha '' -- occurred in the titanium during its production almost 20 years ago .
wsj_0682	8	He said there was n't any way to detect the flaw at that time , and that the process has since been changed to decrease the chance that such flaws would occur .
wsj_0682	9	The FAA already has ordered that all 232 disks made by the old process be removed from the planes and subjected to an ultrasonic test in a water-submersion chamber .
wsj_0682	10	Such tests make the FAA confident that a Sioux City-type accident `` wo n't happen again , '' said Mr. Broderick .
wsj_0682	11	A spokesman for GE said that the company has been working with the FAA all along on this issue and `` will comply fully with the required inspections . ''
wsj_0682	12	But he also pointed out that the recalls will have no impact on GE 's engine production .
wsj_0682	13	The CF6-6 series engines are n't being manufactured any more ; they are only being used in the DC-10 Series 10 planes currently in service , he said .
wsj_0683	0	A frozen mountaintop in Tibet may offer an important clue about whether the Earth is warming perilously .
wsj_0683	1	Researchers at Ohio State University and Lanzhou Institute of Glaciology and Geocryology in China have analyzed samples of glacial ice in Tibet and say temperatures there have been significantly higher on average over the past half-century than in any similar period in the past 10,000 years .
wsj_0683	2	The ice samples are an important piece of evidence supporting theories that the Earth has warmed considerably in recent times , largely because of pollutants in the air , and will warm far more in the century ahead .
wsj_0683	3	A substantial warming would melt some of the Earth 's polar ice caps , raising the level of the oceans and causing widespread flooding of heavily populated coastal areas .
wsj_0683	4	`` If you can use data to reconstruct what happened in the past , you have much more confidence in predictions for the future , '' said Lonnie Thompson , a research scientist at Ohio State who dug for and analyzed the ice samples .
wsj_0683	5	To compare temperatures over the past 10,000 years , researchers analyzed the changes in concentrations of two forms of oxygen .
wsj_0683	6	These measurements can indicate temperature changes , researchers said , because the rates of evaporation of these oxygen atoms differ as temperatures change .
wsj_0683	7	Analysis of ice from the Dunde ice cap , a glacial plateau in Tibet 17,000 feet above sea level , show that average temperatures were higher in 1937-87 than in any other 50-year period since before the last Ice Age , Mr. Thompson said .
wsj_0683	8	Some climate models project that interior regions of Asia would be among the first to heat up in a global warming because they are far from oceans , which moderate temperature changes .
wsj_0683	9	But the ice-core samples are n't definitive proof that the so-called greenhouse effect will lead to further substantial global heating , Mr. Thompson acknowledged .
wsj_0683	10	According to greenhouse theories , increased carbon dioxide emissions , largely caused by burning of fossil fuels , will cause the Earth to warm up because carbon dioxide prevents heat from escaping into space .
wsj_0683	11	Skeptics say that if that 's the case , temperatures should have risen fairly uniformly over the past century , reflecting the increase in carbon dioxide .
wsj_0683	12	Instead , the Dunde ice-core record shows increasing temperatures from 1900 through the early 1950s , decreasing temperatures from the late 1950s through the mid-1970s , then higher temperatures again through last year .
wsj_0683	13	Other temperature data show similar unexplained swings .
wsj_0683	14	`` Climate varies drastically due to natural causes , '' said Mr. Thompson .
wsj_0683	15	But he said ice samples from Peru , Greenland and Antarctica all show substantial signs of warming .

wsj_0688	0	Mobil Corp. is in the midst of cutting back its exploration and production group , which finds and develops oil and gas reserves in the U.S. , by as much as 15 % as part of a new restructuring of that sector of its business .
wsj_0688	1	Management advised employees Friday that it was going to reduce employment in production operations of the group by 8 % , or 400 people .
wsj_0688	2	The exploration side of the unit has recently undergone a similar overhaul , during which it also lost as many as 400 employees , a company spokesman said in response to questions .
wsj_0688	3	Mobil Exploration & Producing U.S. Inc. , the group involved , currently has a work force of somewhat less than 5,000 .
wsj_0688	4	A few years ago , Mobil restructured the entire company during an industrywide shakeout .
wsj_0688	5	But since then U.S. oil production has declined and Mobil wants to focus its oil-finding efforts overseas .
wsj_0688	6	Mobil alluded to the work-force cuts last week when it took a $ 40 million charge as part of its third-quarter earnings and attributed it to a restructuring .
wsj_0688	7	Mobil officials said that it is unlikely any additional charges related to this move will be taken in future quarters .
wsj_0688	8	On Wednesday , Mobil will begin offering separation packages and voluntary retirement in its U.S. production operation .
wsj_0688	9	Mobil officials said they have been studying ways of streamlining these operations since early this year .
wsj_0688	10	During the coming months , layers of management will be peeled away and regional offices will become more autonomous .
wsj_0688	11	For greater efficiency , employees at those locations will be reorganized into teams responsible for managing the properties under their jurisdiction , Mobil said .
wsj_0688	12	`` The main feature of the new organization is that each local manager will have both the authority and accountability for profitable and technically sound operations , '' said Charles E. Spruell , president of the Mobil unit .
wsj_0688	13	Field offices at New Orleans ; Houston ; Denver ; Midland , Tex. ; Bakersfield , Calif. ; Oklahoma City ; and Liberal , Kan. , will be maintained .
wsj_0688	14	But the staffs at some of those locations will be slashed while at others the work force will be increased .
wsj_0688	15	For instance , employment in Denver will be reduced to 105 from 430 .
wsj_0688	16	But on the West Coast , where profitable oil production is more likely than in the midcontinent region , the Bakersfield , Calif. , office staff of 130 will grow by 175 to 305 .
wsj_0688	17	The reorganization will `` focus on the value and potential of assets , '' Mr. Spruell said .
wsj_0691	0	SharesBase Corp. said it will reduce its 221-person work force by about 25 % , effective tomorrow , in an effort to stem continuing losses .
wsj_0691	1	The company , which makes data base systems and software , said it expects to report a loss for the third quarter ended Sept. 30 .
wsj_0692	0	Defense intellectuals have complained for years that the Pentagon can not determine priorities because it has no strategy .
wsj_0692	1	Last April , the new defense secretary , Richard Cheney , acknowledged that , `` given an ideal world , we 'd have a nice , neat , orderly process .
wsj_0692	2	We 'd do the strategy and then we 'd come around and do the budget .
wsj_0692	3	This city does n't work that way . ''
wsj_0692	4	With a five-year defense plan costing more than $ 1.6 trillion , it 's about time we put together a defense strategy that works in Washington .
wsj_0692	5	This wo n't happen until strategists come down from their ivory tower and learn to work in the real world of limited budgets and uncertain futures .
wsj_0692	6	As it is , we identify national goals and the threats to these goals , we shape a strategy to counter these threats , we determine the forces needed to execute the strategy , before finally forging the budgets needed to build and maintain the forces .
wsj_0692	7	These procedures consume millions of man-hours of labor and produce tons of paper , and each year , their end product -- the Five Year Defense Plan -- promptly melts away .
wsj_0692	8	The graph on the left shows how this happens see accompanying illustration -- WSJ Oct. 30 , 1989 .
wsj_0692	9	Compare the past eight five-year plans with actual appropriations .
wsj_0692	10	The Pentagon 's strategists produce budgets that simply can not be executed because they assume a defense strategy depends only on goals and threats .
wsj_0692	11	Strategy , however , is about possibilities , not hopes and dreams .
wsj_0692	12	By ignoring costs , U.S. strategists abdicate their responsibility for hard decisions .
wsj_0692	13	That puts the real strategic decisions in the hands of others : bean counters , budgeteers , and pork-barrelers .
wsj_0692	14	These people have different agendas .
wsj_0692	15	And as a result -- as the recent vote by the House to undo Mr. Cheney 's program terminations suggests -- the preservation of jobs is becoming the real goal of defense `` strategy . ''
wsj_0692	16	How can we turn this situation around ?
wsj_0692	17	Reform starts in the Pentagon .
wsj_0692	18	Strategists should consider the impact of budget uncertainties at the beginning of the planning process .
wsj_0692	19	They ought to examine how a range of optimistic to pessimistic budget scenarios would change the defense program .
wsj_0692	20	They would then develop priorities by identifying the least painful program cuts as they moved from higher to lower budgets .
wsj_0692	21	They would also identify the best way to add programs , should the budget come in at higher levels .
wsj_0692	22	This kind of contingency analysis is common in war planning and business planning .
wsj_0692	23	There is no reason that it can not be done for defense planning .
wsj_0692	24	Two steps are necessary to translate this idea into action .
wsj_0692	25	Step 1 cleans up our books .
wsj_0692	26	Our five-year plan contains three accounting devices -- negative money , an above guidance management reserve and optimistic inflation estimates -- which understate the spending the Pentagon has committed itself to by almost $ 100 billion .
wsj_0692	27	Negative money was invented in 1988 to make the 1990-94 Five Year Defense Plan conform to the numbers in President Reagan 's final budget submission to Congress .
wsj_0692	28	That plan exceeded the numbers contained in his budget message by $ 45 billion .
wsj_0692	29	To make the books balance , as is required by law , somebody invented a new budget line item that simply subtracted $ 45 billion .
wsj_0692	30	It is known in the Pentagon as the `` negative wedge . ''
wsj_0692	31	The Pentagon argues that the negative wedge is the net effect of $ 22 billion in the as-yet unidentified procurement reductions that it intends to find in future years and $ 23 billion in an `` above guidance '' management reserve that accounts for undefined programs that will materialize in the future .
wsj_0692	32	The 1990 plan also assumes inflation will decline to 1.7 % by 1994 .
wsj_0692	33	Most forecasters , including those in the Congressional Budget Office , assume inflation will be in excess of 4 % in each of those five years .
wsj_0692	34	At that rate , the defense plan is underfunded by $ 48 billion .
wsj_0692	35	By adding the negative wedge and recalculating the remaining program using a more probable inflation estimate , we arrive at a baseline program costing $ 1.7 trillion between 1990 and 1994 .
wsj_0692	36	Step 2 examines how four progressively lower budget scenarios would change the baseline and how these changes would affect our national security .
wsj_0692	37	The graph on the right which assumes a 4 % rate of inflation , places these scenarios in the context of recent appropriations see accompanying illustration -- WSJ Oct. 30 , 1989 .
wsj_0692	38	Note how the baseline program assumes a sharp increase in future appropriations .
wsj_0692	39	Step 2 will answer the question : What happens if these increases do not materialize ?
wsj_0692	40	Scenario 1 , known as the `` Constant Dollar Freeze , '' reimburses the Pentagon for inflation only -- it slopes upward at 4 % per year .
wsj_0692	41	This scenario has been the rough position of the U.S. Senate since 1985 , and it reduces the baseline by $ 106 billion between 1990 and 1994 .
wsj_0692	42	Scenario 3 , the `` Current Dollar Freeze , '' has been the approximate position of the House of Representatives for about four years .
wsj_0692	43	It freezes the budget at its current level , and forces the Pentagon to eat the effects of inflation until 1994 .
wsj_0692	44	This reduces the baseline by $ 229 billion .
wsj_0692	45	Scenario 2 extends the recent compromises between the House and the Senate ; it splits the difference between Scenarios 1 and 3 , by increasing the budget at 2 % per year .
wsj_0692	46	It reduces the baseline by $ 169 billion .
wsj_0692	47	Finally , Scenario 4 reduces the budget by 2 % per year for the next five years -- a total reduction of $ 287 billion .
wsj_0692	48	This can be thought of as a pessimistic prediction , perhaps driven by the sequestering effects of the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law or possibly a relaxation of tensions with the Soviet Union .
wsj_0692	49	The strategic planners in the Joint Chiefs of Staff would construct the most effective defense program for each scenario , maximizing strengths and minimizing weaknesses .
wsj_0692	50	They would conclude their efforts by producing a comprehensive net assessment for each plan -- including the assumptions made , an analysis of its deficiencies and limitations , the impact on national security , and the best strategy for working around these limitations .
wsj_0692	51	This exercise would reveal the true cost of a particular program by forcing the strategists to make hard decisions .
wsj_0692	52	If , for example , they choose to keep the B-2 Stealth bomber , they would have to sacrifice more and more other programs -- such as carrier battlegroups or army divisions -- as they moved toward lower budget levels .
wsj_0692	53	These trade-offs would evolve priorities by revealing when the cost of the B-2 became prohibitive .
wsj_0692	54	Some may be tempted to argue that the idea of a strategic review merely resurrects the infamous Zero-Based Budgeting ZBB concept of the Carter administration .
wsj_0692	55	But ZBB did not involve the strategic planners in the Joint Chiefs of Staff , and therefore degenerated into a bean-counting drill driven by budget politics .
wsj_0692	56	Anyway , ZBB 's procedures were so cumbersome that everyone involved was crushed under a burden of marginalia .
wsj_0692	57	A strategic review is fundamentally different .
wsj_0692	58	It would be run by the joint chiefs under simple directions : Produce the best possible force for each budget scenario and provide the Secretary of Defense with a comprehensive net assessment of how that force could be used to achieve U.S. goals .
wsj_0692	59	It might be feared that even thinking about lower budgets will hurt national security because the door will be opened to opportunistic budget cutting by an irresponsible Congress .
wsj_0692	60	This argument plays well in the atmosphere of gaming and mistrust permeating the Pentagon and Congress , and unfortunately , there is some truth to it .
wsj_0692	61	But in the end , it must be rejected for logical as well as moral reasons .
wsj_0692	62	To say that the Pentagon should act irresponsibly because acting responsibly will provoke Congress into acting irresponsibly leads to the conclusion that the Pentagon should deliberately exaggerate its needs in the national interest ; in other words , that it is justified in committing a crime -- lying to Congress -- because it is morally superior .
wsj_0692	63	Strategy is not a game between the Pentagon and Congress ; it is the art of the possible in a world where constraints force us to choose between unpleasant or imperfect alternatives .
wsj_0692	64	If we want meaningful priorities , we must understand the trade-offs they imply before we make commitments .
wsj_0692	65	Strategy is not a separate event in an idealized sequence of discrete events ; it is a way of thinking that neutralizes threats to our interests in a manner consistent with our financial , cultural and physical limitations .

wsj_0693	0	Although bullish dollar sentiment has fizzled , many currency analysts say a massive sell-off probably wo n't occur in the near future .
wsj_0693	1	While Wall Street 's tough times and lower U.S. interest rates continue to undermine the dollar , weakness in the pound and the yen is expected to offset those factors .
wsj_0693	2	`` By default , '' the dollar probably will be able to hold up pretty well in coming days , says Francoise Soares-Kemp , a foreign-exchange adviser at Credit Suisse .
wsj_0693	3	`` We 're close to the bottom '' of the near-term ranges , she contends .
wsj_0693	4	In late Friday afternoon New York trading , the dollar was at 1.8300 marks and 141.65 yen , off from late Thursday 's 1.8400 marks and 142.10 yen .
wsj_0693	5	The pound strengthened to $ 1.5795 from $ 1.5765 .
wsj_0693	6	In Tokyo Monday , the U.S. currency opened for trading at 141.70 yen , down from Friday 's Tokyo close of 142.75 yen .
wsj_0693	7	The dollar began Friday on a firm note , gaining against all major currencies in Tokyo dealings and early European trading despite reports that the Bank of Japan was seen unloading dollars around 142.70 yen .
wsj_0693	8	The rise came as traders continued to dump the pound after the sudden resignation Thursday of British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson .
wsj_0693	9	But once the pound steadied with help from purchases by the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , the dollar was dragged down , traders say , by the stock-market slump that left the Dow Jones Industrial Average with a loss of 17.01 points .
wsj_0693	10	With the stock market wobbly and dollar buyers discouraged by signs of U.S. economic weakness and the recent decline in U.S. interest rates that has diminished the attractiveness of dollar-denominated investments , traders say the dollar is still in a precarious position .
wsj_0693	11	`` They 'll be looking at levels to sell the dollar , '' says James Scalfaro , a foreign-exchange marketing representative at Bank of Montreal .
wsj_0693	12	While some analysts say the dollar eventually could test support at 1.75 marks and 135 yen , Mr. Scalfaro and others do n't see the currency decisively sliding under support at 1.80 marks and 140 yen soon .
wsj_0693	13	Predictions for limited dollar losses are based largely on the pound 's weak state after Mr. Lawson 's resignation and the yen 's inability to strengthen substantially when there are dollar retreats .
wsj_0693	14	With the pound and the yen lagging behind other major currencies , `` you do n't have a confirmation '' that a sharp dollar downturn is in the works , says Mike Malpede , senior currency analyst at Refco Inc. in Chicago .
wsj_0693	15	As far as the pound goes , some traders say a slide toward support at $ 1.5500 may be a favorable development for the dollar this week .
wsj_0693	16	While the pound has attempted to stabilize , currency analysts say it is in critical condition .
wsj_0693	17	Sterling plunged about four cents Thursday and hit the week 's low of $ 1.5765 when Mr. Lawson resigned from his six-year post because of a policy squabble with other cabinet members .
wsj_0693	18	He was succeeded by John Major , who Friday expressed a desire for a firm pound and supported the relatively high British interest rates that he said `` are working exactly as intended '' in reducing inflation .
wsj_0693	19	But the market remains uneasy about Mr. Major 's policy strategy and the prospects for the pound , currency analysts contend .
wsj_0693	20	Although the Bank of England 's tight monetary policy has fueled worries that Britain 's slowing economy is headed for a recession , it is widely believed that Mr. Lawson 's willingness to prop up the pound with interest-rate increases helped stem pound selling in recent weeks .
wsj_0693	21	If there are any signs that Mr. Major will be less inclined to use interest-rate boosts to rescue the pound from another plunge , that currency is expected to fall sharply .
wsj_0693	22	`` It 's fair to say there are more risks for the pound under Major than there were under Lawson , '' says Malcolm Roberts , a director of international bond market research at Salomon Brothers in London .
wsj_0693	23	`` There 's very little upside to sterling , '' Mr. Roberts says , but he adds that near-term losses may be small because the selling wave that followed Mr. Major 's appointment apparently has run its course .
wsj_0693	24	But some other analysts have a stormier forecast for the pound , particularly because Britain 's inflation is hovering at a relatively lofty annual rate of about 7.6 % and the nation is burdened with a struggling government and large current account and trade deficits .
wsj_0693	25	The pound likely will fall in coming days and may trade as low as 2.60 marks within the next year , says Nigel Rendell , an international economist at James Capel & Co. in London .
wsj_0693	26	The pound was at 2.8896 marks late Friday , off sharply from 2.9511 in New York trading a week earlier .
wsj_0693	27	If the pound falls closer to 2.80 marks , the Bank of England may raise Britain 's base lending rate by one percentage point to 16 % , says Mr. Rendell .
wsj_0693	28	But such an increase , he says , could be viewed by the market as `` too little too late . ''
wsj_0693	29	The Bank of England indicated its desire to leave its monetary policy unchanged Friday by declining to raise the official 15 % discount-borrowing rate that it charges discount houses , analysts say .
wsj_0693	30	Pound concerns aside , the lack of strong buying interest in the yen is another boon for the dollar , many traders say .
wsj_0693	31	The dollar has a `` natural base of support '' around 140 yen because the Japanese currency has n't been purchased heavily in recent weeks , says Ms. Soares-Kemp of Credit Suisse .
wsj_0693	32	The yen 's softness , she says , apparently stems from Japanese investors ' interest in buying dollars against the yen to purchase U.S. bond issues and persistent worries about this year 's upheaval in the Japanese government .
wsj_0693	33	On New York 's Commodity Exchange Friday , gold for current delivery jumped $ 5.80 , to $ 378.30 an ounce , the highest settlement since July 12 .

wsj_0693	35	In early trading in Hong Kong Monday , gold was quoted at $ 378.87 an ounce .
wsj_0694	0	We are deeply disturbed that a recent editorial stated that the `` Americans With Disabilities Act of 1989 '' was `` crafted primarily by Democratic Senators Kennedy and Harkin '' with a premise `` based on the presumption that most Americans are hostile to the disabled ... . ''
wsj_0694	1	Perhaps even more offensive is the statement , `` It is surprising that George Bush and the White House inner circle would ally themselves with this crabby philosophy . ''
wsj_0694	2	This legislation was not drafted by a handful of Democratic `` do-gooders . ''
wsj_0694	3	Quite the contrary -- it results from years of work by members of the National Council on the Handicapped , all appointed by President Reagan .
wsj_0694	4	You depict the bill as something Democratic leaders `` hoodwinked '' the administration into endorsing .
wsj_0694	5	The opposite is true : It 's the product of many meetings with administration officials , Senate staffers , advocates , and business and transportation officials .
wsj_0694	6	Many congressmen are citing the compromise on the `` Americans With Disabilities Act of 1989 '' as a model for bipartisan deliberations .
wsj_0694	7	Most National Council members are themselves disabled or are parents of children with disabilities .

wsj_0723	0	European Community employers fear that the EC Commission 's plans for a `` charter of fundamental social rights '' is a danger to industrial competitiveness .
wsj_0723	1	`` We do n't want Brussels deciding conditions for workers unless they are necessary and useful , '' said Zygmunt Tyszkiewicz , secretary general of the employers ' confederation Unice .
wsj_0723	2	Unice -- an acronym for the Union of Industrial and Employers ' Confederations of Europe -- fears that the charter will force EC countries to adopt a single pattern in labor relations .
wsj_0723	3	Workers and management , Mr. Tyszkiewicz said , would lose the `` flexibility and diversity '' that has so far allowed them to adapt to local conditions and traditions .
wsj_0723	4	The British government also strongly opposes the charter in its current form .
wsj_0723	5	It argues , as does Unice , that labor relations are best left to be regulated at the national level .
wsj_0723	6	France will propose a slightly watered-down version of the charter to be discussed by EC social-affairs ministers on Monday , officials said .
wsj_0723	7	But the cosmetic changes are n't expected to win over Britain .
wsj_0723	8	`` We still have serious differences with the text , '' a British official said , because it provides for a `` regulation of the labor market . ''
wsj_0723	9	Mr. Tyszkiewicz said the charter would put poorer EC countries such as Spain , Greece and Portugal at a disadvantage .
wsj_0723	10	It would force these countries to introduce minimum standards for pay and working hours , and provide for collective bargaining and worker `` participation '' in major corporate decisions .
wsj_0723	11	This , he warned , would prevent these countries from bridging the difference with their richer EC brethren .
wsj_0723	12	Indeed , lower wages -- in Greece , they are a third of the EC average -- are n't enough to offset higher transport costs and lower productivity in the southern countries .
wsj_0723	13	Increasing labor costs , Mr. Tyszkiewicz argued , would only put the countries at a further disadvantage in competing in the barrier-free EC market planned for after 1992 .
wsj_0723	14	But the Unice official said that producing a charter acceptable to both Britain and European industry is n't an unattainable goal .
wsj_0723	15	The charter would just have to be restricted to a list of workers ' fundamental rights , without seeking to impose any norms .
wsj_0723	16	A key provision in the current version of the charter would give the commission a mandate to produce an `` action program '' detailing on what points EC member states would be required to comply with the goals set out in the charter .
wsj_0723	17	This provision lies at the heart of the British and Unice fears of `` social engineering '' by the commission .
wsj_0723	18	One possible political solution , an EC official said , would be for the commission to present the action program in late November , before the adoption of the charter at a summit of EC governments on Dec. 8 and 9 .
wsj_0723	19	This would leave Britain free to adopt the charter after having rebutted the action program .
wsj_0723	20	The charter was approved by the EC Commission on Sept. 21 .
wsj_0723	21	France 's Socialist government , which currently holds the council 's rotating presidency , is committed to having the charter adopted by all 12 EC states before the end of 1989 -- the bicentennial of the French revolution and its `` Universal Declaration of Human Rights .

wsj_0727	1	Such an offer could torpedo a plan by Lion Nathan Ltd. of New Zealand to acquire half the brewing interests .
wsj_0727	2	But it would probably increase the amount of cash that debt-ridden Bond Corp. would earn from the transaction .
wsj_0727	3	Australia 's National Companies and Securities Commission said it will allow S.A. Brewing to acquire an option on as much as 20 % of Bell Resources Ltd. , a unit of Bond Corp. that is in the process of acquiring Bond Corp. 's brewing businesses for 2.5 billion Australian dollars US$ 1.93 billion .
wsj_0727	4	S.A. Brewing , which is 20%-owned by Elders IXL Ltd. , Australia 's largest brewer , will make a takeover offer for all of Bell Resources if it exercises the option , the corporate regulators said in a statement .

wsj_0728	0	Contrary to what might be expected based on the headline on John R. Dorfman 's recent Money Matters article `` Pros Hit Theorists Right Where It Hurts '' Oct. 3 , I was able to stand proudly before my undergraduate finance students and proclaim that the findings of your yearlong experiment on stock picking is completely consistent with what they have been taught in the classroom .
wsj_0728	1	In particular , I do not find the fact that your group of pros ' monthly selections of four stocks outperforms the market in general to be inconsistent with market efficiency .
wsj_0728	2	Mr. Dorfman states that an investor who invested $ 100,000 a year ago in the first four stocks selected by your pros and then sold those one month later , purchasing the four new pro picks , and repeated this process for the year would have accumulated $ 166,537 , excluding account dividends , taxes and commissions .
wsj_0728	3	In contrast , an investor holding the Dow Jones portfolio over the year would have accumulated only $ 127,446 .
wsj_0728	4	Accepted theories of asset pricing offer a perfectly legitimate explanation .
wsj_0728	5	Accepted theories state that investors require higher returns on riskier investments .
wsj_0728	6	Thus , rather than seeing the excess returns to the pro-selected portfolio as being abnormal , I see those returns as simply compensations for taking on added risk .
wsj_0728	7	I believe the risk for each individual stock selected by your pros is very large .
wsj_0728	8	If you asked me to select a stock with the highest expected return , I would select a stock with the greatest amount of undiversifiable risk , as I am sure your pros do .
wsj_0728	9	Your hypothetical investor is simply being compensated for taking on this added risk .
wsj_0728	10	Moreover , your hypothetical investor has forsaken the gains to be had in reducing risk by diversifying his portfolio .
wsj_0728	11	A four-stock portfolio is still exposed to a great deal of unnecessary risk .
wsj_0728	12	This means the returns can vary a great deal .
wsj_0728	13	Mr. Dorfman provides confirming evidence of this phenomenon when he reports that your staff of dart throwers would have accumulated only $ 112,383 by randomly selecting four new stocks to be held in a portfolio each month .
wsj_0728	14	Scott E. Hein Texas Tech University Lubbock , Texas Your Investment Dartboard article misses the target .
wsj_0728	15	The fact that stock pickers have bested a randomly selected portfolio in eight of 12 months has no bearing on the efficient-market theory .
wsj_0728	16	What matters is that the stocks recommended by your pros tend to be substantially riskier than a diversified portfolio .
wsj_0728	17	For example , your pickers ' recommendations for the coming month are , on average , 22.5 % riskier than holding the market portfolio according to Value Line 's Beta estimates .
wsj_0728	18	James Morgan 's pick for October -- Dynascan -- is a substantial 35 % riskier than the market portfolio ; his lauded Thermo Electron pick is 40 % riskier .

wsj_0732	0	Why do you continually ignore the salubrious effects of indexing the basis of capital gains for inflation ?
wsj_0732	1	Why do you maintain the House-passed capital-gains plan is a `` temporary '' reduction when it is not ?
wsj_0732	2	I think the reason is that you are confusing tax `` rates '' with tax `` payments . ''
wsj_0732	3	Your Sept. 29 page-one story on the House-passed capital-gains plan is a good example .
wsj_0732	4	You lead readers to believe that the House reduced the capital-gains tax for two years only .
wsj_0732	5	You virtually ignore the tax-reducing power of indexation , which in many cases is more substantial than a lower rate .
wsj_0732	6	The monetary tax benefit of indexation for all gains in excess of inflation can be measured using the following equation : tax rate , times inflation rate , times basis for the gain .
wsj_0732	7	Depending on the size of the gain and the rate of inflation , indexation can mean a lower tax payment than using the 19.6 % rate without indexation .
wsj_0732	8	But in any event -- and this is the important point -- tax `` payments '' on capital gains will be lower with indexation than under current law , even though the tax `` rate '' is the same under both systems .
wsj_0732	9	As you can see , the capital-gains reduction plan adopted by the House would not be temporary , but permanent .
wsj_0732	10	I hope that you begin talking about the plan 's permanent and , in my view , most beneficial feature -- indexation .
wsj_0732	11	Rep. Robert K. Dornan R. , Calif . Washington
wsj_0732	12	That the motivation for the two-year reduction to 19.6 % is budgetary does not mean it is not in the public interest .
wsj_0732	13	The reduction eases the burden on portfolio changes and frees capital to seek more productive or more appropriate uses .
wsj_0732	14	But what is really significant is the indexation of capital gains after 1991 .
wsj_0732	15	To argue that this is `` not likely '' to affect the economy in positive ways is contrary both to recent experience with capital-gains tax cuts and to common sense .
wsj_0732	16	A large part of the long-term appreciation of assets reflects inflation , and the taxation of inflation-created capital gains is confiscation .
wsj_0732	17	Does the Journal really believe that people ignore the prospect of having a substantial part of their capital confiscated when they decide whether to save or how to invest ?
wsj_0732	18	Under current law , it is not financially rational to forgo consumption .
wsj_0732	19	Real , aftertax returns from financial assets are on the order of 1 % or 2 % a year .
wsj_0732	20	The capital-gains tax reform is a step toward correcting one of the gravest structural weaknesses of the U.S. economy , the closely connected phenomena of low savings rates , weak capital formation and high capital costs .

wsj_0735	0	The Financial Accounting Standards Board said it will soon issue a rule requiring disclosure about the financial risk of certain financial instruments .
wsj_0735	1	But the chief rule-making body for accountants backed off one part of its original proposal made earlier this year that would have required a breakdown of certain balance-sheet items related to off-balance sheet instruments .
wsj_0735	2	The balance-sheet detail was opposed by many banks and thrifts that felt the cost of supplying such data was n't worth the value of the disclosures .
wsj_0735	3	Under the initial proposal , for example , banks would have been required to disclose that portion of allowances for loan losses that reflects specific letters of credit for which customers had defaulted .
wsj_0735	4	The final rule wo n't require such a breakdown of the allowances for loan losses , which appears on the balance sheet .
wsj_0735	5	The FASB rule will cover such financial instruments as interest rate swaps , financial guarantees , foward interest rate contracts , loan contracts , loan commitments and options written on securites held .
wsj_0735	6	It will require companies to spell out in more detail collateral polices and concentrations of credit risk for all financial instruments .
wsj_0735	7	The rule will require companies with financial instruments that have off-balance sheet risks to disclose data about the value and terms of the instruments , any accounting loss that would occur if the outside party involved in the instrument failed to perform , and the company 's policy for requiring collateral or other security for the instrument .
wsj_0735	8	Scott Miller , an FASB project manager , said that a final rule will be issued before year end .
wsj_0735	9	But he noted that the initial effective date of the earlier proposal had been delayed by six months .
wsj_0736	0	Poughkeepsie Savings Bank said a plan to sell its South Carolina branch offices to First Citizens Bank , of Columbia , S.C. , fell through .
wsj_0736	1	Poughkeepsie also expects to post a one-time charge of $ 8.3 million , resulting in a net loss for the third quarter .
wsj_0736	2	The charge represents a write-down of the goodwill associated with Poughkeepsie 's investment in the banks it is trying to sell and its North Carolina branches as well .
wsj_0736	3	The thrift announced the plan Aug. 21 .
wsj_0736	4	Among other reasons , high fees regulators imposed on certain transfers of thrift deposits to commercial banks `` substantially altered the economics of the transaction for both parties , '' Poughkeepsie said .
wsj_0736	5	Additionally , the bank is increasing its loan-loss reserves for the third quarter by $ 8.5 million before taxes .
wsj_0736	6	In the year-earlier third quarter , Poughkeepsie Savings had net income of $ 2.8 million , or 77 cents a share .
wsj_0736	7	Poughkeepsie said it is continuing to try to sell itself , under a June agreement with a dissident-shareholder group .
wsj_0736	8	The bank also said its effort would continue past the Nov. 1 deadline set in that agreement and that the litigation between the two sides might resume as a result .
wsj_0736	9	The thrift and the holders had suspended their lawsuits as part of the agreement .

wsj_0739	0	A potentially safer whooping cough vaccine made by novel genetic engineering techniques was described by a team of Italian , U.S. and Japanese scientists .
wsj_0739	1	The team reported they managed to induce bacteria to produce a non-toxic version of the poisons produced by the bacterium that causes whooping cough .
wsj_0739	2	Laboratory tests showed that non-toxic versions of the poisons are capable of inducing an immunity to whooping cough , the researchers reported in this week 's issue of the journal Science .
wsj_0739	3	The current vaccine for whooping cough , or pertussis , is part of the `` DPT '' for diphtheria , pertussis , tetanus shot given most infants and young children .
wsj_0739	4	The vaccine is effective in preventing a disease that still afflicts about 60 million children a year world-wide , causing an estimated one million deaths .
wsj_0739	5	The vaccine , however , causes allergic reactions that can be fatal .
wsj_0739	6	The reactions stem from the fact that the vaccine contains multiple copies of the whole Bordetella pertussis bacterium , which causes whooping cough .
wsj_0739	7	This bacterium produces a toxin that , if used as a vaccine , can induce immunity to whooping cough .
wsj_0739	8	Unfortunately , the toxin is also poisonous .
wsj_0739	9	The Italian-led scientific team said they had succeeded in getting bacteria to produce a non-toxic version of the pertussis toxin , which could be used as a safe vaccine .
wsj_0739	10	The researchers reported they have been able to pluck the five genes that produced the toxin out of the pertussis bacterium .
wsj_0739	11	It turned out that although it took all five genes to produce the toxin , only one was responsible for the toxin 's virulence .
wsj_0739	12	Ordinarily in genetic engineering each of these genes , minus the one that caused the virulence , would have been transferred to another bacterium , called E. coli , which would then produce a nonvirulent version of the toxin .
wsj_0739	13	The researchers said they did this , but the toxin did n't induce immunity to whooping cough .
wsj_0739	14	The scientists then took the five toxin genes and triggered a mutation in the one gene that caused virulence .
wsj_0739	15	Then , using a new technique called homologous recombination for introducing genes into cells , they transferred all five genes to bacteria closely related to the pertussis organism .
wsj_0739	16	These bacterial `` cousins '' ordinarily do n't make the toxin .
wsj_0739	17	But the genes were accompanied by a piece of DNA , called a promoter , that turns the genes on .
wsj_0739	18	The new bacteria recipients of the genes began producing pertussis toxin which , because of the mutant virulence gene , was no longer toxic .
wsj_0739	19	Experiments showed that the new , non-virulent toxin is capable of inducing immunity , according to the researchers from the Selavo Research Center in Siena , Italy , the Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee and the Japanese National Institutes of Health .

wsj_0743	0	The European Community Commission challenged an agreement on routes and fares between France 's two largest airlines on antitrust grounds .
wsj_0743	1	Meeting in Strasbourg Wednesday , the commission voted , as expected , to formally object to the accord between Air France , the state-owned airline , and state-controlled domestic carrier Air Inter .
wsj_0743	2	An EC spokesman said the two companies will be notified so they can begin negotiations with Brussels on how to modify the pact .
wsj_0743	3	At issue is an accord dating back to March in which Air France gained access to five domestic French routes under Air Inter 's flight numbers and the domestic airline got to fly to five cities outside of France under the flag of Air France .
wsj_0743	4	The two shared results from this route swap , and followed rules on ticket pricing .
wsj_0743	5	The EC Commission decided that such an accord does n't benefit consumers enough to merit an exemption from antitrust law .
wsj_0743	6	The airlines presented it as offering consumers more choice and better flight connections .
wsj_0743	7	An Air France spokeswoman said , `` we 're absolutely ready to study all solutions . ''
wsj_0743	8	An Air Inter spokesman said , `` Because they the EC have doubts , we will work again on the text and the contents of the accord .
wsj_0744	0	A state appellate court reinstated the 1987 convictions of Pymm Thermometer Corp. and two of its executives on charges of assault for exposing workers to toxic mercury vapors .
wsj_0744	1	The indictment charged that Pymm operated a machine to crush broken thermometers and recover the mercury in an illegal workroom .
wsj_0744	2	The charges said that one worker suffered permanent brain damage from mercury exposure .
wsj_0744	3	The judge handling the case in state Supreme Court , a trial court , had tossed out the jury verdicts , ruling that the matter should have been handled under federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration rules .
wsj_0744	4	But the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court held that federal law did n't pre-empt the states from such a prosecution .
wsj_0744	5	Elizabeth Holtzman , district attorney for Brooklyn , N.Y. , said , `` The appellate division has agreed with our view that despite federal worker-safety laws , state prosecutors have the power to protect working people . ''
wsj_0744	6	Lawyers for the company and executives could n't be reached for comment .
wsj_0744	7	The executives face five to 15 years in prison and fines of $ 5,000 or double the profit made by failing to comply with the rules .

wsj_0746	0	Swedish rolling-steel and ball-bearing group AB SKF said its pretax profit rose 78 % to 1.78 billion kronor $ 278 million in the first nine months from one billion kronor $ 156 million in the corresponding period a year earlier .
wsj_0746	1	SKF said sales increased 17 % to 18.46 billion kronor from 15.72 billion .
wsj_0746	2	Earnings per share were 10.35 kronor compared with 5.80 kronor .
wsj_0746	3	SKF said demand for the group 's main product , rolling bearings , remained favorable in Europe , which accounts for slightly more than two-thirds of group sales .
wsj_0746	4	Latin American markets continued their recovery after a weak start to the year , SKF said .
wsj_0746	5	The company said the situation in the U.S. is still uncertain as reduced production in the country 's automotive industry has resulted in weakened demand for rolling bearings .
wsj_0746	6	Analysts said SKF 's results for the first nine months lived up to market expectations as brokerage firms had predicted a pretax profit of 1.74 billion to 1.86 billion kronor .
wsj_0746	7	The three business areas engaged in rolling bearing operations continued to show favorable sales development .
wsj_0746	8	Sales of rolling bearings increased 19 % to 15.7 billion kronor from 13.2 billion kronor in the corresponding period the previous year .
wsj_0747	0	We read with interest Robert Tomsho 's Sept. 28 page-one article on Robert Redford `` The Sundance Kid Gets Little Respect Around Sundance '' .
wsj_0747	1	Misunderstanding conversations with us , Mr. Tomsho argued that Mr. Redford 's environmental views are at odds with Utah residents .
wsj_0747	2	This may have been true 10 years ago , but times have changed , even in Utah .
wsj_0747	3	Mr. Redford no longer stands out as an extremist .
wsj_0747	4	He has not changed , but those around him have .
wsj_0747	5	Many of his views on the protection of wilderness areas , rivers and canyons are now embraced by mainstream , conservative Utahans .
wsj_0747	6	Recently , some 60 environmental and outdoor groups representing such divergent points of view as the Sierra Club , the League of Women Voters and the National Rifle Association joined together to request a reassessment of the environmentally unsound Central Utah Project .
wsj_0747	7	While Utah is not yet a haven for environmentalism , public views toward the environment have significantly improved .
wsj_0747	8	In one of the most conservative , Republican states in the entire nation , the greening of Robert Redford 's neighbors is the real story that Mr. Tomsho missed .
wsj_0747	9	Sammye Meadows Sam Rushforth Gary Bryner Heber City , Utah
wsj_0747	10	If Mr. Redford wanted to be accepted by the people of Utah , he should have taken an advisory role instead of one of forcing his personal preferences .
wsj_0747	11	Furthermore , his actions imply that it is too damaging or costly for society to provide jobs through power-plant construction , coal mining or to build roads for public safety because of the adverse impact on the environment , but it is just fine and dandy for him to transform a mountain high in the Wasatch Range into a ski resort .
wsj_0747	12	It astounds me he can rationalize his self-righteous and greedy actions in Utah .
wsj_0747	13	An excellent environmental actor he is .
wsj_0747	14	David Vranian M.B.A. Student University of Colorado Boulder , Colo .
wsj_0747	15	Mr. Redford , like it or not , is like a braking system on a runaway truck , kind of slowing it down into control .
wsj_0747	16	He 's rich , famous and intelligent , and has the time to do something that not even the federal government will do .
wsj_0747	17	Mr. Redford is slowing down a mindless , speeding maniac known as the progress of mankind .
wsj_0747	18	Personally , I 'm glad there are people like him around to slow down the profit takers , and those who are in such a blind hurry for something that may appear to benefit them in the immediate future , not caring about the long-range implications .
wsj_0749	0	In 1987 , the Presidents Commission of the NCAA , which oversees most U.S. intercollegiate sports , contracted with the Washington-based American Institutes for Research to do a survey on the college experiences of what the body chooses to call student-athletes .
wsj_0749	1	A brief `` executive summary '' was issued last April , and attracted some , but not much , attention .
wsj_0749	2	More-detailed reports followed , and attracted even less notice .
wsj_0749	3	I suspect I may be one of the few people to have read them all .
wsj_0749	4	The sixth and last report now is out , and it puts the effort in perspective .
wsj_0749	5	Titled `` Comments From Students , '' it focuses on the real shame of college sports : what happens to young athletes once they enter academe .
wsj_0749	6	It 's little less than a cry for help from those who make the costly show possible .
wsj_0749	7	The previous five reports were mainly statistical , but clear enough in outline .
wsj_0749	8	They showed that participants in Division I football and men 's basketball , the big-time `` revenue sports , '' entered school with poorer high-school grades and test scores than `` minor-sport '' jocks and students who participated in other extracurricular activities , and they got lower grades once they got there , at least partly because of the athletic demands placed on them .
wsj_0749	9	The football and basketball players spent more time on their sports in season than they did on class attendance and homework combined 30 hours a week versus 25.3 .
wsj_0749	10	Almost half 49.8 % reported suffering `` mental abuse '' from coaches , and almost one-quarter 24.8 % said they had been pressured to ignore injuries .
wsj_0749	11	But even those numbers do n't describe the situation as well as the athletes do in their own words .
wsj_0749	12	The composite portrait that emerges is n't of a pampered jock marking time until he can land a seven-figure pro contract -- he 's part of a tiny minority .
wsj_0749	13	Rather , it 's of a kid we 're talking about 17 to 22 year olds here having a tough time making the best of what will probably be his one shot at college .
wsj_0749	14	The pertinent question , coming at the end of a lengthy , confidential questionnaire , was this : `` Are there things about your college life you would like to tell us that we did n't ask about ? ''
wsj_0749	15	Of the almost 3,000 athletes surveyed , 1,240 took the time to respond .
wsj_0749	16	Here are a few of their answers : -- `` They say that I am a student-athlete , but really I 'm an athlete-student .
wsj_0749	17	They lied to me on the recruiting trip .
wsj_0749	18	Football is the No. 1 thing here '' .
wsj_0749	19	-- Junior football player .
wsj_0749	20	-- `` Being a student-athlete at college is a lot different from high school .
wsj_0749	21	First , the sport you play is no longer a game -- it becomes a job .
wsj_0749	22	Your coaches demand a lot more out of you even though some of them are not willing to take the time to watch you progress .
wsj_0749	23	Your interest is not taken to heart because people only care about your performance '' .
wsj_0749	24	-- Freshman basketball player .
wsj_0749	25	-- `` The coaches should have a more personal and sympathetic attitude toward the athletes -- not treat us like pieces of meat .
wsj_0749	26	They always say to get a degree first , but they do n't allow us time or to skip practice to study for a test .
wsj_0749	27	They just want to get their job done at any cost to the athlete '' .
wsj_0749	28	-- Freshman football player .
wsj_0749	29	-- `` The pressure put on us to win at all times has resulted in physical violence , such as punching and slapping by coaches .

wsj_0749	33	-- `` Playing intercollegiate sports does n't give you a lot of time to spend with others .

wsj_0749	45	-- `` More often than not , college athletes go through college never really experiencing collegiate life to the fullest .

wsj_0749	47	-- Sophomore basketball player .
wsj_0749	48	-- `` Somehow , and I do n't know how , the game needs to be played for fun again , and not for the big bowl revenues or lucrative TV contracts '' .
wsj_0749	49	-- Graduate-student football player .
wsj_0749	50	There have been rumblings that , at long last , changes may be in the works .
wsj_0749	51	The Knight Foundation , of Akron , Ohio , has established a national commission to look into college-sports reform , and the NCAA Presidents Commission earlier this month recommended cutting spring football practice in half , moving the start of basketball practice back by a month and reducing maximum schedules in that sport to 25 games from 28 .
wsj_0749	52	The key word in that paragraph , though , is `` may . ''
wsj_0749	53	NCAA Executive Director Richard Schultz , in accepting a place on the Knight Commission , urged that the panel take a `` balanced '' view , which looks for all the world like a plea not to rock the boat too much , and the presidents ' recommendations could face considerable opposition at the NCAA 's full convention in January , which will vote on them .
wsj_0749	54	I read that one unnamed athletics director predicted that the basketball-cutback proposal could fail because of `` real world '' i.e. , economic considerations .
wsj_0749	55	But the `` real world '' also includes the unpleasant truth that colleges are cheating the athletes they have wooed and won .
wsj_0749	56	If they wo n't change their ways voluntarily , maybe somebody bigger -- Congress -- should make them .
wsj_0750	0	They want late-night shuttles to the biology labs .
wsj_0750	1	They want a 24-hour library .
wsj_0750	2	And like college radicals everywhere , they are talking about a demonstration -- where protesters would gather quietly near the science building and raise their hands , classroom style .
wsj_0750	3	Such is the fiber of the wool that woolly intellectuals let fly at gatherings of Harvard University 's new Society of Nerds and Geeks , or SONG .
wsj_0750	4	SONGsters are mad as heck about campus anti-intellectualism and they are n't going to take it anymore , at least not without trying a few really neat ideas first .
wsj_0750	5	`` We could have called ourselves the Academic Intellectual Society , but then everyone would have said , ` Oh , you mean the nerd-and-geek club , ' '' Leonid Fridman , SONG 's graduate-student adviser , told 19 attendees at the club 's inaugural meeting earlier this month .
wsj_0750	6	Membership has since swelled to between 20 and 25 .
wsj_0750	7	Some people may think of nerds as calculator-toting , socially awkward individuals with shirt-pocket liners for their pencils and a preoccupation with computers and matters numerical .
wsj_0750	8	Geeks , by at least one definition , are chicken-mutilating circus freaks .
wsj_0750	9	But SONG founder Jeremy Kahn , a Harvard junior , thinks of nerds and geeks more as `` nonconformists , '' albeit with a studious bent .
wsj_0750	10	One of the group 's first projects is a `` procrastination hot line '' that students could call when they have an urge to delay studying .
wsj_0750	11	The club plans to show nerdy movies , such as `` Real Genius , '' in which physics whizzes pop corn with lasers ; and naturally , the `` Revenge of the Nerds , '' a tale of college males with runny noses and ill-fitting pants .
wsj_0750	12	One of its `` more ambitious goals '' is to get Jaime Escalante , the Los Angeles high-school mathematics teacher featured in the film `` Stand and Deliver , '' to come to Harvard for a guest lecture .
wsj_0750	13	Nerds and geeks sometimes find themselves a bit isolated at Harvard .
wsj_0750	14	So Mr. Kahn says high priority is being given to creating a computerized matchmaking service `` where instead of being matched for eye color , you could be matched for similar intellectual interests . ''
wsj_0750	15	`` I 'm a math major , but I want to know about psychobiology .
wsj_0750	16	Hopefully , I 'd find someone in psychobiology who wanted to know more about mathematics . ''
wsj_0750	17	Meanwhile , finding a volunteer to write the computer program is n't a problem .

wsj_0759	0	Southam Inc. said its unprofitable weekly newspaper , The Financial Times of Canada , is up for sale .
wsj_0759	1	Analysts said the announcement , the latest in a series of divestitures and restructuring moves , is aimed at improving Southam 's earnings before the expiration in June of a standstill pact with Torstar Corp .
wsj_0759	2	When that agreement expires , Torstar will be free to increase its 22.4 % stake in Southam , or to make an offer for the whole company .
wsj_0759	3	Descendants of the Southam family hold an additional 22.6 % stake in the Toronto-based company , Canada 's largest newspaper publisher .
wsj_0759	4	The newspaper could fetch between 15 million and 20 million Canadian dollars US$ 12.8 million to $ 17.1 million , said one analyst , who asked not to be identified .
wsj_0759	5	A spokesman for Southam declined to comment on the price the company is seeking or on estimates of the paper 's annual losses , which most analysts place at between C$ 4 million and C$ 7 million .
wsj_0759	6	Yesterday , Southam reported third-quarter earnings of C$ 10.8 million on revenue of C$ 395.4 million , down from C$ 14.6 million on revenue of C$ 389.6 million in the year-ago quarter .
wsj_0759	7	`` To be profitable , the paper requires more circulation and building circulation is an expensive undertaking , '' said John Macfarlane , the paper 's publisher .
wsj_0759	8	Southam said the level of future investment required by the paper would have restricted its options in other areas .
wsj_0759	9	The acquisition of the Financial Times of Canada is `` well within reach for any number of media companies , both public and private , '' said James Cole , an analyst with Toronto-based BBN James Capel Inc .
wsj_0759	10	Possible bidders include Christopher Ondaatje , a Toronto financier and vice chairman of Hees International Bancorp Inc. , a holding company controlled by Toronto 's Bronfman family .
wsj_0759	11	Mr. Ondaatje sold his stake in Pagurian Corp. to Hees earlier this year and is said to be seeking a media acquisition .
wsj_0759	12	Mr. Ondaatje could n't be reached for comment , but Roy Mac-Laren , chairman of CB Media , a closely held concern that publishes two business magazines , said his company would take a close look at the newspaper .
wsj_0759	13	Mr. Cole said the sale of the 77-year Financial Times , which Southam has owned since 1961 , is consistent with Southam 's strategy of cutting costs to obtain maximum profits from its operations while disposing of `` chronically under-performing '' assets .
wsj_0759	14	Southam agreed to sell its 47 % stake in Selkirk Communications Ltd. , a broadcasting concern , to Maclean Hunter Ltd. for about C$ 285 million last year .
wsj_0759	15	This year , it has moved to cut costs in its newspaper division through layoffs and asset sales , while reaching joint venture and acquisition agreements in other areas .
wsj_0759	16	The Financial Times of Canada has no links to the British daily newspaper , The Financial Times .
wsj_0760	0	Norton Co. said net income for the third quarter fell 6 % to $ 20.6 million , or 98 cents a share , from $ 22 million , or $ 1.03 a share .
wsj_0760	1	Operating profit for the abrasives , engineering materials and petroleum services concern was $ 19.2 million , or 91 cents a share , up 3 % from $ 18.7 million , or 87 cents a share .
wsj_0760	2	The company had a tax credit of $ 1.4 million .
wsj_0760	3	In the year-earlier quarter , the tax credit was $ 3.3 million .
wsj_0760	4	Sales rose 8 % to $ 368.5 million from $ 340.7 million .
wsj_0760	5	Operating profit in the company 's abrasives segment rose 16 % while operating profit in the engineering materials segment rose 2 % .
wsj_0760	6	However , the company 's petroleum services segment , while profitable , was hurt by high financing costs associated with the company 's buy-out of a 50 % stake in Eastman Christensen Co. from Texas Eastern Corp. last June .
wsj_0760	7	Norton and Texas Eastern had each held a 50 % stake in Eastman in a joint venture .
wsj_0760	8	Norton announced earlier this month that it was exploring the possible sale of all or part of Eastman Christensen .
wsj_0760	9	For the nine months , Norton had net of $ 81.2 million , or $ 3.87 a share , and a tax credit of $ 4.4 million .
wsj_0760	10	In the year-earlier period , the company had net of $ 77.2 million , or $ 3.68 a share , and a tax credit of $ 7.7 million .
wsj_0760	11	Norton had operating profit of $ 76.8 million , or $ 3.66 a share , up 11 % from $ 69.5 million , or $ 3.31 a share .
wsj_0760	12	Sales rose 8 % to $ 1.15 billion from $ 1.06 billion .
wsj_0762	0	CAMBREX Corp. , Bayonne , N.J. , declared its initial quarterly of five cents a share , payable Dec. 1 to stock of record Nov. 10 .
wsj_0762	1	The maker of specialty chemicals has about 5.9 million shares outstanding .
wsj_0762	2	The company said the move recognizes its strong financial position .
wsj_0762	3	Although profits were `` squeezed '' in 1989 , mainly as a result of higher raw-material costs , the company said it is confident about future earnings and cash flow for 1990 and beyond .
wsj_0762	4	In national over-the-counter trading yesterday , Cambrex shares rose 50 cents to close at $ 13 a share .
wsj_0763	0	The Justice Department said it is seeking to join a private lawsuit challenging a Pittsburgh suburb 's zoning ordinance that sharply restricts the locations available to group homes for the handicapped .
wsj_0763	1	This would be the department 's first suit challenging a local zoning ordinance under 1988 amendments to the Fair Housing Act .
wsj_0763	2	Under those amendments , which took effect in March of this year , the federal government can intervene in private housing-discrimination lawsuits .
wsj_0763	3	The ordinance , in Moon Township , prohibits locating a group home for the handicapped within a mile of another such facility .
wsj_0763	4	In papers filed with the federal district court in Pittsburgh , the Justice Department alleged that the ordinance , by limiting the number of group homes that can be established in the township , makes housing unavailable on account of handicap .
wsj_0763	5	The private suit was brought by three mentally retarded people who live in a group home in Moon .
wsj_0763	6	Greg Smith , Moon Township manager , said the ordinance is intended to prevent the concentration of group homes for the mentally retarded from changing `` the character and flavor of the neighborhood . ''
wsj_0763	7	He said the ordinance also will benefit the mentally retarded .
wsj_0763	8	`` Our intent is to spread them out '' to insure they are well integrated into the community , he said .
wsj_0767	0	The Federal Communications Commission allowed American Telephone & Telegraph Co. to continue offering discount phone services for large-business customers and said it would soon re-examine its regulation of the long-distance market .
wsj_0767	1	The FCC moves were good news for AT&T , which has been striving since the breakup of the phone system for greater latitude in pricing and reduced regulation .
wsj_0767	2	Alfred Sikes , the new FCC chairman , championed deregulation of AT&T at his last job as head of a Commerce Department telecommunications agency .
wsj_0767	3	But it has been an open question whether Mr. Sikes , an extraordinarily cautious man , would continue pushing deregulation at the FCC in the face of what is likely to be great political pressure .
wsj_0767	4	`` It means that Sikes is serious about the deregulation of long distance , '' said Jack Grubman , a telecommunications analyst at PaineWebber Inc. , who attended the FCC meeting .
wsj_0767	5	`` All the commissioners were in amazing agreement to re-examine regulation for only having been together for a few months . ''
wsj_0767	6	The FCC took three specific actions regarding AT&T .
wsj_0767	7	By a 4-0 vote , it allowed AT&T to continue offering special discount packages to big customers , called Tariff 12 , rejecting appeals by AT&T competitors that the discounts were illegal .
wsj_0767	8	Then by a separate 4-0 vote , it chose the narrowest possible grounds to strike down a different discount plan , called Tariff 15 , that AT&T offered to Holiday Corp .
wsj_0767	9	AT&T gave a 5 % to 10 % discount to the Memphis , Tenn. , company that oversees Holiday Inns , in response to a similar discount offered to Holiday Corp. by MCI Communications Corp .
wsj_0767	10	The agency said that because MCI 's offer had expired AT&T could n't continue to offer its discount plan .
wsj_0767	11	But the agency specifically did n't rule whether AT&T had the right to match offers by competitors if that means giving discounts not generally available to other phone users .
wsj_0767	12	Indeed , Joe Nacchio , AT&T 's vice president for business-communications services , said AT&T offered a similar Tariff 15 discount to Resort Condominium International , of Indianapolis , to meet another MCI bid .
wsj_0767	13	The FCC `` did n't say I could n't do it again , '' he said .
wsj_0767	14	Apart from those two actions , Mr. Sikes and the three other commissioners said they expect to re-examine how AT&T is regulated since competition has increased .
wsj_0767	15	Richard Firestone , chief of the FCC 's common-carrier bureau , said he expected the agency to propose new rules next year .
wsj_0767	16	AT&T applauded the FCC 's actions .
wsj_0767	17	`` The time is long overdue to take a look at the fierce competition in the long-distance business and the rules governing it , '' the New York telecommunications firm said in a statement .
wsj_0767	18	But MCI , of Washington , was displeased with the FCC decision concerning Tariff 12 , arguing that `` AT&T can not be allowed to flaunt FCC rules . ''
wsj_0767	19	United Telecommunications Inc. 's US Sprint unit said it was `` obviously disappointed '' with the FCC decision on Tariff 12 .
wsj_0767	20	US Sprint said was it will petition the FCC decision in federal court .
wsj_0767	21	`` We believe that the court will find it unlawful , '' said a US Sprint spokesman .
wsj_0767	22	Separately , AT&T filed a countersuit against MCI accusing it of misleading consumers through allegedly `` false and deceptive '' advertising .
wsj_0767	23	The AT&T action was the most recent blow in a nasty fight .
wsj_0767	24	Earlier this month , MCI sued AT&T in federal district court , claiming that AT&T 's ads are false .
wsj_0767	25	AT&T assembled three of its top executives in Washington , all visibly angry , to try to refute MCI 's charges .
wsj_0767	26	`` MCI has made hawks out of the upper echelon of AT&T , '' said PaineWebber 's Mr. Grubman , who said he expected AT&T to become increasingly aggressive in dealing with its longtime nemesis .

wsj_0768	0	Billions of investors ' dollars are pouring out of the nation 's junk-bond mutual funds , undermining a pillar of support in the already reeling junk market .
wsj_0768	1	Last week alone , an eye-popping $ 1.6 billion flowed out of the junk funds , or nearly 5 % of their total assets , according to estimates by Dalbar Financial Services Inc. , a Boston research firm .
wsj_0768	2	In the past two months the nation 's 88 junk funds have lost a total of about $ 6 billion -- more than 15 % of assets -- through sales or transfers of junk-fund shares , Dalbar says .
wsj_0768	3	It made the estimates based on data collected from more than a dozen big junk funds .
wsj_0768	4	Interviews with three major fund groups -- Fidelity Investments , Vanguard Group Inc. and T. Rowe Price Associates Inc. -- confirm the trend .
wsj_0768	5	Their junk funds combined have had net outflows totaling nearly $ 500 million , or about 13 % of their junk fund assets , in the past two months .
wsj_0768	6	Some fund managers say negative publicity has exacerbated investors ' concern about recent declines in junk-bond prices .
wsj_0768	7	`` People have been seeing headline after headline after headline and saying : ` I ca n't take it anymore -- I 'm getting out , ' '' says Kurt Brouwer of Brouwer & Janachowski , a San Francisco investment adviser .
wsj_0768	8	The withdrawals could spell trouble for the $ 200 billion junk market .
wsj_0768	9	If the heavy outflows continue , fund managers will face increasing pressure to sell off some of their junk to pay departing investors in the weeks ahead .
wsj_0768	10	Such selling could erode prices of high-yield junk bonds , already weakened by a rash of corporate credit problems .
wsj_0768	11	Mutual fund groups have n't lost control of much of the outgoing money , says Louis Harvey , Dalbar 's president .
wsj_0768	12	Mutual fund officials say that investors have transferred most of it into their money market accounts , and to a lesser extent , government-bond funds .
wsj_0768	13	So the impact on the $ 950 billion mutual fund industry as a whole probably will be slight .
wsj_0768	14	But tremors are likely in the junk-bond market , which has helped to finance the takeover boom of recent years .
wsj_0768	15	Mutual funds are the among the largest holders of junk , accounting for more than a quarter of the entire high-yield , high-risk market .
wsj_0768	16	The 88 mutual funds investing solely in junk bonds hold assets of about $ 32 billion .
wsj_0768	17	Other funds hold a smattering of junk bonds , too .
wsj_0768	18	The $ 1.5 billion Fidelity High Income Fund has had a net outflow of about $ 150 million in the past two months .
wsj_0768	19	About $ 60 million streamed out last week alone , double the level of the week following last month 's Campeau Corp. credit squeeze .
wsj_0768	20	About 98 % of the outflow was transferred to other Fidelity funds , says Neal Litvack , a Fidelity vice president , marketing , with most going into money market funds .
wsj_0768	21	`` You get a news item , it hits , you have strong redemptions that day and for two days following -- then go back to normal , '' says Mr. Litvack .
wsj_0768	22	The fund , with a cash cushion of more than 10 % , has `` met all the redemptions without having to sell one thing , '' Mr. Litvack says .
wsj_0768	23	He adds : `` Our fund has had positive net sales every month for the last three years -- until this month . ''
wsj_0768	24	Vanguard 's $ 1 billion High Yield Bond Portfolio has seen $ 161 million flow out since early September ; $ 14 million of that seeped out Friday Oct. 13 alone .
wsj_0768	25	Still , two-thirds of the outflow has been steered into other Vanguard portfolios , says Brian Mattes , a vice president .
wsj_0768	26	The fund now holds a cash position of about 15 % .
wsj_0768	27	At the $ 932 million T. Rowe Price High Yield Fund , investors yanked out about $ 182 million in the past two months .
wsj_0768	28	Those withdrawals , most of which were transferred to other T. Rowe Price funds , followed little change in the fund 's sales picture this year through August .
wsj_0768	29	`` The last two months have been the whole ball game , '' says Steven Norwitz , a vice president .
wsj_0768	30	Junk-fund holders have barely broken even this year , as fat interest payments barely managed to offset declining prices .
wsj_0768	31	Through Oct. 19 , high-yield funds had an average 0.85 % total return the price change plus dividends on fund shares , according to Lipper Analytical Services Inc .
wsj_0768	32	That 's even less than the 4.35 % total return of the Merrill Lynch High-Yield Index .
wsj_0768	33	Fidelity 's junk fund has fallen 2.08 % this year through Oct. 19 , Lipper says ; the Vanguard fund rose 1.84 % ; and the T. Rowe Price fund edged up 0.66 % .
wsj_0768	34	People who remain in junk funds now could get hit again , some analysts and fund specialists say .
wsj_0768	35	Many funds in recent weeks and months have been selling their highest-quality junk issues , such as RJR Nabisco , to raise cash to meet expected redemptions .
wsj_0768	36	Funds might be forced to accept lower prices if they expand their selling to the securities of less-creditworthy borrowers .
wsj_0768	37	And then , asset values of the funds could plunge more than they have so far .
wsj_0768	38	Says Michael Hirsch , chief investment officer of Republic National Bank and manager of the FundTrust Group in New York : `` It 's a time bomb just waiting to go off .
wsj_0769	0	The surprise resignation yesterday of British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson sent sterling into a tailspin against the dollar by creating uncertainties about the direction of the British economy .
wsj_0769	1	The U.S. unit also firmed against other currencies on the back of sterling 's tumble , as market participants switched out of pounds .
wsj_0769	2	The pound also dropped precipitously against the mark , falling below the key 2.90-mark level to 2.8956 marks from 2.9622 marks late Wednesday .
wsj_0769	3	Mr. Lawson 's resignation shocked many analysts , despite the recent recurring speculation of a rift between the chancellor and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher .
wsj_0769	4	Indeed , only hours earlier , Mrs. Thatcher had called Mr. Lawson 's economic policies `` sound '' and said she has `` always supported '' him .
wsj_0769	5	`` There was a general feeling that we 'd seen the worst , '' said Patrick Foley , deputy chief economic adviser for Lloyds Bank in London .
wsj_0769	6	`` The resignation came as a great surprise . ''
wsj_0769	7	Graham Beale , manager of foreign-exchange operations at Hong Kong & Shanghai Banking Corp. in New York , added that Mrs. Thatcher 's comments reinforced the market 's growing confidence about sterling and compounded the unit 's later decline .
wsj_0769	8	`` The market was caught totally the wrong way ... .
wsj_0769	9	Everyone was extremely long on sterling , '' Mr. Beale said .
wsj_0769	10	In late New York trading yesterday , the dollar was quoted at 1.8400 marks , up from 1.8353 marks late Wednesday , and at 142.10 yen , up from 141.52 yen late Wednesday .
wsj_0769	11	Sterling was quoted at $ 1.5765 , sharply down from $ 1.6145 late Wednesday .
wsj_0769	12	In Tokyo Friday , the U.S. currency opened for trading at 142.02 yen , up from Thursday 's Tokyo close of 141.90 yen .
wsj_0769	13	Few analysts had much good to say about the pound 's near-term prospects , despite the fact that most do n't anticipate a shift in Mrs. Thatcher 's economic policies .
wsj_0769	14	Mr. Foley of Lloyds noted that Mr. Lawson 's replacement , John Major , the British foreign minister , will take time to establish his credibility and , in the meantime , sterling could trend downward in volatile trade .
wsj_0769	15	But Mr. Foley predicted few economic policy changes ahead , commenting that Mr. Major shares `` a very similar view of the world '' with Mr. Lawson .
wsj_0769	16	Bob Chandross , chief economist at Lloyds Bank in New York , also noted that the pound 's sharp decline is pegged more to uncertainty in the market than a vision of altered United Kingdom economic policies .
wsj_0769	17	Unless Mr. Lawson 's resignation leads to a change in British interest-rate policy -- Mrs. Thatcher 's administration firmly supports high interest rates to keep inflation in check -- or posturing toward full inclusion in the European Monetary System 's exchange-rate mechanism , Mr. Lawson 's withdrawal will have little long-term impact on exchange rates , Mr. Chandross concluded .
wsj_0769	18	Also announcing his resignation Thursday was Alan Walters , Mrs. Thatcher 's economic adviser and Mr. Lawson 's nemesis .
wsj_0769	19	The pound , which had been trading at about $ 1.6143 in New York prior to Mr. Lawson 's announcement , sank more than two cents to $ 1.5930 , prompting the Federal Reserve Bank to buy pounds for dollars .
wsj_0769	20	The Fed 's move , however , only proved a stopgap to the pound 's slide and the Fed intervened for a second time at around $ 1.5825 , according to New York traders .
wsj_0769	21	Meanwhile , dollar trading was relatively uninspired throughout the session , according to dealers , who noted that Thursday 's release of the preliminary report on the U.S. third-quarter gross national product was something of a nonevent .
wsj_0769	22	U.S. GNP rose at an annual rate of 2.5 % in the third quarter .
wsj_0769	23	The implicit price deflator , a measure of inflation , was down to a 2.9 % annual rate of increase in the quarter from a 4.6 % rate of gain in the second quarter .
wsj_0769	24	In Europe , the dollar ended lower in dull trading .
wsj_0769	25	The market closed prior to Mr. Lawson 's announcement .
wsj_0769	26	On the Commodity Exchange in New York , gold for current delivery rose $ 3.40 to $ 372.50 an ounce in heavy trading .
wsj_0769	27	The close was the highest since August 3 .
wsj_0769	28	Estimated volume was five million ounces .
wsj_0769	29	In early trading in Hong Kong Friday , gold was quoted at $ 370.85 an ounce .

wsj_0772	1	We lived in rural areas many years , but now live in St. Louis County , Mo .
wsj_0772	2	This morning as I drove the 13 miles to my law office and endured the routine heavy traffic during that twice-daily journey , I thought of how fortunate it was that we made the decision to be residents of an expanding community with so many opportunities and where so much is happening .
wsj_0772	3	The presence of so many people , cars and competing businesses is evidence of a healthy economy in a place where people want to live .
wsj_0772	4	I thought back to our time in small , sparsely populated communities .
wsj_0772	5	I remembered how hard it was for an outsider to become accepted by long-established , stake-holding residents , and what pitfalls awaited an original thinker in societies that were long accustomed to unchanging , `` safe '' ways of thought and action .
wsj_0772	6	I remembered being fired at age 44 , with five children at home , when my views and actions were deemed unsettling by a timid , small-town employer .
wsj_0772	7	How difficult it is for a thinking person to live among societies rooted in the past .
wsj_0772	8	Now , I revel in the freedom , culture , activity and diversity of this great metropolitan area with its traffic jams and perpetual road-building projects .
wsj_0772	9	Yet when my youngest child died two years ago , I buried him in the church cemetery of a small Missouri town .
wsj_0772	10	So after all , even the bitterest critic of rural exclusivity harbors a continuing yearning for those scarce , rural virtues thought to exist amid fields , forests and country lanes .

wsj_0773	0	Finnish government officials are negotiating with creditors of Waertsilae Marine Oy , a major shipyard that filed for bankruptcy protection this week , amid confusion and mounting doubts that collapse of the nation 's entire shipbuilding industry can be averted .
wsj_0773	1	At stake are almost 10,000 jobs in an industry that has been the mainstay of Finland 's post-war economic revival .
wsj_0773	2	Shipbuilding became a point of pride as Finnish shipyards remained profitable long after rivals collapsed all over Europe .
wsj_0773	3	But if , as many now fear , Waertsilae Marine joins the ranks of failed shipyards it might turn out to be remembered most as a blemish on Finland 's international reputation .
wsj_0773	4	The shipyard 's 6.5 billion Finnish markka $ 1.54 billion backlog includes about 20 ships ordered by big international shippers , including three for Carnival Cruise Lines Inc .
wsj_0773	5	Miami-based Carnival said the first of the three ships is scheduled to be delivered next month , just in time for the winter tourist season in the Caribbean .
wsj_0773	6	The second ship is scheduled to be delivered in fall 1990 and the third in fall 1991 .
wsj_0773	7	One analyst said the first ship probably will be delivered close to schedule , but that Carnival may have to pay up to 25 % more to get the second and third ships .
wsj_0773	8	All the ships are covered by loan guarantees from a state export financing agency , even though it 's not clear whether they will actually be built .
wsj_0773	9	Bankers worry that if the government makes good a threat to withdraw its guarantee commitments , shippers will counter with a hail of lawsuits .
wsj_0773	10	State loan guarantees are rarely a source of controversy .
wsj_0773	11	However , some bankers cited possible parallels between the Waertsilae Marine case and the collapse of Norway 's state-owned Kongsberg Vappenfabrikk AS two years ago .
wsj_0773	12	In that case , international banks and investors incurred big losses because they incorrectly believed the company 's debt carried implicit state guarantees .
wsj_0773	13	Doubts about the quality of state credit guarantees could reduce the competitive strength of Finnish companies in world markets where financing often is the key to winning orders , analysts warn .
wsj_0773	14	Moreover , state-owned Finnish companies lacking formal state guarantees could face greater difficulty raising funds in international financial markets , bankers say .
wsj_0773	15	The decision by a majority of state-appointed Waertsilae Marine directors Monday to file for bankruptcy was an abrupt about-face from previous government policy .
wsj_0773	16	In August , the government played a major part in a sweeping restructuring of the troubled shipyard .
wsj_0773	17	At the time 71%-controlled by Oy Waertsilae , a conglomerate , the shipbuilding unit faced potential losses estimated at one billion markka and was on the brink of liquidation .
wsj_0773	18	Under the rescue plan , Waertsilae sold 51 % of its stake to a group of banks and pension funds .
wsj_0773	19	The government , in turn , guaranteed financing to complete the order backlog and took control of the board .
wsj_0773	20	Government officials were expected to combine Waertsilae Marine with two other struggling firms , and thus ensure Finland 's survival as a shipbuilding nation .
wsj_0773	21	The government spent most of last year attempting to carry out such a plan but was thwarted when the parent Waertsilae concern pulled out at the last minute .
wsj_0773	22	After the restructuring of Waertsilae Marine and bolstered by state loan guarantees , two big bank creditors , Union Bank of Finland and state-controlled Postipankki , resumed lending the shipyard working capital .
wsj_0773	23	But the bankers got cold feet recently as government officials complained they had been misled about the shipyard 's actual financial condition , and hinted the credit guarantees might be withdrawn .
wsj_0773	24	People familiar with Monday 's board meeting said it was the state 's refusal to explicitly reaffirm the credit guarantees that led Union Bank and Postipankki to halt lending to Waertsilae Marine .
wsj_0773	25	Then , in a boardroom showdown , state-appointed directors voted to file for bankruptcy , apparently under instructions from Finland 's Industry Minister Ilkka Suominen .
wsj_0773	26	Analysts say Mr. Suominen had grown increasingly worried about the state 's potential financial exposure as Waertsilae Marine 's losses ballooned to more than double the figure estimated in August .
wsj_0773	27	Noting that Sweden wound up wasting state subsidies of about 35 billion Swedish kronor $ 5.47 billion during the 1970s in a vain attempt to salvage its shipbuilding industry , one analyst suggested that Mr. Suominen may have decided to cut Finland 's losses once and for all .
wsj_0773	28	Senior ministry officials huddled with creditors during the week in an attempt to agree on some form of restructuring that would keep Waertsilae Marine operating .
wsj_0773	29	The talks may drag on for weeks before any concrete result is announced , people familiar with them said .
wsj_0773	30	One solution would be to sell the shipyard to an outsider .
wsj_0773	31	But there appear to be few , if any , suitors .
wsj_0773	32	Indeed , the potential losses make any rescue scheme unlikely unless the politicians once again change tack and agree to pick up the bill , analysts said .
wsj_0773	33	Meantime , shippers with vessels on order from Waertsilae Marine will remain in limbo .
wsj_0774	0	Turner Broadcasting System Inc. said it expects to report an extraordinary loss of about $ 122 million in the fourth quarter due to early retirement of debt .
wsj_0774	1	The cable programmer said the loss will consist primarily of prepayment penalties , and unamortized issue discount and costs related to its just-completed $ 1.6 billion refinancing of its long-term debt and some preferred stock in one of its subsidiaries .
wsj_0774	2	A Turner spokesman would n't speculate on the extent of the charge 's effect on the quarter 's earnings , but said the company continues to expect to report a net loss for 1989 .
wsj_0774	3	The company said the repayment or redemption of the long-term debt , and the outstanding Class A cumulative exchangeable preferred stock of Cable News Network , was made possible by an offering of about $ 750 million of debentures and notes and $ 900 million in bank borrowings .
wsj_0774	4	The offering included $ 550 million of 12 % senior subordinated debentures due 2001 and $ 200 million of zero coupon liquid yield option notes due 2004 .
wsj_0774	5	The notes were priced to yield 8 % and are convertible into the company 's Class B common stock at a price which represents a 15 % premium over the market price on Oct. 10 , 1989 .
wsj_0774	6	In addition , the company called its 12 7/8 % senior subordinated notes due 1994 , with an aggregate principal amount of $ 200 million , for redemption on Dec. 15 .
wsj_0774	7	As a result of the refinancing , the company said the interest on the debt will fall to slightly more than 11 % from slightly more than 14 % .
wsj_0774	8	In American Stock Exchange composite trading , Turner 's Class A stock closed at $ 50.50 , down 37.5 cents .
wsj_0775	0	General Motors Corp. said it will temporarily idle its Arlington , Texas , assembly plant for one week beginning Monday because of slow sales .
wsj_0775	1	The closing will affect about 3,000 workers and eliminate production of 700 cars .
wsj_0775	2	The assembly plant builds the Cadillac DeVille , Chevrolet Caprice and Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera Wagon .
wsj_0775	3	In addition , GM 's Truck & Bus Group said slow sales are forcing it to close its Detroit assembly plant the week beginning Monday .
wsj_0775	4	The plant builds chassis for recreational vehicles and about 450 workers will be affected by the closing .
wsj_0775	5	The No. 1 auto maker scheduled overtime this week at its Janesville , Wis. , assembly plant , manufacturer of the Chevrolet Cavalier .
wsj_0775	6	The nine major U.S. auto makers plan to build 147,121 vehicles this week , down 9.6 % from the 162,767 a year ago , but 2.5 % higher than last week 's 143,534 .
wsj_0775	7	Ford Motor Co. slated overtime again this week at its Wixom , Mich. ; Wayne , Mich. ; Kansas City , Mo. , and Norfolk , Va. , assembly plants .
wsj_0775	8	They build the Lincoln Town Car , Continental and Mark VII , the Ford Escort and full-sized pickup trucks .
wsj_0775	9	Chrysler Corp. scheduled overtime this week at its St. Louis Assembly Plant No. 2 , Newark , Del. , and Sterling Heights , Mich. , assembly plants .
wsj_0775	10	They build extended minivans and the Dodge Spirit , Acclaim , Shadow and Sundance .

wsj_0777	0	SYDNEY-Qintex Australia Ltd. , under pressure from bank lenders , has called in accounting firm Peat Marwick Hungerfords to help oversee asset sales and restructure the resorts and media company .
wsj_0777	1	Analysts said the move could presage even harsher action by the banks .
wsj_0777	2	But any move by the banks to take over Qintex Australia 's management could threaten its ability to operate its national television network under Australian broadcast license rules .
wsj_0777	3	That , in turn , could substantially reduce the value of the television assets .
wsj_0777	4	The appointment of Peat Marwick , which has a unit that specializes in advising troubled companies , came about as a result of a round of meetings held by Qintex Australia Chairman Christopher Skase with bank creditors .
wsj_0777	5	Yesterday , Mr. Skase said the company is `` solvent and with the continued support of its bankers is able to meet its financial commitments . ''
wsj_0777	6	Qintex Australia is a unit of Qintex Ltd .
wsj_0777	7	The Qintex group 's problems began in earnest in March , when Mr. Skase agreed to buy MGM/UA Communications Co .
wsj_0777	8	But the transaction faltered in September , when Qintex Australia was forced to increase its offer to US$ 1.5 billion following a counterbid from Rupert Murdoch ; the deal fell apart altogether earlier this month .
wsj_0777	9	Qintex Australia owes creditors around A$ 1.2 billion .
wsj_0777	10	Last Friday , Qintex Entertainment Inc. , its 43%-owned U.S. TV production and distribution affiliate , filed for Chapter 11 protection .
wsj_0778	0	The government is sharpening its newest weapon against white-collar defendants : the power to prevent them from paying their legal bills .
wsj_0778	1	And defense lawyers are warning that they wo n't stick around if they do n't get paid .
wsj_0778	2	The issue has come to a boil in Newark , N.J. , where federal prosecutors have warned lawyers for Eddie Antar that if the founder and former chairman of Crazy Eddie Inc. is indicted , the government may move to seize the money that Mr. Antar is using to pay legal fees .
wsj_0778	3	The warning by the U.S. attorney 's office follows two decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court last June .
wsj_0778	4	In those cases , the high court ruled that federal law gives prosecutors broad authority to seize assets of people accused of racketeering and drug-related crimes , including fees paid to lawyers before an indictment .
wsj_0778	5	If the government succeeds in seizing Mr. Antar 's assets , he could be left without top-flight legal representation , because his attorneys are likely to quit , according to individuals familiar with the case .
wsj_0778	6	A seizure also would make the case the largest -- and one of the first -- in which lawyers ' fees have been confiscated in a prosecution unrelated to drugs .
wsj_0778	7	`` The people who suffer in the short run are defendants , but the people who suffer in the long run are all of the people , because there wo n't be a vigorous private bar to defend the Bill of Rights , '' says Gerald Lefcourt , a criminal defense attorney who says he has turned down a number of cases to avoid possible fee seizures .
wsj_0778	8	Mr. Antar is being investigated by a federal grand jury in Newark , where prosecutors have told him that they may soon seek an indictment on racketeering and securities fraud charges .
wsj_0778	9	Under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law , or RICO , the government has the authority to seek to freeze or seize a defendant 's assets before trial .
wsj_0778	10	According to individuals familiar with Mr. Antar 's case , prosecutors issued their warning this week after one of Mr. Antar 's attorneys asked whether legal fees might be subject to seizure .
wsj_0778	11	In a letter , prosecutors told Mr. Antar 's lawyers that because of the recent Supreme Court rulings , they could expect that any fees collected from Mr. Antar may be seized .
wsj_0778	12	Prosecutors have told Mr. Antar 's attorneys that they believe Mr. Antar 's allegedly ill-gotten gains are so great that any money he has used to pay attorneys derives from illegal activities .
wsj_0778	13	Therefore , they said , the money can be taken from the lawyers even after they are paid .
wsj_0778	14	Justin Feldman and Jack Arseneault , attorneys for Mr. Antar , both declined to comment on the matter .
wsj_0778	15	In Newark , U.S. Attorney Samuel A. Alito said , `` I do n't think there 's any legal reason to limit forfeiture of attorney 's fees to drug cases . ''
wsj_0778	16	Mr. Alito said his office `` just responded to an attorney 's question about whether we would go after attorney 's fees , and that is different from actually doing it , although we reserve that right . ''
wsj_0778	17	Mr. Antar was charged last month in a civil suit filed in federal court in Newark by the Securities and Exchange Commission .
wsj_0778	18	In that suit , the SEC accused Mr. Antar of engaging in a `` massive financial fraud '' to overstate the earnings of Crazy Eddie , Edison , N.J. , over a three-year period .
wsj_0778	19	Through his lawyers , Mr. Antar has denied allegations in the SEC suit and in civil suits previously filed by shareholders against Mr. Antar and others .
wsj_0778	20	The SEC has alleged that Mr. Antar aimed to pump up the company 's stock price through false financial statements in order to sell his stake and reap huge profits .
wsj_0778	21	Mr. Antar , the SEC said , made more than $ 60 million from the sale of his shares between 1985 and 1987 .
wsj_0778	22	The Justice Department has emphasized that the government 's fee-forfeiture power is to be used sparingly .
wsj_0778	23	According to department policy , prosecutors must make a strong showing that lawyers ' fees came from assets tainted by illegal profits before any attempts at seizure are made .
wsj_0778	24	Still , criminal defense lawyers worry that defendants are being deprived of their Sixth Amendment right to counsel and a fair trial if the government can seize lawyers ' fees .
wsj_0778	25	They also worry that if the government applies asset-forfeiture laws broadly , the best defense lawyers will be unwilling to take criminal cases unless they are assured of being paid .
wsj_0780	0	Bank of England Governor Robin Leigh-Pemberton urged banks to be cautious in financing leveraged buy-outs .
wsj_0780	1	`` Caution should ... be the rule of the day , '' said Mr. Leigh-Pemberton in a speech to the Association of Corporate Treasurers ' annual dinner .
wsj_0780	2	`` It would be damaging to industry and to the financial sector in general , to say nothing of banks , if prudence does not guide the financing of leveraged transactions . ''
wsj_0780	3	His remarks were distributed to the press before Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson announced his resignation last evening .
wsj_0780	4	Bank of England officials said the central bank had no comment on Mr. Lawson 's resignation .
wsj_0780	5	Mr. Leigh-Pemberton reiterated that the exposure of United Kingdom banks to leveraged deals have n't yet reached `` worrying levels . ''
wsj_0780	6	However , in light of the risks involved in such transactions , banks should satisfy themselves that they have the skills to participate in this market and clear policy guidelines on acceptable levels of exposure to such transactions , he said .
wsj_0780	7	In other comments , he said takeovers may not always be the most efficient way of securing a change of corporate direction or strategy .
wsj_0780	8	`` A similar result could sometimes be achieved , at less cost , by changing managements , '' he said .
wsj_0781	0	Intel Corp. 's most powerful computer chip has flaws that could delay several computer makers ' marketing efforts , but the `` bugs '' are n't expected to hurt Intel and most computer makers .
wsj_0781	1	Computer experts familiar with the flaws , found in Intel 's 80486 chip , say the defects do n't affect the average user and are likely to be cleared up before most computers using the chip as their `` brains '' appear on the market sometime next year .
wsj_0781	2	Intel said that last week a customer discovered two flaws in its 80486 microprocessor chip 's `` floating-point unit '' , a set of circuits that do certain calculations .
wsj_0781	3	On Friday , Intel began notifying customers about the bugs which cause the chip to give wrong answers for some mathematical calculations .
wsj_0781	4	But while International Business Machines Corp. and Compaq Computer Corp. say the bugs will delay products , most big computer makers said the flaws do n't affect them .
wsj_0781	5	`` Bugs like this are just a normal part of product development , '' said Richard Archuleta , director of Hewlett-Packard Co. 's advanced systems development .
wsj_0781	6	Hewlett announced last week that it planned to ship a computer based on the 486 chip early next year .
wsj_0781	7	`` These bugs do n't affect our schedule at all , '' he said .
wsj_0781	8	Likewise , AST Research Inc. and Sun Microsystems Inc. said the bugs wo n't delay their development of 486-based machines .
wsj_0781	9	`` We have n't modified our schedules in any way , '' said a Sun spokesman .
wsj_0781	10	To switch to another vendor 's chips , `` would definitely not be an option , '' he said .
wsj_0781	11	Nonetheless , concern about the chip may have been responsible for a decline of 87.5 cents in Intel 's stock to $ 32 a share yesterday in over-the-counter trading , on volume of 3,609,800 shares , and partly responsible for a drop in Compaq 's stock in New York Stock Exchange composite trading on Wednesday .
wsj_0781	12	Yesterday , Compaq plunged further , closing at $ 100 a share , off $ 8.625 a share , on volume of 2,633,700 shares .
wsj_0781	13	Most of Compaq 's decline is being attributed to a third-quarter earnings report that came in at the low end of analysts ' expectations .
wsj_0781	14	Intel said it had corrected the problems and would start producing bugless chips next week .
wsj_0781	15	`` We should not be seeing any more , '' said Bill Rash , Intel 's director for the 486 chip .
wsj_0781	16	What 's more , the bugs only emerge on esoteric applications such as computer-aided design and scientific calculations , he said , and then very seldom .
wsj_0781	17	`` These errata do not affect business programs , '' he said .
wsj_0781	18	The bugs will cause problems in `` specific and rare circumstances that will not occur in typical applications '' such as word-processing and spreadsheets , said Michael Slater , editor of the Microprocessor Report , an industry newsletter .
wsj_0781	19	Sun , Hewlett-Packard and others say Intel is n't wholly to blame for the snafu .
wsj_0781	20	The real culprits , they said , are computer makers such as IBM that have jumped the gun to unveil 486-based products .
wsj_0781	21	`` The reason this is getting so much visibility is that some started shipping and announced early availability , '' said Hewlett-Packard 's Mr. Archuleta .
wsj_0781	22	`` You can do that but you 're taking a risk .
wsj_0781	23	Those companies are paying the price for taking the risk . ''
wsj_0781	24	In late September , IBM began shipping a plug-in card that converts its PS/2 model 70-A21 from a 80386 machine to an 80486 machine .
wsj_0781	25	An IBM spokeswoman said the company told customers Monday about the bugs and temporarily stopped shipping the product .
wsj_0781	26	IBM has no plans to recall its add-on cards , the spokeswoman said , and could probably circumvent the bugs without long product delays .
wsj_0781	27	`` We do n't look at this as a major problem for us , '' she said .
wsj_0781	28	Compaq , which said it discovered the bugs , still plans to announce new 486 products on Nov. 6 .
wsj_0781	29	Because of the glitch , however , the company said it does n't know when its machine will be commercially available .
wsj_0781	30	That 's a break from Compaq tradition , because the company does n't announce products until they 're actually at the dealers .
wsj_0781	31	The problem is being ballyhooed , experts say , because the 486 is Intel 's future flagship .
wsj_0781	32	Intel 's microprocessors are the chips of choice in many of today 's personal computers and the 80486 microprocessor is the spearhead of the company 's bid to guard that spot in the next generation of machines .
wsj_0781	33	`` Although these sorts of bugs are not at all uncommon , the 486 is an extremely high-profile product , '' said Mr. Slater , the newsletter editor .
wsj_0781	34	Intel 's 80486 chip is the Corvette of Intel 's microprocessors , a super-fast , super-expensive chip that only the most power-hungry computer users are likely to buy for at least several years .
wsj_0781	35	Unveiled last April , the chip crams 1.2 million transistors on a sliver of silicon , more than four times as many as on Intel 's earlier model , 80386 .
wsj_0781	36	Intel clocks the chip 's speed at 15 million instructions per second , or MIPs .
wsj_0781	37	That 's four times as fast as the 386 .
wsj_0781	38	Machines using the 486 are expected to challenge higher-priced work stations and minicomputers in applications such as so-called servers , which connect groups of computers together , and in computer-aided design .
wsj_0781	39	But while the chip 's speed in processing power is dazzling , it 's real strength lies in its software inheritance .
wsj_0781	40	The 486 is the descendant of a long series of Intel chips that began dominating the market ever since IBM picked the 16-bit 8088 chip for its first personal computer .
wsj_0781	41	A 16-bit microprocessor processes 16 pieces of data at a time and is slower than newer , 32-bit chips . )
wsj_0781	42	Since then , Intel has cornered a large part of the market with successive generations of 16-bit and 32-bit chips , all of which can run software written for previous models .
wsj_0781	43	That 's what will keep computer makers coming in spite of the irritation of bugs .
wsj_0781	44	Big personal computer makers and many makers of engineering workstations are developing 486-based machines , which are expected to reach the market early next year .
wsj_0781	45	Of the big computer makers , only Apple Computer Co. bases its machines on Motorola chips instead .
wsj_0781	46	`` The 486 is going to have a big impact on the industry , '' said Hewlett-Packard 's Mr. Archuleta .
wsj_0781	47	`` It 's going to be the leading edge technology in personal computers for the next few years .
wsj_0781	48	This bug is not going to have any affect on that at all . ''

wsj_0782	0	Bethlehem Steel Corp. has agreed in principle to form a joint venture with the world 's second-largest steelmaker , Usinor-Sacilor of France , to modernize a portion of Bethlehem 's ailing BethForge division .
wsj_0782	1	The venture , which involves adding sophisticated equipment to make cast-iron mill rolls , is part of a two-pronged effort to shore up a division that has posted continuing operating losses for several years .
wsj_0782	2	The other element includes consolidating BethForge 's press-forge operations .
wsj_0782	3	The entire division employs about 850 workers .
wsj_0782	4	While the joint venture affects only a small part of Bethlehem 's operations , it is significant because it marks the first time the nation 's No. 2 steelmaker has joined forces with a foreign partner .
wsj_0782	5	Wall Street analysts have criticized Bethlehem for not following its major competitors in linking with a foreign company to share costs and provide technology to modernize old facilities or build new ones .
wsj_0782	6	`` We think it 's a step in the right direction for Bethlehem , '' said Felix Bello , WEFA Group 's international steel analyst .
wsj_0782	7	`` It 's important to share the risk and even more so when the market has already peaked . ''
wsj_0782	8	He said the move could be the beginning of a broader relationship between the two companies , one that could open up new markets for Bethlehem .
wsj_0782	9	Bethlehem had little choice but to go with a European steelmaker , because its competitors already have tapped the Japanese and South Korean industry leaders , analysts noted .
wsj_0782	10	Under terms of the agreement , Usinor 's Chavanne-Ketin unit and Bethlehem would establish a modernized facility to make cast-iron mill rolls at the company 's cast-iron shop here .
wsj_0782	11	Terms for the venture , which would be jointly owned by both companies , were n't disclosed .
wsj_0782	12	The Usinor unit has agreed to provide technology and expertise to install a so-called spin caster by early next fall .
wsj_0782	13	The caster improves the metallurgical quality of the iron mill rolls , which are basically huge rolling pins used to flatten or shape steel products .
wsj_0782	14	Bethlehem is also working with the United Steelworkers union to consolidate BethForge 's two machine shops and four heat-treatment facilities of the press-forge operations .
wsj_0782	15	Once the consolidation is complete , Bethlehem plans to concentrate its forgings business on nuclear fabrication , hardened steel and large-diameter steel rolls for rolling mills and selected custom-die applications .
wsj_0782	16	Bethlehem said earlier this year that it planned to restructure the BethForge division to improve its cost structure .
wsj_0782	17	In the second quarter , Bethlehem posted a $ 50 million charge related to its plans to realign the division .
wsj_0783	0	If you 're still wondering about the causes of the slump in the junk-bond market , consider the case of Columbia Savings & Loan .
wsj_0783	1	The California thrift has just announced a $ 226 million third-quarter loss .
wsj_0783	2	How did this happen ?
wsj_0783	3	Well , when Congress in its recent S&L bailout mandated that the thrifts sell off all their junk-bond holdings by 1994 , it not only artificially increased the supply of these bonds in the market but also eliminated one of the few profitable investments thrifts have made .
wsj_0783	4	But there is a grimly ironic twist to the Columbia loss .
wsj_0783	5	As followers of the debate over a capital-gains tax cut know , there is much talk in Congress and indeed all over Washington about the need to `` encourage '' long-term investment and discourage the financial sector 's presumed obsession with the short term .
wsj_0783	6	Now , we regard this as a largely phony issue , but the `` long term '' is nonetheless a big salon topic all around the Beltway .
wsj_0783	7	It turns out that Columbia had this huge loss in large part because the new congressionally mandated rules forced it to adjust the book value of its soon-to-be-sold junk bonds to the lower of either their cost or market value .
wsj_0783	8	They could no longer be classified as what Columbia regarded them , namely long-term investments .
wsj_0783	9	Congress 's ham-handed treatment of the existing structure of junk-bond holdings reminds us of a story in the Journal earlier this year about the Baby Bell companies ' desire to have the court-ordered bans lifted on offering information services .
wsj_0783	10	The issue of seeking relief from Congress was raised to Delbert Staley , the chairman of Nynex .
wsj_0783	11	Mr. Staley replied : `` Legislation tends to be compromised .
wsj_0783	12	I believe we have to take a shot at getting as much done as we can through the court , through Justice and through state and federal regulatory agencies .
wsj_0783	13	I see Congress as a last resort . ''
wsj_0783	14	Healthy thrifts such as Columbia or the junk-bond market itself should have been so lucky .
wsj_0783	15	The reality of life in modern America is that if you want to wreck something that works , let it fall into the hands of Congress .
wsj_0785	0	Canadian production of market pulp rose 1 % in September from a year earlier as the industry operated at 87 % of capacity .
wsj_0785	1	The Canadian Pulp and Paper Association , an industry group , said Canadian mills produced 532,000 metric tons of market pulp in September , compared with 527,000 metric tons a year earlier .
wsj_0785	2	Market pulp is wood pulp sold on the open market to producers of paper and other products .
wsj_0785	3	The statistics exclude pulp consumed at the producing mill or shipped to another mill that is affiliated with the producing mill .
wsj_0785	4	Canada is the world 's largest producer of market pulp .
wsj_0785	5	The September 87 % operating rate compared with a rate of 101 % in August but was unchanged from a year earlier .
wsj_0785	6	In the first nine months of this year output was 5,377,000 metric tons , down from 5,441,000 metric tons a year earlier .
wsj_0786	0	IMA Holdings Corp. completed its $ 3 billion acquisition of American Medical International Inc. , purchasing 63 million shares , or 86 % , of the Los Angeles-based health-care services concern for $ 26.50 a share .
wsj_0786	1	The price also includes assumption of about $ 1.4 billion in debt .
wsj_0786	2	IMA is a group that includes First Boston Corp. and the Pritzker family of Chicago through the leveraged buy-out fund Harry Gray Melvyn Klein & Partners .
wsj_0786	3	Harry J. Gray and Melvyn N. Klein , along with five other IMA designees , were named to join American Medical 's 10-member board .
wsj_0786	4	The completion of the merger agreement follows months of twists and turns .
wsj_0786	5	In January , American Medical brought in a new chief executive officer , Richard A. Gilleland , 45 , who will remain as chairman , president and chief executive .
wsj_0786	6	A few days later , American Medical announced sharply lower earnings , taking charges of $ 24 million for insurance reserves and canceled real estate leases .
wsj_0786	7	In March , American Medical received a $ 24-a-share offer to take the company private from an investor group including large holder M. Lee Pearce .
wsj_0786	8	It also was considering a restructuring to help boost the stock price .
wsj_0786	9	A group including several members of the the Bass family of Texas urged the company to take some steps to maximize shareholder value .
wsj_0786	10	The following month , the company put itself up for sale .
wsj_0786	11	It received more offers , but the auction was surprisingly won by IMA , which bid $ 28 a share and asked Mr. Gilleland to stay on as an equity participant .
wsj_0786	12	He indicated that some assets might be sold off to service the debt .
wsj_0786	13	Then , after extending its offer four times waiting for a congressional tax ruling , IMA early this month lowered its offer to $ 26.50 a share amid turbulence in the junk bond market .
wsj_0786	14	American Medical accepted the offer , meanwhile indicating it had heard from two other suitors .
wsj_0786	15	But they never materialized and IMA completed the purchase yesterday .
wsj_0786	16	Other new board members include John S. Harrison and Mark A. Adley of First Boston , James F. Lyons , William S. Goldberg and Harold S. Handelsman .
wsj_0787	0	Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said that Congress should grant the Securities and Exchange Commission the power to close the stock markets in periods of crisis .
wsj_0787	1	In testimony to the Senate securities subcommittee , Mr. Brady disputed the view of SEC Chairman Richard Breeden , who told a House panel Wednesday that he does n't want the ability to halt the markets .
wsj_0787	2	Mr. Breeden contended that discretionary power could have an impact on the markets if rumors were to circulate about when the exchanges might be closed .
wsj_0787	3	He added that the president already has the power to close the markets in an emergency .
wsj_0787	4	But Mr. Brady argued that the SEC is closer to the markets and in a better position to understand when the exchanges are under such stress that they should be closed .
wsj_0787	5	Separately , Mr. Brady said he asked the Working Group on Financial Markets to determine whether futures margins are too low .
wsj_0787	6	He noted that some minimum margin requirements have been reduced to levels below those before the 1987 crash .
wsj_0787	7	`` This raises questions whether futures and equity margin requirements are consistent at these levels and whether futures margins are adequate , '' Mr. Brady said .
wsj_0787	8	Margins are the amount of money an investor needs to put up to buy or sell a futures contract .
wsj_0787	9	Margins on the futures exchanges typically are raised and lowered according to market volatility .
wsj_0787	10	The Chicago Mercantile Exchange margins for the Standard & Poor 's 500 stock-index futures stood at $ 10,000 a contract for speculators and $ 5,000 for hedgers before Oct. 16 , 1987 ; that day the hedging margin was raised to $ 7,500 .
wsj_0787	11	Margins were raised or lowered about a dozen times since the crash Oct. 19 , 1987 .
wsj_0787	12	Currently , they stand at $ 12,000 for speculators , who are typically individuals and non-member traders , and $ 6,000 for hedgers , which are usually institutions and have offsetting positions in the underlying stocks .
wsj_0787	13	Mr. Brady also said he expects the leveraged buy-out phenomenon to `` end under its own weight . ''
wsj_0787	14	Asked whether there is anything Congress should do to curb the LBO boom , Mr. Brady responded , `` I think the LBO phenomenon , while it wo n't stop completely , will be a thing of the past . ''
wsj_0787	15	Before taking any action , he advised the panel to `` see what the market has produced as a cure . ''
wsj_0787	16	Mr. Brady also agreed with senators ' concerns about recent stock-market volatility , and said he realizes that the gyrations are scaring investors from investing in stocks .
wsj_0787	17	But he added that individuals still are participating in the equity market indirectly through mutual funds and pension funds .
wsj_0787	18	The former Wall Street executive refused to offer an opinion on the controversy surrounding program trading , which has recently become a larger part of the trading in the market and has been blamed for accelerating the drop two weeks ago .
wsj_0787	19	`` I do not have a view of whether we should do anything about program trading at this time , '' he said .
wsj_0787	20	But Mr. Brady endorsed the market-revision bill that both houses of Congress will try to push through this session .
wsj_0787	21	That bill , proposed by the SEC last year , would require brokerage firms to disclose the financial positions of their holding companies , mandate large traders ' reporting of program or block trades , and improve clearing and settlement of trades between the futures and stock markets .
wsj_0787	22	The bill also would give the SEC the power to close the markets , a discretion that former SEC Chairman David Ruder wanted but Mr. Breeden does n't .
wsj_0787	23	Mr. Brady and senators agreed to have their staffs meet within the next week to start fine-tuning the bill .
wsj_0788	0	The Senate Agriculture Committee is responding to trading abuses in the futures markets with a far-reaching bill that would become the Futures Trading Practices Act of 1989 .
wsj_0788	1	The proposed legislation has a laudable goal : to assure the integrity of the U.S. futures markets .
wsj_0788	2	However , as is common with sweeping legislation , the proposal contains many provisions that could destroy important parts of the system it sets out to preserve .
wsj_0788	3	The complex bill , introduced by Sens. Patrick Leahy D. , Vt. , Richard Lugar R. , Ind. , and Bob Kerrey D. , Neb. , covers a wide range of provisions that would affect the funding and authority of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and would profoundly change the way the industry is regulated .
wsj_0788	4	These include provisions relating to the technology and systems that must be employed by exchanges , oversight and disciplinary procedures for exchange trading practices , the relationship between commodity brokerage firms and floor traders , and exchange governance .
wsj_0788	5	The bill also elevates even minor rule infractions to felonies and provides for recovery of punitive damages in civil lawsuits and arbitration cases without any showing of willful misconduct .
wsj_0788	6	Many aspects of the bill are salutary , providing appropriate public safeguards that can and should be instituted throughout the industry .
wsj_0788	7	Indeed , some of the bill 's requirements , including broad representation on the exchanges ' boards of directors and strong measures to prevent conflicts of interest , already have been put in place by the Coffee , Sugar & Cocoa Exchange and other futures exchanges .
wsj_0788	8	Other aspects of the bill , however , are either structured in ways that create unnecessary burdens for the industry or actually are harmful to the exchanges , the industry and ultimately the general public .
wsj_0788	9	One of the most prominent features is the requirement that in three years all exchanges have in place a system that records all trades by a source independent of the executing broker .
wsj_0788	10	The New York futures exchanges have been working together to develop a trade recording system much like the one called for in the bill .
wsj_0788	11	We would be delighted to have such a system in place today .
wsj_0788	12	But is it realistic for Congress to mandate by a rigid deadline a system that has not yet been subjected to feasibility studies ?
wsj_0788	13	What if the system does n't work ?
wsj_0788	14	What if the only system that does work is so expensive that , at best , only the largest exchanges can afford it ?
wsj_0788	15	Cost is a key consideration because of the global sweep of the financial markets .
wsj_0788	16	The U.S. futures exchanges compete world-wide as never before .
wsj_0788	17	Today , trading in almost any commodity can be diverted from U.S. markets with just a few strokes of a keyboard .
wsj_0788	18	All foreign markets are aggressively courting U.S. business .
wsj_0788	19	In fact , several London markets already offer lower costs for trading in the same or very similar contracts .
wsj_0788	20	The U.S. exchanges need both market integrity and cost-efficiency ; long-term growth depends on it .
wsj_0788	21	The Senate bill contains many provisions that will increase the costs of trading .
wsj_0788	22	The most arbitrary of these is the imposition of `` service fees , '' which will directly widen the cost spread between U.S. and foreign markets .
wsj_0788	23	Other provisions have a more subtle , but nonetheless real and detrimental effect on the international position of U.S. exchanges .
wsj_0788	24	These include the extension of liability into areas beyond those established by judicial precedent and the expansion of liability to include punitive damages .
wsj_0788	25	In addition to increasing costs as a result of greater financial exposure for members , these measures could have other , far-reaching repercussions .
wsj_0788	26	One section of the bill would make all commodity brokerage firms and floor brokers liable for damages without willful misconduct .
wsj_0788	27	Nowhere in the federal securities law is simple negligence or inadvertent action a source of liability under similar circumstances .
wsj_0788	28	It is only logical to assume that the enactment of this provision will lead to increased litigation .
wsj_0788	29	In an already low-profitmargin business , commodity brokerage firms may well decide to eliminate the risk and expense of dealing with the retail public , depriving the private individual of access to the markets .
wsj_0788	30	Another measure makes commodity brokerage firms liable for violations committed by independent floor brokers who execute trades for them .
wsj_0788	31	This untried concept would expose these firms to potentially astronomical punitive damages .
wsj_0788	32	Faced with the virtually impossible task of supervising the execution of each trade , many commodity brokerage firms are likely to stop doing business with independents and instead hire their own salaried floor brokers .
wsj_0788	33	This would force out of business many of the individuals and small firms that function as floor brokers .
wsj_0788	34	A consequence of their departure could be a serious diminution of market liquidity .
wsj_0788	35	Finally , under the bill , a number of legitimate , longstanding business practices would be arbitrarily banned , unless the CFTC were to take specific and timely action to permit them to continue .
wsj_0788	36	In other words , regulation will occur through inaction and happenstance , rather than through a normal deliberative procedure .
wsj_0788	37	The affected practices include the placing of oral orders , which is the way most public customer orders are placed , and trading between affiliated brokers , even though in some cases trading with affiliates may be the only way to obtain the best execution for a client .
wsj_0788	38	Also precluded would be dual trading , whereby a broker trades for customers as well as his own account , a practice that provides needed liquidity to the markets .
wsj_0788	39	All U.S. futures exchanges agree that these and other trading practices require proper regulation and supervision .
wsj_0788	40	Nonetheless , each has too much potential value to the system to be banned by legislative fiat before the CFTC carefully considers all the consequences of a ban and what the regulatory alternatives are .
wsj_0788	41	The markets are complex , as is the environment in which they function .
wsj_0788	42	When problems surface , the temptation becomes strong to summarily overhaul a market system that has served for more than 100 years .
wsj_0788	43	That temptation must be put aside to permit careful consideration of all the implications , positive and negative , of the proposed resolutions to those problems , and to avoid creating a marketplace where no one trades .

wsj_0791	0	Norwood Partners Limited Partnership of Boston said it may make a tender offer for some or all of Phoenix Technologies Ltd. 's common shares .
wsj_0791	1	Norwood , Mass.-based Phoenix , a once-high-flying maker of software for personal computers , has had substantial losses in the past two quarters .
wsj_0791	2	Its stock , which was as high as $ 18.75 a share , has been trading under $ 4 a share recently .
wsj_0791	3	Yesterday it closed at $ 4.375 a share , up $ 1.125 , in national over-the-counter trading .
wsj_0791	4	In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing , Norwood said it 's part of a group that holds 525,546 Phoenix Technologies common shares , or a 5.3 % stake .
wsj_0791	5	Norwood has made `` no detailed plans , '' but it has engaged in talks with other shareholders , the filing said .
wsj_0791	6	Phoenix declined to comment .
wsj_0791	7	Norwood is controlled by Daniel L. Barnett and Paul A. Reese , both officers of Boston-based Oasis Capital Management Inc. , a small Boston money management firm .
wsj_0791	8	Also involved in the group is Robert F. Angelo , formerly Phoenix 's senior vice president , field operations , who left Phoenix at the beginning of October .

wsj_0792	2	The tentative agreement provides for wage increases of 85 cents an hour retroactive to Sept. 25 , 1989 , ) and for increases of 19 cents , 70 cents and 35 cents an hour effective Jan. 1 , 1991 , 1992 and 1993 , respectively .
wsj_0792	3	It also provides for benefit adjustments , including a partial restoration of vacations and holidays , as well as work-rule changes to increase productivity .
wsj_0793	0	Ground zero of the HUD scandal is the Secretary 's `` discretionary fund , '' a honey pot used to fund projects that were n't approved through normal HUD channels .
wsj_0793	1	Jack Kemp wants to abolish it .
wsj_0793	2	Instead , Congress 's idea of reform is to increase this slush fund by $ 28.4 million .
wsj_0793	3	And transfer control of much of it to Capitol Hill .
wsj_0793	4	The HUD scandals will simply continue , but under new mismanagement .
wsj_0793	5	After one of the most amazing debates we 've ever seen on the cable channel C-SPAN , the House voted 250 to 170 on Wednesday to order $ 28.4 million in spending for a New Jersey arts center , a Michigan library and 38 other pet projects out of the same discretionary fund that was supposed to have been so abused during Sam Pierce 's tenure .
wsj_0793	6	HUD has no paper work whatsoever on 30 of the projects , none of the others has been approved and not a single congressional hearing has been held on any of them .
wsj_0793	7	However , four are in the Michigan district of Rep. Bob Traxler , the chairman of the House subcommittee that writes the HUD spending bill .
wsj_0793	8	Of course , this kind of blatant congressional pork-barreling is called `` constituent service '' by Members , while the same kind of noncompetitive favoritism at HUD is labeled `` influence peddling . ''
wsj_0793	9	Unlike those awful Republican consultants , Members do n't profit directly from HUD projects .
wsj_0793	10	They merely collect campaign contributions from developers that help keep them in office .
wsj_0793	11	The 40 pet projects were discovered buried in the appropriations bill for HUD and some other agencies after it returned from a conference committee that was called to resolve differences between the House and Senate versions .
wsj_0793	12	Conference committees are breeding grounds for mischief .
wsj_0793	13	They are often closed to the public and no minutes are taken .
wsj_0793	14	Members find it easy to doctor legislation by slipping in special provisions that could never survive in the cold light of day .
wsj_0793	15	In this case , the Members outdid themselves .
wsj_0793	16	They transferred some $ 28 million from the Community Development Block Grant program designated largely for low - and moderate-income projects and funneled it into such items as : -- $ 1.2 million for a performing-arts center in Newark , -- $ 1.3 million for `` job retention '' in Hawaiian sugar mills . -- $ 400,000 for a collapsing utility tunnel in Salisbury , -- $ 500,000 for `` equipment and landscaping to deter crime and aid police surveillance '' at a Michigan park . -- $ 450,000 for `` integrated urban data based in seven cities . '' No other details . -- $ 390,000 for a library and recreation center at Mackinac Island , Mich .

wsj_0794	0	This is slightly adapted from remarks Oct. 7 by former Secretary of State George P. Shultz to an alumni gathering at the Stanford Business School , where he has returned to the faculty :
wsj_0794	1	I was struck a couple of years ago by the drug-interdiction effort in the Bahamas .
wsj_0794	2	We had intercepted during the year an estimated $ 5 billion street value of cocaine .
wsj_0794	3	I do n't know how much got through .
wsj_0794	4	Nobody has any credible estimate .
wsj_0794	5	The GNP of the Bahamas is probably somewhere between one and two billion dollars .
wsj_0794	6	So you get an idea of the leverage there and elsewhere that our market for drugs has brought about .
wsj_0794	7	I welcome the emphasis that is now being put on the drug problem .
wsj_0794	8	The efforts to get to the people who are addicted , try to rehabilitate them ; if they can not be rehabilitated , at least to contain them ; to educate people , to strongly discourage use of drugs by people who are casual users and first users , to stop this process among the young -- all of these things I think are extremely important .
wsj_0794	9	But , I have to tell you that it seems to me that the conceptual base of the current program is flawed and the program is not likely to work .
wsj_0794	10	The conceptual base -- a criminal-justice approach -- is the same that I have worked through before , in the Nixon administration when I was budget director and secretary of the treasury with jurisdiction over the Customs .
wsj_0794	11	We designed a comprehensive program , and we worked hard on it .
wsj_0794	12	In the Reagan administration we designed a comprehensive program ; we worked very hard on it .
wsj_0794	13	Our international efforts were far greater than ever before .
wsj_0794	14	You 're looking at a guy whose motorcade was attacked in Bolivia by the drug terrorists , so I 'm personally a veteran of this war .
wsj_0794	15	What we have before us now is essentially the same program but with more resources plowed into all of the efforts to enforce and control .
wsj_0794	16	These efforts wind up creating a market where the price vastly exceeds the cost .
wsj_0794	17	With these incentives , demand creates its own supply and a criminal network along with it .
wsj_0794	18	It seems to me we 're not really going to get anywhere until we can take the criminality out of the drug business and the incentives for criminality out of it .
wsj_0794	19	Frankly , the only way I can think of to accomplish this is to make it possible for addicts to buy drugs at some regulated place at a price that approximates their cost .
wsj_0794	20	When you do that you wipe out the criminal incentives , including , I might say , the incentive that the drug pushers have to go around and get kids addicted , so that they create a market for themselves .
wsj_0794	21	They wo n't have that incentive because they wo n't have that market .
wsj_0794	22	So I think the conceptual base needs to be thought out in a different way .
wsj_0794	23	If I am catching your attention , then read a bold and informative article in this September 's issue of Science by Ethan Nadelmann on this subject .
wsj_0794	24	We need at least to consider and examine forms of controlled legalization of drugs .
wsj_0794	25	I find it very difficult to say that .
wsj_0794	26	Sometimes at a reception or cocktail party I advance these views and people head for somebody else .
wsj_0794	27	They do n't even want to talk to you .
wsj_0794	28	I know that I 'm shouting into the breeze here as far as what we 're doing now .
wsj_0794	29	But I feel that if somebody does n't get up and start talking about this now , the next time around , when we have the next iteration of these programs , it will still be true that everyone is scared to talk about it .
wsj_0794	30	No politician wants to say what I just said , not for a minute .

wsj_0803	0	Private-sector union contracts signed in the third quarter granted slightly lower wage increases than those signed in the second quarter , but wage increases still are running above last year 's levels .
wsj_0803	1	The Labor Department said wage settlements in the third quarter called for average annual wage increases of 3.6 % in the first year and 3.0 % over the life of the contracts .
wsj_0803	2	The last time parties to these settlements negotiated wage increases , mostly in 1986 or 1987 , wages increased an average of 2.4 % a year over the life of the contracts .
wsj_0803	3	If this pattern continues , the Labor Department said , 1989 will be the first year that the measure has shown an increase since 1981 when the department started comparing expiring contracts with those that replaced them .
wsj_0803	4	This reflects the restoration of wage cuts in the steel and other industries as well as higher wages granted nurses who work in health-care facilities .
wsj_0803	5	Settlements reached in the first nine months of 1989 called for wage increases averaging 3.7 % in the first contract year and 3.1 % annually over the life of the contracts , the department said .
wsj_0803	6	For all of 1988 , union contracts provided for 2.5 % wage increases in the first year and 2.4 % over the life of the contracts .
wsj_0803	7	In the second quarter , contracts called for increases of 3.9 % in the first year and 3.4 % over the life of the contracts .
wsj_0803	8	The figures exclude lump-sum payments and cost-of-living adjustments , so the actual wage increases may have been bigger .
wsj_0803	9	About 35 % of the workers covered by contracts signed in the first nine months of year get lump-sum payments ; about 15 % are covered by cost-of-living clauses .
wsj_0803	10	Unions covered by one or other provisions generally settled for lower percentage wage increases .
wsj_0803	11	The Labor Department said wage increases in manufacturing industries continue to be smaller than those in other industries .
wsj_0803	12	For all six million workers under major collective bargaining agreements , regardless of when they were signed , wage increases in the first nine months of 1989 averaged 2.5 % -- including cost-of-living adjustments .
wsj_0805	0	CMS ENERGY Corp. said management would recommend to its board today that its common stock dividend be reinstated at a `` modest level '' later this year .
wsj_0805	1	The Dearborn , Mich. , energy company stopped paying a dividend in the third quarter of 1984 because of troubles at its Midland nuclear plant .
wsj_0805	2	In addition , CMS reported third-quarter net of $ 68.2 million , or 83 cents a share , up from $ 66.8 million , or 81 cents a share , a year ago .
wsj_0806	0	HEALTHDYNE Inc. , Atlanta , said its subsidiary , Home Nutritional Services Inc. , registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission an initial public offering of four million shares of common .
wsj_0806	1	The in-home health care services provider said it will sell 1.8 million of the new shares , while Home Nutritional Services will sell the remaining 2.2 million .
wsj_0806	2	The company estimates the offering price at between $ 14 and $ 16 a share .
wsj_0806	3	The company said it expects to use the proceeds to repay certain bank debt and for general corporate purposes , including establishing new operating centers and possible acquisitions .
wsj_0806	4	Home Nutritional currently has 10 million shares outstanding .
wsj_0806	5	It will have 11.8 million shares outstanding after the offering , with Healthdyne owning about 65 % of the total .
wsj_0807	0	Black & Decker Corp. said it agreed to sell its Bostik chemical adhesives unit to Orkem S.A. , a French chemical company , for $ 345 million .
wsj_0807	1	Bostik is the first Emhart Corp. unit to be sold as part of the power-tool manufacturer 's effort to reduce debt and consolidate operations after it acquired Emhart earlier this year .
wsj_0807	2	Black & Decker said it plans to put other Emhart units on the block in the future , with the goal of raising $ 1 billion in net proceeds .
wsj_0807	3	Black & Decker rescued Emhart from the takeover bid of Topper Limited Partnership last March by agreeing to acquire the maker of door locks and gardening tools for about $ 2.8 billion .
wsj_0807	4	The move significantly expanded Black & Decker 's product line , but also significantly increased its debt load .
wsj_0807	5	The acquisition boosted Black & Decker 's ratio of debt to total capital to more than 80 % .
wsj_0807	6	Company officials have said they plan to reduce that ratio to less than 50 % over the next 2 1/2 years .
wsj_0807	7	Earlier this year , Black & Decker put three Emhart businesses on the auction block : the information and electronics segment , the Dynapert electrical assembly business and Mallory Capacitors .
wsj_0807	8	The three units had combined 1988 sales of about $ 904 million .
wsj_0807	9	The three units contributed about a third of Emhart 's total sales .
wsj_0807	10	In addition , Black & Decker had said it would sell two other undisclosed Emhart operations if it received the right price .
wsj_0807	11	Bostic is one of the previously unnamed units , and the first of the five to be sold .
wsj_0807	12	The company is still negotiating the sales of the other four units and expects to announce agreements by the end of the year .
wsj_0807	13	The five units generated sales of about $ 1.3 billion in 1988 , almost half of Emhart 's $ 2.3 billion revenue .
wsj_0807	14	Bostic posted 1988 sales of $ 255 million .
wsj_0807	15	`` Our divestiture program is on schedule , and we remain confident that we will achieve our stated goal of over $ 1 billion in net proceeds , '' said Nolan D. Archibald , Black & Decker 's president and chief executive officer , in a statement .
wsj_0807	16	The sales are an attempt to quell investor concern about Black & Decker 's increased debt burden from the Emhart purchase .
wsj_0807	17	The company 's stock plunged when it first announced that it planned to acquire Emhart .
wsj_0807	18	The company maintains that it does n't expect Emhart to contribute to earnings for about another 12 months .
wsj_0807	19	In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange , Black & Decker closed at $ 19.75 yesterday , down 25 cents .
wsj_0807	20	The company did n't announce the sale until after the close of the market .

wsj_0808	1	Embedded in the `` budget '' being concocted by the House-Senate conference committee is something that looks , smells and waddles like a duck .
wsj_0808	2	It 's a nuisance tax on mergers .
wsj_0808	3	Congress has decided to raise $ 40 million by charging companies $ 20,000 for the honor of filing the required papers under the Hart-Scott-Rodino law .
wsj_0808	4	Ever since the bad days of Big is Bad antitrust enforcement , this law has required that anyone proposing a merger must make a filing describing the effects on all relevant markets .
wsj_0808	5	The Hart-Scott filing is then reviewed and any antitrust concerns usually met .
wsj_0808	6	Typically , Hart-Scott is used now to give managers of target firms early news of a bid and a chance to use regulatory review as a delaying tactic .
wsj_0808	7	The $ 20,000 tax would be a small cost in a multibillion-dollar deal , but a serious drag on thousands of small , friendly deals .
wsj_0808	8	One especially dangerous aspect to the new tax would be that the proceeds will be used to increase the budgets of the antitrust division at Justice and the Federal Trade Commission .
wsj_0808	9	This amounts to a bounty for regulators -- the more regulating the more they get to keep .
wsj_0808	10	Also , as former Reagan antitrust chief Charles Rule has noted , this would `` establish the precedent that the government may charge parties for the privilege of being sued regardless of whether the government prevails . ''
wsj_0808	11	Yet another opportunity for President Bush to respond , `` Read my lips .

wsj_0809	1	Mr. Grobstein had been a vice chairman of Ernst & Whinney , an accounting firm that merged with rival Arthur Young in July to form Ernst & Young , a major accounting , tax and management consulting firm .
wsj_0809	2	Mr. Grobstein 's appointment formalizes a role he has been performing since the merger , a spokeswoman said .
wsj_0810	0	Cie. de Navigation Mixte Chairman Marc Fournier said his board unanimously rejected as too low the $ 1.77 billion bid by Cie. Financiere de Paribas to bring its stake in Navigation Mixte to 66.7 % .
wsj_0810	1	At a news conference , Mr. Fournier accused Paribas of planning to pay for the takeover by selling parts of the company , whose interests include insurance , banking , tuna canning , sugar and orange juice .
wsj_0810	2	The chairman said his board members , including representatives of West German insurance giant Allianz AG and French banks Credit Lyonnais and Societe Generale , hold nearly 50 % of Navigation Mixte 's capital .
wsj_0810	3	Mr. Fournier said that as Navigation Mixte chairman , he is prohibited by takeover regulations from organizing his own defense or doing anything besides managing current company business .
wsj_0810	4	But sources said he will be urging his allies to boost their stakes in Navigation Mixte , which is being traded in London and is to resume trading in Paris Tuesday .
wsj_0810	5	At the same time , he is expected to seek legal and regulatory means of blocking or delaying Paribas 's bid .
wsj_0810	6	For the moment , the sources said , he has decided against seeking a white knight or organizing a counterbid for Paribas .
wsj_0810	7	Mr. Fournier said Navigation Mixte 's 1989 unconsolidated , or parent-company , profit is likely to be 4.7 billion francs $ 754.4 million , up from 633.8 million francs last year .
wsj_0810	8	That is due mostly to payments from Allianz for most of the 50 % stake it has agreed to acquire in Navigation Mixte 's insurance business .
wsj_0810	9	Mr. Fournier said the exceptional gain would mean nearly twice as high a dividend this year as last .
wsj_0810	10	If holders avoid tendering to Paribas , he added , they can expect strong dividends again next year .
wsj_0810	11	Analysts noted that over the past 20 years , Mr. Fournier has built his company through astute stock-market activity and has warded off at least three takeover attempts .
wsj_0810	12	This time , however , some analysts think he could face a real battle .
wsj_0810	13	`` Without some unexpected `` coup de theatre '' , I do n't see what will block the Paribas bid , '' said Philippe de Cholet , analyst at the brokerage Cholet-Dupont & Cie .
wsj_0810	14	Mr. de Cholet said Mr. Fournier 's biggest hope was to somehow persuade regulatory authorities to block the bid .
wsj_0810	15	Paribas still needs the go-ahead from the Commission des Operations de Bourse , a government regulatory agency , but analysts said that is considered likely .
wsj_0810	16	Mr. Fournier also noted that Navigation Mixte joined Paribas 's core of shareholders when Paribas was denationalized in 1987 , and said it now holds just under 5 % of Paribas 's shares .
wsj_0810	17	Once he realized that Paribas 's intentions were n't friendly , he said , but before the bid was launched , he sought approval to boost his Paribas stake above 10 % .
wsj_0810	18	The petition is still pending , but Mr. Fournier downplayed the likelihood of his organizing a takeover bid of his own for the much-larger Paribas .
wsj_0810	19	One big question now is the likely role of Mr. Fournier 's allies .
wsj_0810	20	Mr. Fournier said the large institutions that hold nearly 50 % of Navigation Mixte 's capital all strongly support him , but some analysts said they are n't so sure .
wsj_0810	21	Allianz , for example , has said in official comments so far that it will remain neutral .
wsj_0810	22	Paribas is Allianz 's lead French bank .
wsj_0810	23	Paribas said Monday that it intends to bid to boost its stake in Navigation Mixte to 66.7 % , from the 18.7 % it already owns .
wsj_0810	24	The purchase of the additional 48 % stake is expected to cost more than 11 billion francs $ 1.77 billion .
wsj_0810	25	Paribas says it will offer 1,850 francs $ 296.95 each for Navigation Mixte shares that enjoy full dividend rights , and 1,800 francs each for a block of shares issued July 1 , which will receive only partial dividends this year .
wsj_0810	26	Alternatively , it is to offer three Paribas shares for one Navigation Mixte share .
wsj_0810	27	The Paribas offer values Navigation Mixte at about 23 billion francs , depending on how many of Navigation Mixte 's warrants are converted into shares during the takeover battle .
wsj_0811	0	BLOCKBUSTER ENTERTAINMENT CORP. said it raised $ 92 million from an offering of liquid yield option notes .
wsj_0811	1	The gross proceeds from the sale of the notes , which will be due on Nov. 1 , 2004 , will be used to reduce existing debt and for general corporate purposes , the company said .
wsj_0811	2	The debt reduction is expected to save the Fort Lauderdale , Fla. home video concern about $ 2 million a year in interest expense .
wsj_0811	3	The zero-coupon subordinated notes have no periodic interest payments .
wsj_0811	4	Each note is being offered at $ 308.32 per $ 1,000 principal amount at maturity , representing an 8 % yield to maturity .
wsj_0811	5	In addition , each note can be converted into Blockbuster Entertainment common stock at a rate of 13.851 shares per note .
wsj_0811	6	Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc. is the sole underwriter for the offering .
wsj_0811	7	The notes will have a principal amount of $ 300 million at maturity .
wsj_0811	8	Blockbuster shares closed yesterday at $ 18.75 , down $ 1.125 , in New York Stock Exchange trading .

wsj_0815	2	DIG is the vehicle being used to pursue to acquisition .

wsj_0817	0	The House joined the Senate in making federal reparations for Japanese-Americans held in World War II internment camps a legal entitlement requiring the Treasury Department to meet expedited payments of an estimated $ 1.25 billion during the next several years .
wsj_0817	1	The 249-166 roll call came as the chamber approved a compromise bill allocating $ 17.2 billion to the departments of State , Justice , and Commerce in fiscal 1990 and imposing increased fees on business interests making filings with the government .
wsj_0817	2	An estimated $ 40 million would come annually from a new $ 20,000 charge on pre-merger notifications to the Justice Department , and Securities and Exchange Commission filing fees would rise by 25 % to fund a $ 26 million increase in the agency 's budget .
wsj_0817	3	Yesterday 's vote on Japanese-American reparations ensures final enactment of the entitlement provision , which abandons earlier efforts to find offsetting cuts but is seen as a more realistic path to expediting compensation first authorized in 1988 .
wsj_0817	4	`` The only way to reduce the costs is to say we do n't want to pay the bill , '' said Rep. Neal Smith D. , Iowa , who taunted President Bush 's party to back up his campaign promise of supporting the claims of $ 20,000 per individual .
wsj_0817	5	`` Read my lips , '' said Mr. Smith .
wsj_0817	6	`` If you 're for paying the claims ... I do n't know how anyone can oppose this . ''
wsj_0817	7	No payments would be made this year , but beginning in fiscal 1991 , the bill commits the government to annual payments of as much as $ 500 million until the total liability of $ 1.25 billion is met .
wsj_0817	8	The issue has assumed some of the character of past civil-rights debates and reopens old regional divisions in the Democratic majority .
wsj_0817	9	As much as Republicans led the opposition , among the 53 Democrats voting against treating the payments as an entitlement , 42 came from the 13 states in the Old Dixiecrat South and its borders .
wsj_0817	10	The odd mix of departments in the underlying bill makes it one of the more eclectic of the annual appropriations measures , and it is a lightning rod for a running battle over the fate of the Legal Services Corp .
wsj_0817	11	The measure provides $ 321 million to maintain services but would sharply curb the power of the current board until successors are agreed to by the Bush administration .
wsj_0817	12	The conservative bent of the incumbent appointees , named by former President Reagan , has divided Republicans .
wsj_0817	13	And on back-to-back roll calls , 206-199 and 223-178 , the Appropriations Committee leadership turned back efforts to weaken or strip the proposed restrictions first added by Sen. Warren Rudman R. , N.H.
wsj_0817	14	The estimated $ 40 million from the new pre-merger notification fee would be divided between the Justice Department 's Antitrust Division and the Federal Trade Commission , which both face serious cuts if the income is n't realized .
wsj_0817	15	The Federal Bureau of Investigation is slated to receive $ 30 million by charging for fingerprint services in civil cases , and the judiciary will rely on another $ 32 million from bankruptcy charges , including a 33 % increase in the current filing fee .
wsj_0817	16	The $ 17.2 billion total for the bill does n't include an estimated $ 1.2 billion in supplemental anti-drug funds approved by the House-Senate conference yesterday , and the rush of money is already provoking jealousy among states competing for assistance .
wsj_0817	17	The House agreed to defer for a year a scheduled 50 % increase in the required state matching funds for law-enforcement grants but , by a 287-123 margin , the chamber stripped a Senate initiative to raise the minimum grant for smaller states , such as New Hampshire and Delaware , to $ 1.6 million from $ 500,000 .
wsj_0817	18	Few are more powerful in the competition for funds than the appropriations committees themselves -- including the three authors of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit-reduction law .
wsj_0817	19	When a House-Senate conference on yesterday 's bill rescinded $ 11.8 million in unexpended funds for a Fort Worth , Texas , economic development project backed by former Speaker James Wright , Sen. Phil Gramm R. , Texas insisted last week that the money be preserved .
wsj_0817	20	The measure includes $ 2 million secured by Mr. Rudman for a marine-research project at the University of New Hampshire , and Sen. Ernest Hollings D. , S.C . used his power to add $ 10 million for an advanced technology initiative in the Commerce Department .
wsj_0817	21	This was in addition to a more parochial $ 4.5 million authorization for a health center in South Carolina upheld by a 273-121 vote in the House last night .
wsj_0819	0	There are two versions of `` Measure for Measure '' on stage at the Alley Theater here .
wsj_0819	1	One is a strong , vigorous portrayal of Shakespeare 's play ; the other is director Gregory Boyd 's overlay of present-day punk rock decadence on old Vienna .
wsj_0819	2	`` Measure for Measure '' is one of Shakespeare 's `` problem '' plays , so named because it does not fit neatly into a category such as tragedy , comedy or history .
wsj_0819	3	Its ambiguity and uneasy mixture of the serious and the comic is no doubt one reason why it is very much in vogue with directors just now .
wsj_0819	4	Last season , Hartford Stage director Mark Lamos mounted a production at Lincoln Center , and currently two other productions -- one just closed at the Old Globe in San Diego and another now at the Seattle Rep -- overlap with Mr. Boyd 's .
wsj_0819	5	In the play , the Duke of Vienna despairs over the licentiousness of his subjects and turns over the rule of the city to the puritanical Angelo , hoping he can set things right .
wsj_0819	6	When Angelo hears that the young man Claudio has made his fiancee pregnant before he could marry her , Angelo summarily condemns Claudio to death .
wsj_0819	7	When , however , Claudio 's sister , Isabella , a novitiate in a convent , goes to Angelo to plead her brother 's case , the obdurate ruler immediately falls in love with her and , in a supreme act of hypocrisy , demands that Isabella yield up her virtue to him in exchange for her brother 's life .
wsj_0819	8	Meanwhile , the Duke , who set the original scheme in motion , appears on the scene disguised as a friar and becomes involved in a series of intrigues that has everyone fearing the worst possible outcome until the Duke arranges a last minute reprieve for all concerned .
wsj_0819	9	For the Alley production , scene designer Peter David Gould has arranged a stark but extremely effective set featuring a rectangular platform of white-washed boards that extends into the audience .
wsj_0819	10	When the action requires , a prison cell , consisting of an enlarged wire cage , rolls forward on iron wheels on the platform .
wsj_0819	11	In the play 's major scenes Mr. Boyd demonstrates that he has a firm grasp of the Shakespearean dynamic .
wsj_0819	12	When Isabella Ellen Lauren confronts her brother Claudio Matt Loney in his cell , explaining the price she has been asked to secure his freedom ; when Isabella and the disguised Duke Philip Kerr conspire to trick Angelo ; and when Mariana Annalee Jefferies , a woman wronged by Angelo , confronts him with his past misdeeds , the performers bring the dramatic high points to life with intense energy and intelligence .
wsj_0819	13	At such moments Mr. Boyd makes it clear that he has the capacity to be a superior interpreter of Shakespeare .
wsj_0819	14	When , however , he decides to be modern , or more accurately , when he decides to be trendy , the results are far less satisfactory .
wsj_0819	15	Mr. Boyd is of the directorial school that believes one must find modern parallels or metaphors to make Shakespeare accessible to today 's audiences .
wsj_0819	16	It 's a valid approach , but it puts a heavy burden on the director to show an uncommon degree of imagination and taste .
wsj_0819	17	In his `` Measure , '' Mr. Boyd has `` modernized '' the pimps and prostitutes of Vienna whom Angelo is supposed to bring under control by converting them into transvestites , punk rockers and heavy metal types , with a strong emphasis on leather , chains and porno-inspired costumes .
wsj_0819	18	Loud rock music accompanies all the scene changes , even those in the convent .
wsj_0819	19	When Claudio is arrested , he is brought on stage nude except for the manacles on his wrists and ankles .
wsj_0819	20	When the opportunist Lucio Jack Stehlin visits the convent to inform Isabella of her brother 's fate , Lucio not only slaps the mother superior on her rear , but brings along a voluptuous companion Jill Powell , not in Shakespeare 's script , to undulate lasciviously .
wsj_0819	21	Meanwhile , the pimp Pompey Glen Allen Pruett , dressed in black leather and a prominent codpiece , indulges in enough obscene gestures and pelvic thrusts to launch a space probe .
wsj_0819	22	The problem here is not in the concept but in its lack of discrimination .
wsj_0819	23	The inclusion at one point , for example , of a list of glitzy modern-day malefactors , ranging from Jim Bakker and Leona Helmsley to Zsa Zsa Gabor , is a bid for a cheap laugh unworthy of Mr. Boyd 's ability .
wsj_0819	24	Despite the excesses , however , the scorecard for the production has many more pluses than minuses .
wsj_0819	25	What 's more , it represents an important step for the Alley Theater .
wsj_0819	26	`` Measure for Measure '' is Mr. Boyd 's first directorial assignment as the theater 's new artistic director .
wsj_0819	27	He succeeded Pat Brown , who was fired by the Alley board 18 months ago .
wsj_0819	28	Her dismissal angered many in the regional theater establishment and led Peter Zeisler , head of Theatre Communications Group , to write an editorial in American Theatre magazine condemning the board .
wsj_0819	29	None of this backlash could change the fact that Ms. Brown 's regime was remarkably undistinguished and unimaginative .
wsj_0819	30	Now the Alley has moved ahead on both artistic and financial fronts .
wsj_0819	31	Not only is Mr. Boyd giving the theater a new sense of adventure and excitement on stage , the balance sheet is the best the theater has had in 10 years .
wsj_0819	32	As opposed to the $ 1.4 million deficit of the 1987-88 season , the 1988-89 year concluded with a $ 200,000 surplus and a $ 500,000 cash reserve .
wsj_0819	33	Admittedly last season 's runaway hit , `` Steel Magnolias , '' helped a lot , but so did cost cutting and other measures insisted on by the board .
wsj_0819	34	Only time will tell if Mr. Boyd can restore to the Alley the acclaim it received when its founder , Nina Vance , was at the height of her powers .
wsj_0819	35	But it is clear he is going to give it a shot .
wsj_0820	0	Democratic leaders have bottled up President Bush 's capital-gains tax cut in the Senate and may be able to prevent a vote on the issue indefinitely .
wsj_0820	1	Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell D. , Maine said he intends to use Senate procedures to force advocates of the tax cut to come up with at least 60 votes before they can address the issue .
wsj_0820	2	And neither Democrats nor Republicans are predicting that the capital-gains forces can produce enough votes .
wsj_0820	3	`` The 60-vote requirement will be there and they do n't have the 60 votes , '' Sen. Mitchell said .
wsj_0820	4	`` They do n't have the votes to get it passed . ''
wsj_0820	5	Sen. Bob Packwood R. , Ore. , the leading Republican proponent of the tax cut , did n't disagree .
wsj_0820	6	`` I 'm not sure what 's going to happen , '' he said .
wsj_0820	7	Previously he had said he would be able to find the requisite 60 votes eventually .
wsj_0820	8	Sen. Packwood has offered his capital-gains-cut package as an amendment to a bill , now pending in the Senate , that would authorize aid to Poland and Hungary .
wsj_0820	9	Democrats are holding up a vote on the amendment by threatening a filibuster , or extended debate .
wsj_0820	10	For a cloture vote to stop the filibuster , Republicans must muster at least 60 votes .
wsj_0820	11	Yesterday , Sen. Packwood acknowledged , `` We do n't have the votes for cloture today . ''
wsj_0820	12	The Republicans show no sign of relenting .
wsj_0820	13	GOP leaders continued to press for a vote on the amendment to the Eastern Europe aid measure .
wsj_0820	14	And they threatened to try to amend any other revenue bill in the Senate with the capital-gains provision .
wsj_0820	15	`` This is serious business ; we 're serious about a capital-gains reduction , '' said Kansas Sen. Robert Dole , the Senate 's Republican leader .
wsj_0820	16	`` The strategy is ` Let 's vote . ' ''
wsj_0820	17	The Republicans contend that they can garner a majority in the 100-member Senate for a capital-gains tax cut .
wsj_0820	18	They accuse the Democrats of unfairly using Senate rules to erect a 60-vote hurdle .
wsj_0820	19	Democrats counter that the Republicans have often used the same rules to suit their own ends .
wsj_0820	20	The two sides also traded accusations about the cost of the Packwood plan .
wsj_0820	21	Democrats asserted that the proposal , which also would create a new type of individual retirement account , was fraught with budget gimmickry that would lose billions of dollars in the long run .
wsj_0820	22	Republicans countered that long-range revenue estimates were unreliable .
wsj_0820	23	The Packwood proposal would reduce the tax depending on how long an asset was held .
wsj_0820	24	It also would create a new IRA that would shield from taxation the appreciation on investments made for a wide variety of purposes , including retirement , medical expenses , first-home purchases and tuition .
wsj_0820	25	A White House spokesman said President Bush is `` generally supportive '' of the Packwood plan .
wsj_0900	0	Marsh & McLennan Cos. said it agreed to acquire the rest of Gradmann & Holler , a leading West German insurance brokerage firm in which it has held a 15 % stake for 15 years .
wsj_0900	1	The transaction , for cash and stock , would represent the biggest European takeover since 1980 for New York-based Marsh & McLennan , the world 's largest insurance broker .
wsj_0900	2	It 's also the first major sign of the long-awaited consolidation in the European insurance industry as the European Community Commission moves toward a single market by 1992 .

wsj_0900	4	That 's why `` we have been working hard to develop a single , more unified presence in Europe , '' said A.J.C. Smith , Marsh & McLennan 's president , at a London news conference yesterday .
wsj_0900	5	Analysts speculated that Marsh & McLennan would spend between 250 million marks $ 136.4 million and 350 million marks for the rest of Gradmann & Holler , or roughly 25 to 30 times the private firm 's estimated earnings .

wsj_0900	8	But most U.S. insurers have n't rushed to change the way they do business in Europe because they believe the European market will still be dominated by a handful of domestic companies .
wsj_0900	9	Under the proposed combination , Marsh & McLennan would gain a majority stake in Gradmann & Holler that would increase over time to the rest of the remaining 85 % .
wsj_0900	10	The three managing general partners would receive a `` significant '' number of Marsh & McLennan shares , said Walther L. Kiep , a partner who would also join Marsh & McLennan 's board .
wsj_0900	11	Mr. Kiep said he sought the combination because `` all our large clients in Germany are becoming European companies or multinational companies and they expect an insurance broker '' to serve them as well in Paris as in Germany .

wsj_0918	1	Du Pont also raised its quarterly dividend to $ 1.20 a share from $ 1.05 , a change that will increase the annualized payout to shareholders by some $ 140 million .
wsj_0918	2	Du Pont , unlike companies hurt badly by sharp price declines for basic chemicals and plastics , is benefiting from its broad range of businesses .
wsj_0918	3	The profit gain was made despite a weakening in the housing market , for which the company is a supplier , and a strengthening in the dollar , which lowers the value of overseas earnings when they are translated into dollars .
wsj_0918	4	The Wilmington , Del. , company reported net of $ 547 million , or $ 2.36 a share , which was in line with Wall Street estimates .
wsj_0918	5	In the year-earlier period , the company earned $ 461 million , or $ 1.91 a share .
wsj_0918	6	Sales in the latest quarter were $ 8.59 billion , up 9.4 % from $ 7.85 billion .
wsj_0918	7	The dividend increase was Du Pont 's second this year , an affirmation of statements by top executives that they intend to increase rewards to shareholders .
wsj_0918	8	`` We have n't benefited the shareholder as much as we need to , '' said Edgar Woolard Jr. , Du Pont 's chairman and chief executive officer , in an interview several months before he entered his current position in April .
wsj_0918	9	The largest beneficiary will be Seagram Co. , which owns about 23 % of Du Pont .
wsj_0918	10	A spokesman for Seagram , the Montreal wine and spirits concern controlled by the Bronfman family , said the company will post additional pretax profit of about $ 33 million a year because of the additional Du Pont dividends .
wsj_0918	11	Du Pont also announced plans for a 3-for-1 stock split , although the initial higher dividend will be paid on pre-split shares .

wsj_0918	13	Seagram closed at $ 84.75 , up 12.5 cents a share in Big Board trading .
wsj_0918	14	Leading the gains for Du Pont in the latest quarter was its industrial products segment , where profit soared to $ 155 million from $ 99 million a year earlier .
wsj_0918	15	The company benefited from continued strong demand and higher selling prices for titanium dioxide , a white pigment used in paints , paper and plastics .
wsj_0918	16	James Fallon , a New Providence , N.J. , marketing consultant to the chemicals industry , says Du Pont still holds an edge in making the pigment because the company was `` first in with the technology '' to lower costs .
wsj_0918	17	He said Du Pont holds about 23 % of the world-wide market , the largest single share , at a time when growing uses for the pigment have kept it in tight supply , although others are now adding low-cost production capacity .
wsj_0918	18	Profit climbed to $ 98 million from $ 71 million in the petroleum segment , as Du Pont 's Conoco Inc. oil company was helped by crude oil prices higher than a year ago and by higher natural gas prices and volume .
wsj_0918	19	In the diversifed businesses segment , which includes herbicides , profit grew to $ 64 million from $ 27 million .
wsj_0918	20	A spokesman said herbicide use in some areas of the U.S. was delayed earlier in the year by heavy rains , thus increasing sales in the third quarter .
wsj_0918	21	In the fibers segment , profit rose to $ 180 million from $ 155 million , a gain Du Pont attributed to higher demand in the U.S. for most textile products .
wsj_0918	22	Two segments posted lower earnings for the quarter .
wsj_0918	23	Profit from coal fell to $ 41 million from $ 58 million , partly because of a miners ' strike .
wsj_0918	24	And profit from polymers dropped to $ 107 million from $ 122 million amid what Du Pont called lower demand and selling prices in certain packaging and industrial markets .
wsj_0918	25	For the nine months , Du Pont earned $ 2 billion , or $ 8.46 a share , up 18 % from $ 1.69 billion , or $ 7.03 a share , a year earlier .
wsj_0918	26	Sales increased 10 % to $ 26.54 billion from $ 24.05 billion .
wsj_0918	27	The increased dividend will be paid Dec. 14 to holders of record Nov. 15 .

wsj_0926	0	Ohbayashi Corp. agreed to buy E.W. Howell Co. , the U.S. subsidiary of Selmer-Sande AS , of Norway , for about $ 7 million .
wsj_0926	1	Howell , a Port Washington , N.Y. , construction concern , was established in 1891 .
wsj_0926	2	It has three U.S. branches .
wsj_0926	3	Ohbayashi officials said the purchase was undertaken to participate in ventures in and around New York City .
wsj_0926	4	They said Howell is particularly successful there because of its membership cooperation with local unions .
wsj_0926	5	Ohbayashi is Japan 's second largest construction company .
wsj_0926	6	Until now , its inability to form membership ties with organized labor has kept it from penetrating the lucrative New York metropolitan area construction market .
wsj_0926	7	The company also hopes the latest acquisition will help secure large construction orders from Japanese concerns with U.S. operations .
wsj_0926	8	Ohbayashi cited industry publications crediting Howell , currently capitalized at $ 2.2 million , with receiving orders valued at $ 225 million in 1988 .

wsj_0927	2	Mr. Schwarz , who is president of U.S. Trust , will be succeeded in that post by Jeffrey S. Maurer , 42 , who is executive vice president in charge of the company 's asset-management group .
wsj_0927	3	U.S. Trust , a 136-year-old institution that is one of the earliest high-net worth banks in the U.S. , has faced intensifying competition from other firms that have established , and heavily promoted , private-banking businesses of their own .
wsj_0927	4	As a result , U.S. Trust 's earnings have been hurt .
wsj_0927	5	But Mr. Schwarz welcomes the competition in U.S. Trust 's flagship businesses , calling it `` flattery . ''
wsj_0927	6	Mr. Schwarz says the competition `` broadens the base of opportunity for us . ''
wsj_0927	7	Other firms `` are dealing with the masses .
wsj_0927	8	I do n't believe they have the culture '' to adequately service high-net-worth individuals , he adds .
wsj_0927	9	U.S. Trust recently introduced certain mutual-fund products , which allow it to serve customers with minimum deposits of $ 250,000 .
wsj_0927	10	Previously , the company advertised at the $ 2 million level .
wsj_0927	11	`` We have always taken smaller accounts , but now we are looking for smaller accounts that will grow , '' Mr. Schwarz says .
wsj_0927	12	`` Our bread and butter is still the $ 2 million to $ 20 million account , '' he says .
wsj_0927	13	The new services allow U.S. Trust to cater to the `` new wealth , '' Mr. Schwarz says .
wsj_0927	14	Quarterly net income this year has risen just over comparable periods in 1988 , when year-end net was below the 1987 level .
wsj_0927	15	In this year 's third quarter , for example , net was $ 10.5 million , or $ 1.05 a share , compared with $ 10.3 million , or $ 1.02 a share , a year earlier .
wsj_0927	16	Assets as of Sept. 30 fell to $ 2.46 billion from about $ 2.77 billion .
wsj_0927	17	`` We will have a reasonably flat year this year , '' Mr. Schwarz says .
wsj_0927	18	Mr. Schwarz also said costs associated with U.S. Trust 's planned move to midtown Manhattan from Wall Street will continue to be a drag on earnings through 1990 .
wsj_0927	19	Mr. Schwarz 's great-grandfather founded the New York toy store F.A.O. Schwarz , but his family no longer has ties to the company .
wsj_0927	20	Mr. Schwarz 's father was a U.S. Trust trustee until 1974 .

wsj_0928	0	Sun Microsystems Inc. , snapping back to profitability after its first quarterly loss as a public firm , said it earned $ 5.2 million , or seven cents a share , in the fiscal first quarter .
wsj_0928	1	Sun , a maker of computer workstations , reported sales of $ 538.5 million for the quarter ended Sept. 29 , up 39 % from $ 388.5 million a year earlier .
wsj_0928	2	In the 1988 period , the company earned $ 20.6 million , or 26 cents a share .
wsj_0928	3	Sun 's results were slightly better than expectations .
wsj_0928	4	Earlier this month , the company said it expected to break even for the quarter on sales of $ 530 million .
wsj_0928	5	In a statement , Scott McNealy , Sun 's chief executive officer , said the company 's performance was hampered by problems tied to the introduction of a major new family of computers in April .
wsj_0928	6	One of those new computers , called Sparcstation 1 , accounted for nearly half of the 28,000 systems Sun shipped in the quarter , he said .
wsj_0928	7	More than two-thirds of the systems shipped , meanwhile , were products introduced in April .
wsj_0928	8	But problems in manufacturing , forecasting demand and getting the bugs out of a new management information system made it extremely difficult for Sun to meet demand for its newest computers well into the summer .
wsj_0928	9	These problems also resulted in Sun reporting a $ 20.3 million loss for its fourth quarter ended June 30 .
wsj_0928	10	Mr. McNealy said the issues that hurt Sun 's performance earlier this year are now `` largely '' behind the firm , and he indicated that Sun 's profitability should increase throughout the fiscal year .
wsj_0928	11	Sun also reported a record backlog of orders .
wsj_0928	12	While this indicates continued strong demand for the company 's desk-top computers , Sun faces increasing competition from Digital Equipment Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co .
wsj_0928	13	Recently , analysts have said Sun also is vulnerable to competition from International Business Machines Corp. , which plans to introduce a group of workstations early next year , and Next Inc .

wsj_0932	2	A genetically engineered version of the human protein developed by Amgen Corp. of Thousand Oaks , Calif. , recently has been marketed by the Ortho Pharmaceuticals division of Johnson & Johnson .
wsj_0932	3	A competing version of EPO is being developed by Genetics Institute Inc. in Cambridge , Mass .
wsj_0932	4	The drug is being used primarily to treat anemias .
wsj_0932	5	A new experiment , reported in this week 's New England Journal of Medicine , involved giving injections of Amgen 's EPO to 23 patients who wanted to store units of their own blood .
wsj_0932	6	The patients began receiving EPO injections about a month before their scheduled surgery .
wsj_0932	7	They then began donating blood twice a week , receiving an EPO injection each time .
wsj_0932	8	If tests indicated a low number of red cells , blood was n't taken .
wsj_0932	9	The EPO-treated patients donated an average of 5.4 units of blood each compared with only 4.1 units donated by a similar group of surgical patients who received a placebo injection .
wsj_0932	10	The volume of red cells donated by the EPO-treated patients was 41 % higher per donor , the research team representing a number of hospitals and blood banks reported .
wsj_0935	0	International Business Machines Corp. made news this summer when it landed an unusual contract to manage all of Eastman Kodak Co. 's data-processing needs .
wsj_0935	1	But the computer giant appears to have lost a second key contract with Kodak to archrival Digital Equipment Corp .
wsj_0935	2	Kodak yesterday confirmed that it has entered negotiations with Maynard , Mass.-based Digital to manage all of its voice and data communications needs .
wsj_0935	3	Kodak , based in Rochester , N.Y. , said IBM also had bid for the business .
wsj_0935	4	IBM is based in Armonk , N.Y .
wsj_0935	5	The loss is a setback to IBM , which pointed to the Kodak contract as an example of its success in systems integration .
wsj_0935	6	That 's an emerging business in which computer makers or consultants provide turnkey communications and computing services to major corporations .
wsj_0935	7	A Kodak spokesman declined to disclose the potential value of the contract , which is still in negotiation .
wsj_0935	8	He said that American Telephone & Telegraph , MCI Communications Corp. , Rochester Telephone Corp. and IBM itself would likely be Digital 's subcontractors on the project .
wsj_0935	9	`` When we decided to look outside the company for critical data-processing and communications services , we wanted to get the best vendor for that service , '' said Paul Allen , the spokesman .
wsj_0935	10	`` That 's why we went with IBM for data center management ... and now Digital for voice and data telecommunications .
wsj_0938	0	Cineplex Odeon Corp. directors said the company 's chairman and chief executive , Garth Drabinsky , is considering bidding 780.6 million Canadian dollars US$ 666 million to acquire the company .
wsj_0938	1	The board said Mr. Drabinsky and Vice Chairman Myron Gottlieb are negotiating financing before offering C$ 16.40 a share to acquire all of Cineplex 's shares outstanding .
wsj_0938	2	The directors added that the two executives have n't reached a final decision to proceed with a bid and that until an offer is made the board will continue seeking higher offers from other bidders .
wsj_0938	3	The directors said if Messrs. Drabinsky and Gottlieb mail an offer to shareholders by Nov. 22 , it will reimburse them a maximum of C$ 8.5 million for expenses related to a bid .
wsj_0938	4	`` We consider that his bid is an acceptable bid , '' said Sandra Kolber , spokeswoman for the independent directors ' committee appointed last May to solicit and review bids for the company in the wake of a dispute between Mr. Drabinsky and Cineplex 's major shareholder , MCA Inc .
wsj_0938	5	MCA and Cineplex 's other major shareholder , Montreal-based financier Charles Bronfman and his associates , have agreed to tender their holdings to an offer by Mr. Drabinsky unless a higher offer is made by another bidder .
wsj_0938	6	MCA holds half of Cineplex 's equity and 33 % of its voting rights through restricted voting shares , while Bronfman interests hold about 24 % of the company 's equity .
wsj_0938	7	Ms. Kolber said the committee had received other bids .
wsj_0938	8	She declined to identify other bidders but said Mr. Drabinsky 's offer `` is all cash , and it 's for all of the company . ''
wsj_0938	9	Several Cineplex analysts have speculated that outside bids received by the committee were either disappointingly low or for only part of the company .
wsj_0938	10	`` All this has really established is that MCA and the Bronfmans have agreed on a price at which they can be bought out , '' said Jeffery Logsdon , an analyst with Crowell , Weedon in Los Angeles .
wsj_0938	11	`` If a bid materializes at that price , shareholders will have every reason to be glad , but the question of financing still remains . ''
wsj_0938	12	Last April , Mr. Drabinsky and a group of financial backers planned to acquire up to 30.2 % of Cineplex for C$ 17.50 a share from Bronfman associates .
wsj_0938	13	Mr. Drabinsky , who would have had the right to vote those shares for two years , said the purchase , subsequently rejected by regulators , was aimed at consolidating his control of the company .
wsj_0938	14	MCA strongly opposed the Drabinsky group 's move .
wsj_0938	15	The directors did n't indicate the source of financing for Mr. Drabinsky 's new proposal , but said MCA and the Bronfman associates agreed in principle to buy for $ 57 million and then lease back to Cineplex its 18-screen theater complex in Universal City , Calif. , if Mr. Drabinsky succeeds in an offer .
wsj_0938	16	`` This is being done at the suggestion of Mr. Drabinsky and to accommodate him , to facilitate his financing arrangements , '' Ms. Kolber said .
wsj_0938	17	In addition , the directors said if a bid by Mr. Drabinsky is successful , Cineplex expects Rank Organisation PLC to acquire the 51 % of Cineplex 's Film House unit it does n't own , and provide Mr. Drabinsky with additional loan financing .
wsj_0938	18	Michael Gifford , Rank 's chief executive , said the British theater chain 's total involvement `` would n't exceed $ 100 million '' but declined to give a breakdown between the loan financing and the proposed Film House purchase .
wsj_0938	19	Cineplex shareholders responded coolly to yesterday 's announcement .
wsj_0938	20	In trading on the New York Stock Exchange , Cineplex closed at $ 11 , down 25 cents , with more than a million shares changing hands .
wsj_0938	21	On the Toronto Stock Exchange , Cineplex closed at C$ 12.875 , off 37.5 Canadian cents , well below the C$ 16.40 level .
wsj_0938	22	`` Where 's the bid ? '' asked Pierre Panet-Raymond , an analyst and broker with Toronto securities dealer McDermid St. Lawrence Ltd .
wsj_0938	23	Mr. Panet-Raymond said he does n't think Messrs. Drabinsky and Gottlieb are `` anywhere close '' to arranging financing and that investors will need a solid offer before the stock begins to rise again .
wsj_0938	24	Mr. Drabinsky could n't be reached for comment .
wsj_0939	0	Two West German chemical companies announced steps that apparently are designed to boost the chemical industry 's standing among environmental groups and the general public .
wsj_0939	1	Hoechst AG 's Chairman Wolfgang Hilger said the company wants to have a substitute product to completely replace ozone-damaging chlorofluorocarbons by 1995 .
wsj_0939	2	In April , Hoechst , the largest producer of CFCs in West Germany , said it wanted to reduce production of the product by 50 % by 1993 .
wsj_0939	3	Mr. Hilger said Hoechst will invest 50 million marks $ 27.2 million in a plant to make a substitute product it has developed that it says is unchlorinated .
wsj_0939	4	The company hopes the new plant , likely to be built in Frankfurt , will be able to produce 10,000 tons a year .
wsj_0939	5	This year , Hoechst will produce about 62,000 tons of CFCs in factories in Frankfurt , Spain and Brazil .
wsj_0939	6	Of Hoechst 's 40.9 billion marks in group sales in 1988 , 200 million marks came from sales of CFCs .
wsj_0939	7	Also , BASF AG , another large chemicals company , said it formed a separate division that will study the environmental impact of plastics and will investigate all possibilities of recycling plastics .
wsj_0940	0	George L. Manzanec , 53 years old , senior vice president of Texas Eastern Corp. , was elected a group vice president of this natural-gas-pipeline concern .
wsj_0940	1	Mr. Manzanec , who succeeds retiring Richard C. Dixon , will be responsible for gas supply , regulatory affairs , and marketing and transportation and exchange for Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Co. , Trunkline Gas Co. , Texas Eastern Transmission Corp. and Algonquin Gas Transmission Co .
wsj_0940	2	All of the companies are units of Panhandle Eastern Corp. , which acquired Texas Eastern Corp. earlier this year .
wsj_0941	0	Adolph Coors Co. said its Coors Brewing Co. unit will test market a new line of bottled water in the West beginning early next year .
wsj_0941	1	The move , which was expected , marks the first time since Prohibition that Coors has sold a non-alcoholic beverage , and marks the company 's entry into a crowded , but fast-growing market that generated about $ 2.2 billion in sales last year .
wsj_0941	2	Coors is hoping to become one of the first companies to distribute bottled water nationwide .
wsj_0941	3	Perrier , sold by Perrier Group of America , a unit of Source Perrier S.A. of Paris , and Evian , sold by a U.S. unit BSN of France , are distributed to urban areas nationally , but are less available in rural communities .
wsj_0941	4	Coors , with its large beer-distribution network , could penetrate more markets .
wsj_0941	5	The company said the water will be called Coors Rocky Mountain Sparkling Water and will come from the same mountain spring as water used in Coors beer .
wsj_0941	6	The company said it will sell the water plain and with lemon-lime and cherry flavors and will package it in 28-ounce bottles and 6.5 ounce bottles as part of six-packs .
wsj_0941	7	The test markets , though not specified , will be in northern California , Arizona and Colorado , some of the hottest bottled-water markets .
wsj_0942	0	Some of America 's biggest trading partners gave a quick thumbs-down to a U.S. proposal to liberalize world trade and reduce farm-product subsidies .
wsj_0942	1	In Geneva , where world trade talks are being held under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade , or GATT , the European Community called the U.S. proposal `` a step backward . ''
wsj_0942	2	And Japan 's minister of agriculture , forestry and fisheries told a committee of Japan 's parliament that Washington 's proposal was impractical and that Tokyo would continue to heavily subsidize its rice farmers .
wsj_0942	3	The U.S. , in a far-reaching plan submitted to the Geneva meeting Tuesday , proposed curbing price support subsidies within 10 years and eliminating export subsidies within five years .
wsj_0942	4	U.S. officials said the plan was flexible , and was intended as a pragmatic approach for gradually removing trade-distorting subsidies .
wsj_0942	5	But the EC reacted defiantly , arguing that the proposal 's main aim is to destroy the Common Agricultural Policy , the EC 's $ 28 billion-a-year price support program .
wsj_0942	6	`` The American proposal is not an adequate basis for negotiation , '' the EC said in a statement .
wsj_0942	7	EC officials say they are irked that the U.S. has set a specific timetable and is insisting on the `` elimination '' of export subsides , not just reduction .
wsj_0942	8	EC Agriculture Commissioner Ray MacSharry said the U.S. plan `` calls into question '' the agreement reached by world negotiators last April in Geneva seeking `` substantial progressive reductions in agricultural support and protection . ''
wsj_0942	9	U.S. Deputy Trade Representative Jules Katz replied that the proposal was entirely consistent with the April accord .
wsj_0942	10	He said he was surprised by the EC 's reaction , calling it `` vehement , even frenetic . ''
wsj_0942	11	The U.S. proposal also was criticized by food-importing developing countries , who said that the U.S. made no special allowances for poor nations .
wsj_0942	12	While many experts argue that food-importing nations would eventually become self-sufficient in a free-market system , the poorest nations are likely to need help in the meantime .
wsj_0942	13	Ambassador Katz said the U.S. was open to discussing particular problems of developing countries .
wsj_0942	14	The U.S. administration said its plan would allow considerable flexibility in determining how and when the free-trade goals would be achieved .
wsj_0942	15	The U.S. argues that its plan would ease the transition to freer agriculture trade by converting certain non-tariff barriers into tariffs that , together with existing tariffs , then would be phased out over 10 years .
wsj_0942	16	But the EC is strongly opposed to converting agricultural supports into tariffs .
wsj_0942	17	The new U.S. package also says countries could temporarily raise tariffs on certain products if they experience an unusually heavy volume of imports .
wsj_0942	18	It would establish procedures to prevent countries from using health and sanitation rules to impede trade arbitrarily .
wsj_0942	19	Seeking to allay European concerns , U.S. Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said in Washington that the new U.S. plan would n't `` put farmers out of business '' but would encourage them to `` grow what the markets desire instead of what the government wants . ''
wsj_0942	20	The EC , with a population of 320 million , has 8.5 million farmers , while the U.S. , with a population of about 245 million , has only two million farmers .
wsj_0942	21	Japan 's objections to the U.S. plan center around its desire to stay self-sufficient in rice , a staple food , even though foreign producers are far more efficient .
wsj_0943	0	Bell Atlantic Corp. said it agreed definitively to acquire one of Control Data Corp. 's computer-maintenance businesses .
wsj_0943	1	Terms of the accord were n't disclosed .
wsj_0943	2	Control Data 's third-party maintenance unit services products primarily made by Digital Equipment Corp. and International Business Machines Corp .
wsj_0943	3	The unit has 6,000 customers and , according to one analyst , had 1988 revenue of about $ 85 million .
wsj_0943	4	Under the agreement , which had been widely expected , Bell Atlantic would be buying Control Data 's customer base and its approximately 100 U.S. maintenance facilities in about 33 cities .
wsj_0943	5	However , Control Data would continue to provide maintenance services for customers of its Cyber product line .
wsj_0943	6	The unit represents a small portion of Minneapolis-based Control Data 's overall computer-servicing business , which last year posted sales of about $ 400 million .
wsj_0943	7	Earlier this year , the company sold a similar unit in Europe for about $ 25 million .
wsj_0943	8	Lawrence Perlman , Control Data 's president and chief operating officer , said the maintenance business no longer fits into the company 's `` strategy to be a data solutions company . ''
wsj_0943	9	Thomas Vassiliades , president of Bell Atlantic 's customer services division , said the acquisition would give the company 's Sorbus computer-maintenance unit added expertise in `` the increasingly sophisticated workstation and high-end mainframe technologies .
wsj_0945	0	Hale Milgrim , 41 years old , senior vice president , marketing at Elecktra Entertainment Inc. , was named president of Capitol Records Inc. , a unit of this entertainment concern .
wsj_0945	1	Mr. Milgrim succeeds David Berman , who resigned last month .
wsj_0947	0	The National Aeronautics and Space Administration said it awarded General Dynamics Corp. a $ 64 million contract to launch the Combined Release and Radiation Effects Satellite in June 1990 .
wsj_0947	1	CRRES is a joint NASA-Air Force satellite to study the effects of space radiation on micro-electronic components .
wsj_0947	2	NASA said General Dynamics will launch CRRES using an Atlas 1 rocket .
wsj_0948	0	Ronald J. Taylor , 48 , was named chairman of this insurance firm 's reinsurance brokerage group and its major unit , G.L. Hodson & Son Inc .
wsj_0948	1	Robert G. Hodson , 65 , retired as chairman but will remain a consultant .
wsj_0948	2	Stephen A. Crane , 44 , senior vice president and chief financial and planning officer of the parent , was named president and chief executive of the brokerage group and the unit , succeeding Mr. Taylor .
wsj_0948	3	The appointments are effective Nov. 1 .
wsj_0948	4	Corroon said it will announce a successor to Mr. Crane at a later date .
wsj_0949	0	An investment company said it offered to acquire Arby 's Inc. , the fast-food operator , for $ 205 million .
wsj_0949	1	The proposal , however , was immediately rebuffed by Arby 's parent , DWG Corp .
wsj_0949	2	`` Arby 's is n't for sale , '' said Renee Mottram , senior vice president at DWG .
wsj_0949	3	The new suitor , Stevric Equity Ventures Inc. , of Mineola , N.Y. , characterized its proposal as the `` first truly independent offer which does not pit one interest group against another within the Arby 's franchisee community . ''
wsj_0949	4	In September , DWG , a Miami Beach , Fla. , holding company controlled by financeer Victor Posner , rejected an offer from a group of Arby 's franchisees to acquire Arby 's for $ 200 million .
wsj_0949	5	Since then , a second group of franchisees has banded together to try to wrestle control of the unit from Mr. Posner .
wsj_0949	6	Arby 's is the marketing , franchising and service company for the 2,100 restaurants in the chain .
wsj_0949	7	Stevric 's principals , Richard and Steven Buckley , said they led the acquisition group that acquired the Nathan 's Famous Inc. restaurant chain and subsequently served as the top officers of the company .
wsj_0949	8	Richard Buckley said Stevric 's acquisition of Arby 's `` would allow seasoned franchisers and food-service operators , with no conflicts of interest , to stabilize franchisee relations and properly refocus the company 's energies toward growth .
wsj_0950	0	General Motors Corp. 's big defense and automotive electronics unit , GM Hughes Electronics , said net income fell 22 % in the third quarter , reflecting declining military spending and slumping GM vehicle production .
wsj_0950	1	Meanwhile , net at GM 's finance arm , General Motors Acceptance Corp. , fell 3.1 % .
wsj_0950	2	By contrast , Electronic Data Systems Corp. , GM 's data processing subsidiary , boosted net 16 % .
wsj_0950	3	GM closed down $ 1.875 at $ 44.875 in New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday .
wsj_0950	4	Earnings for GM common stock , reflecting the performance of GM 's core automotive operations , will be disclosed this morning .
wsj_0950	5	GM Class H , which represents a dividend interest in Hughes earnings , closed at $ 29 , up 25 cents in Big Board composite trading .
wsj_0950	6	GM Class E , which represents a dividend interest in EDS profit , fell 75 cents to $ 52.25 on the Big Board .
wsj_0950	7	The earnings drop at GM Hughes Electronics is a sign of tough times at both the defense operations of Hughes Aircraft Co. and GM 's North American automotive operations , which are a primary customer for the Delco Electronics Corp. side of the GM Hughes unit .
wsj_0950	8	Profit at the unit fell to $ 110.6 million , or 37 cents a share , from $ 142.4 million , or 45 cents a share , largely because of a $ 24 million one-time charge associated with Hughes 's previously announced plan to reduce employment by at least 6,000 people by year end .
wsj_0950	9	Even excluding the charge , however , net fell 5 % .
wsj_0950	10	In addition , GM 's North American vehicle production fell 8.4 % from a year ago , which hurt Delco Electronic 's earnings , a company spokesman said .
wsj_0950	11	That decline was reflected in revenue for the GM Hughes unit , which edged down to $ 2.58 billion from $ 2.63 billion .
wsj_0950	12	In the nine months , GM Hughes net fell 6.6 % to $ 486.6 million , or $ 1.48 a share , from $ 521 million , or $ 1.58 a share .
wsj_0950	13	Revenue rose 3.5 % to $ 8.47 billion from $ 8.18 billion .
wsj_0950	14	At GMAC , net dropped 3.1 % to $ 234.5 million from $ 241.9 million .
wsj_0950	15	The finance unit attributed the decline to higher borrowing costs compared with a year earlier .
wsj_0950	16	GMAC said its automotive financing and leasing business rose 35 % in the U.S. , largely because of dealer and customer incentives used to boost sales .
wsj_0950	17	GMAC profits are combined with earnings from the rest of GM 's operations and attributed to the company 's traditional common stock .
wsj_0950	18	In the first nine months , GMAC 's earnings fell 8 % to $ 859.5 million from $ 930.2 million .
wsj_0950	19	At EDS , third-quarter profit jumped 16 % to a record $ 110.9 million , or 93 cents a share , from $ 95.9 million , or 79 cents a share .
wsj_0950	20	Revenue rose 12 % to $ 1.37 billion from $ 1.22 billion .
wsj_0950	21	In the nine months , EDS earned $ 315.8 million , or $ 2.62 a share , up 13 % from $ 280.7 million , or $ 2.30 a share .
wsj_0950	22	Revenue rose 14 % to $ 4.03 billion from $ 3.54 billion .
wsj_0950	23	Revenue from non-GM accounts was 45 % of EDS 's total business in the latest nine months , compared with 40 % a year earlier .
wsj_0950	24	The company has said it wants to boost non-GM revenue to at least 50 % of its total business by the end of 1990 .
wsj_0951	0	William C. Ballard Jr. , 48 years old , was elected a director of this distilled beverages concern , expanding the board to 11 members .
wsj_0952	0	Alvin W. Trivelpiece , director of Oak Ridge National Laboratory , Oak Ridge , Tenn. , was elected a director of this optical-products concern .
wsj_0952	1	Mr. Trivelpiece , 58 years old , succeeds William Bolger , who died in August .
wsj_0953	0	In the bidding war for Public Service Co. of New Hampshire , United Illuminating Co. raised its proposed offer to one it valued at $ 2.29 billion from $ 2.19 billion , apparently topping all other bidders .
wsj_0953	1	The bids remain subject to evaluation by the federal bankruptcy court supervising PS of New Hampshire 's reorganization .
wsj_0953	2	They are also indirectly subject to approval by the state of New Hampshire , where residents fear soaring rates to pay for the cost of reorganization .
wsj_0953	3	Each of the four parties bidding for PS of New Hampshire proposes a complex financial package to satisfy creditors and shareholders and also proposes a formula to limit rate increases to satisfy the state .
wsj_0953	4	The new round of bidding would seem to complicate the decision making for Judge James Yacos , the bankruptcy judge overseeing the case , because the company 's stockholders , unsecured creditors and regulators each are currently backing different plans .
wsj_0953	5	In addition , some of the proposals are so close , that non-financial issues such as timing may play a more important role .
wsj_0953	6	The unsecured creditors agreed in principle to support New Haven , Conn.-based United Illuminating 's new bid .
wsj_0953	7	They previously had backed an internal reorganization plan proposed by PS of New Hampshire .
wsj_0953	8	All of the bidders contemplate full payment including interest to secured creditors .
wsj_0953	9	United Illuminating 's plan , however , offers more for unsecured creditors .
wsj_0953	10	Geoffrey Kalmus , counsel to the official creditors committee , said that under the United Illuminating plan , unsecured creditors would be paid in full credits and interest of about $ 855 million , accrued before PS of New Hampshire 's Jan. 1988 filing for bankruptcy court protection .
wsj_0953	11	In addition , they would receive some $ 200 million in payments for interest since then .
wsj_0953	12	Mr. Kalmus said that by next July they would have accrued unpaid interest equal to $ 350 million .
wsj_0953	13	Other plans generally would n't pay unsecured creditors ' interest accrued since the filing .
wsj_0953	14	Under United Illuminating 's plan , a new holding company would be formed to own the two companies .
wsj_0953	15	It would be 72%-owned by United Illuminating holders and 28%-owned by current holders of PS of New Hampshire preferred and common stock .
wsj_0953	16	PS of New Hampshire preferred holders also would get certain debentures and preferred stock .
wsj_0953	17	United Illuminating said the preferred holders total package would equal about 60 % of their claims .
wsj_0953	18	Common shareholders would end up owning about 6.4 % of the combined company .
wsj_0953	19	As previously reported , Northeast Utilities , Hartford , Conn. , Monday filed a bid it valued at $ 2.25 billion .
wsj_0953	20	That offer was endorsed by the shareholders committee .
wsj_0953	21	The other bidders , New England Electric System , Westboro , Mass. , and PS of New Hampshire , did n't change the value of their bids , although PS of New Hampshire changed its rate proposal .
wsj_0953	22	New England Electric values its offer at $ 2 billion and PS of New Hampshire values its reorganization plan at $ 2.2 billion .
wsj_0953	23	The bankruptcy judge has ruled that federal bankruptcy laws could be used to circumvent state regulation .
wsj_0953	24	However , creditors and bidders alike concede that the state plays a major role because it could significantly delay final settlement of a plan it did n't like .
wsj_0953	25	The state has endorsed the New England Electric plan , which promises to limit rate increases to 4.8 % annually for seven years .
wsj_0953	26	Northeast Utilities ' plan proposes 5.5 % annual increases .
wsj_0953	27	PS of New Hampshire amended its plan to call for two years of 5.5 % rate increases followed by five years of 4.5 % increases .
wsj_0953	28	Fuel cost adjustments could change the effective rate increases , however .
wsj_0953	29	Previously it had proposed seven years of 5.5 % increases .
wsj_0953	30	United Illuminating also amended its rate plan .
wsj_0953	31	The new offer assumes just five years of 5.5 % rate increases , to be followed by state-approved increases under the usual hearing procedure .
wsj_0953	32	Previously United Illuminating had also called for seven years of 5.5 % increases .
wsj_0953	33	The bids and rate proposals generally assume the Seabrook nuclear power plant , which is completed , will go into operation .
wsj_0953	34	Most of the plans have reduced bids in case the plant fails to get a license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission .
wsj_0953	35	In New York Stock Exchange trading , PS of New Hampshire 's 17 1/2 debenture due 2004 closed yesterday at $ 82.50 , up $ 2 .
wsj_0953	36	The utility 's stock closed at $ 4 a share , up 37.5 cents , in composite trading on the Big Board .
wsj_0953	37	In a separate development , PS of New Hampshire gave 60 managers severance agreements that would pay one to three years ' salary if their jobs were changed or they were dismissed in the wake of a takeover .
wsj_0953	38	It said the maximum cost of the plan would be $ 9.7 million .

wsj_0957	0	Regarding your Sept. 28 Politics & Policy column on the party differences over cutting capital gains or expanding IRAs : Why not compromise now and save the public from the coming infantile congressional political rhetoric that seems to go hand in hand with the process ?
wsj_0957	1	The Republicans maintain that a 30 % capital-gains exclusion will raise revenue in the short term and spur economic investment , while the Democrats maintain that an increase in the top income-tax rate and expanded IRAs will raise revenue and spur savings .
wsj_0957	2	This is a classic example of the old saying , `` The whole is greater than the sum of its parts . ''
wsj_0957	3	It 's ridiculous for a family with taxable income of $ 50,000 to pay the same 28 % incremental tax rate as a family with taxable income of $ 250,000 .
wsj_0957	4	The 33 % bracket should apply to all income over the applicable level , not just the 5 % rate adjustment amount .
wsj_0957	5	It 's equally ridiculous not to provide a capital investment or retirement-savings tax incentive .
wsj_0958	0	PWA Corp. said it plans to sell by spring 1992 all 15 passenger planes it acquired earlier this year in its 248 million Canadian dollar US$ 211.6 million purchase of Wardair Inc .
wsj_0958	1	PWA , which recently merged Wardair 's operations with those of PWA-owned Canadian Airlines International Ltd. , Canada 's second-biggest airline , said the proposed sale is part of a revised five-year plan aimed at streamlining its fleet and shedding debt .
wsj_0958	2	PWA would n't estimate the value of Wardair 's aircraft , which include 12 Airbus A310-300s and three Boeing 747-100s .
wsj_0958	3	But James Ireland , a Miami-based technical analyst with Avmark Inc. , an aircraft evaluation firm , estimated the total `` half-life '' value of the 15 planes at about $ 650 million or more .
wsj_0958	4	Mr. Ireland said 11 DC10-30 aircraft that PWA also said it plans to sell , beginning in 1992 , have a current half-life value of about $ 34 million each , or a total $ 374 million , raising aggregate potential proceeds from the aircraft sale to about $ 1.02 billion .
wsj_0958	5	Mr. Ireland said current demand for used aircraft is strong , partly because surging orders for new aircraft have lengthened waiting lists .
wsj_0958	6	He predicted that PWA would have little difficulty attracting prospective buyers .
wsj_0958	7	Under its revised fleet plan , PWA said it will also increase its existing fleet of eight Boeing 767-300ER aircraft to 18 by 1994 , and add four more Boeing 747-400s by 1994 to the two units that it previously planned to add by next year .
wsj_0958	8	PWA said two of the Boeing 767-300ER aircraft scheduled for delivery in 1990 would be leased out for two to five years .
wsj_0958	9	PWA did n't disclose the expected net cost of the fleet overhaul , but a Toronto-based analyst estimated it at about $ 450 million US , excluding replacement costs for the 11 DC10-30 aircraft that PWA plans to sell , and purchase costs for as many as 17 Airbus 320-200 aircraft that PWA previously ordered .
wsj_0958	10	`` I do n't see this as a debt reduction exercise .
wsj_0958	11	It 's focused on streamlining '' PWA 's fleet in a bid to cut training and aircraft servicing costs , the analyst said .
wsj_0958	12	PWA 's long-term debt and capital lease obligations rose to C$ 1.24 billion at the end of the second quarter , nearly double the year-earlier figure , reflecting debt absorbed under the Wardair purchase .
wsj_0958	13	PWA said it also expects to announce by Tuesday whether it will take delivery of all 17 Airbus 320-200 aircraft it previously ordered .
wsj_0958	14	The first five leased units were to be delivered in 1991 .

wsj_0960	0	The recent bids for United and American Airlines have led Congress to move with supersonic speed to protect incumbent airline managements .
wsj_0960	1	The House is scheduled to vote today on an anti-airline-takeover bill that would block , for up to 50 days , any bid for 15 % or more of a U.S. airline , even a straight cash purchase .
wsj_0960	2	Transportation Secretary Sam Skinner , who earlier fueled the anti-takeover fires with his quasi-xenophobic attacks on foreign investment in U.S. carriers , now says the bill would further disturb the jittery capital markets .
wsj_0960	3	Texas Rep. Steve Bartlett , who has 40,000 American Airlines workers in his district , says the bill is `` good politics , but bad law . ''
wsj_0960	4	It is ironic that at a time when America 's partial airline deregulation is being emulated by governments from New Zealand to Ethiopia , so many in Congress favor an incumbent-protection program for airlines that would be more appropriate for the Soviet airline , Aeroflot .
wsj_0961	0	Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told Congress that the Fed can wipe out inflation without causing a recession , but he said doing so will inflict some short-term pain and will require reducing the federal deficit sharply .
wsj_0961	1	Mr. Greenspan said he and other Fed governors endorse a bill by Rep. Stephen Neal D. , N.C. that would require the Fed to pursue policies aimed at eliminating inflation within five years .
wsj_0961	2	`` Such a deadline is attainable , but it would have costs , '' Mr. Greenspan told Rep. Neal 's monetary policy subcommittee .
wsj_0961	3	The Fed chief opposed a bill - introduced by Reps. Lee Hamilton D. , Ind. and Byron Dorgan D. , N.D. -- that , among other things , would require the Fed to disclose all monetary policy moves immediately and increase outside scrutiny of the Fed .
wsj_0961	4	In responding to questions , Mr. Greenspan played down reports of tension between the Fed and the Treasury over exchange-rate policy .
wsj_0961	5	`` What seem to be interpreted as great conflicts are relatively minor issues of tactics , '' he said .
wsj_0961	6	He did n't elaborate .
wsj_0961	7	But the Fed is n't enthusiastic about Treasury efforts to bring down the value of the dollar through intervention in foreign-exchange markets , and the Treasury is frustrated at the Fed 's reluctance to cut interest rates to pull down the dollar 's value .
wsj_0961	8	Mr. Greenspan said the inflation rate , currently about 4 1/2 % , `` could be brought down to levels which are close to zero without putting the economy into a recession , but I do suspect that there might be some modest loss of economic output . ''
wsj_0961	9	In other words , economic growth would be lower and unemployment would be higher for a few years .
wsj_0961	10	But Mr. Greenspan , who has repeatedly said the Fed 's goal is to reduce inflation , added that `` whatever losses are incurred in the pursuing of price stability would surely be more than made up in increased output thereafter . ''
wsj_0961	11	He warned that Fed efforts to conquer inflation would fail -- and could produce `` a major financial crunch '' -- unless they are accompanied by a significant reduction in the federal deficit , which causes the government to borrow heavily .
wsj_0961	12	Rep. Neal 's bill originally called on the Fed to reduce the inflation rate by one percentage point a year for five years and to maintain a zero inflation rate thereafter .
wsj_0961	13	He altered the wording to win Mr. Greenspan 's endorsement .
wsj_0961	14	Even so , his bill is given little chance of passage .
wsj_0961	15	Reps. Hamilton and Dorgan also have altered their bill , dropping a proposal to add the Treasury secretary to the 12-member Fed committee that makes monetary policy .
wsj_0961	16	Instead , the bill simply calls for twice-a-year meetings between the committee and top administration officials .
wsj_0961	17	Even that met with Mr. Greenspan 's disapproval because it might subject the Fed `` to a more intensely political perspective '' and `` could risk bending monetary policy away from long-term strategic goals . ''
wsj_0961	18	While each of the Hamilton-Dorgan proposals represents only a small step , together they would erode the Fed 's independence , Mr. Greenspan said .
wsj_0961	19	Mr. Greenspan also said that although he favors cutting capital-gains taxes as sound economic policy , he would oppose such a move if it would undo the political compromise embodied in the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and result in higher marginal income tax rates .
wsj_0962	0	Sears , Roebuck & Co. signed a contract with Bob Vila , the former host of the popular public television program `` This Old House , '' to star in a half-hour home improvement show sponsored by the giant retailer .
wsj_0962	1	The do-it-yourself show , slated to start airing by June 1990 , marks Sears 's entry into the burgeoning market of home repair television programs and could bolster sales of its home improvement products .
wsj_0962	2	In recent months , sales of home improvement items have sagged , along with sales of other big ticket durable goods .
wsj_0962	3	The show also signals Mr. Vila 's return as a television celebrity .
wsj_0962	4	Earlier this year , public television station WGBH in Boston fired Mr. Vila after a sponsor protested some of his numerous commercial endorsements .
wsj_0962	5	With Mr. Vila as host , `` This Old House '' became one of the Public Broadcasting Service 's top 10 programs , airing weekly on about 300 of the network 's stations and seen by an average of 12 million viewers .
wsj_0962	6	But Home Depot Inc. , an Atlanta-based home center chain , objected when Mr. Vila started doing commercial endorsements for Rickel Home Centers , a New Jersey building supply company that competes with Home Depot in some markets .
wsj_0962	7	`` I 'm ecstatic about the change , '' said Mr. Vila , whose new syndicated program is called `` Home Again with Bob Vila . ''
wsj_0962	8	In an interview , Mr. Vila criticized his old show , which is continuing with a new host .
wsj_0962	9	`` Public TV is in fantasy land , '' he said .
wsj_0962	10	`` Last season , we did a story that involved spending $ 700,000 in converting a two-family house into a bed and breakfast . ''
wsj_0962	11	In the new show , he said , `` we 're going to spend $ 60,000 building a start-up house '' for a young couple .
wsj_0962	12	While Sears would n't comment on the brouhaha over Mr. Vila 's commercial endorsements , it appears to be building a fence around Mr. Vila 's affections .
wsj_0962	13	His contract makes him `` exclusive '' spokesman for Sears 's home improvement marketing campaigns .
wsj_0962	14	Ogilvy & Mather in Chicago , a unit of WPP Group PLC , will handle the advertising account and syndication .
wsj_0962	15	The only other endorsement permitted by the contract involves a series of Time-Life home improvement and repair books .
wsj_0962	16	His other agreements to promote products have expired .
wsj_0962	17	Little matter for Mr. Vila , who complains that `` public TV never paid me more than $ 40,000 a year . ''
wsj_0962	18	He said his compensation under the Sears contract is `` a multimillion dollar deal .

wsj_0965	0	Financial markets took a midweek break from their recent wild gyrations with stock prices falling modestly , bond prices posting tiny gains and the dollar almost unchanged .
wsj_0965	1	The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 5.94 points to 2653.28 in moderate trading .
wsj_0965	2	Long-term Treasury bonds rose slightly despite the arrival on the market of $ 4.52 billion in 30-year bonds offered by the Resolution Funding Corp. as part of the government 's bailout of the savings and loan industry .
wsj_0965	3	The dollar was barely changed against the West German mark and up marginally against the Japanese yen .
wsj_0965	4	Yesterday 's sluggish action was in marked contrast to the rearing and plunging of stock prices Tuesday after the proposed buy-out of UAL Corp. once again collapsed .
wsj_0965	5	Traders said the stock market 's lurching moves have prompted many investors to head for the sidelines until it regains some semblance of stability .
wsj_0965	6	Although bond prices were n't as volatile on Tuesday trading as stock prices , traders nevertheless said action also was much slower yesterday in the Treasury market .
wsj_0965	7	Bond investors paid close attention to comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan , who was testifying before a congressional hearing , but were n't able to extract many clues about the future course of the Fed 's monetary policy .
wsj_0965	8	Many analysts are expecting the Fed to lower interest rates at least once more before the end of the year .
wsj_0965	9	Investors now are awaiting today 's release of the preliminary estimate of third-quarter gross national product .
wsj_0965	10	Economists predict the report will show economic growth of about 2.5 % in the third quarter , which would have little effect on financial markets .
wsj_0965	11	But an unexpected deviation either way could roil bond and currency markets .
wsj_0965	12	In major market activity :
wsj_0965	13	Stock prices slipped lower in moderate trading .
wsj_0965	14	Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 155.7 million shares .

wsj_0965	18	The yield on the issue stood at 7.88 % .
wsj_0965	19	The dollar was virtually unchanged .

wsj_0967	0	Mercedes-Benz of North America Inc. , a unit of Daimler-Benz AG , paid Massachusetts $ 9.1 million in taxes , bringing to an end a 10-month-long corporate tax chase .
wsj_0967	1	Officials at the Department of Revenue had dogged the foreign car maker for taxes owed on business transactions and were proceeding to settle the dispute in court .
wsj_0967	2	But `` the check arrived in the mail , '' said Stephen Kidder , Massachusetts Commissioner of Revenue .
wsj_0967	3	Mercedes-Benz , which had said it did n't owe taxes to Massachusetts partly because it sells its cars at a dock in Baltimore and not in Massachusetts , did n't explain its change of heart .
wsj_0967	4	Last month , Mercedes-Benz executives approached state revenue officials complaining about bad press , the commissioner said .
wsj_0967	5	The dispute was the subject of a Wall Street Journal article in August .
wsj_0967	6	The amount covers taxes , interest and penalties owed from 1966 , when the state began collecting corporate taxes , to 1985 .
wsj_0967	7	Mercedes-Benz also agreed to pay taxes owed for the years 1986 through 1988 , Mr. Kidder added .
wsj_0967	8	Under Massachusetts tax laws , corporations must pay 9.5 % of estimated profits resulting from business transactions in the state if the company conducts a variety of non-sales activities , including warranties , customer complaints and relations with independent dealerships .
wsj_0968	0	National Convenience Stores Inc. , trying to shake the doldrums in the convenience-store business , said it will rearrange the merchandise in all of its stores in the next 18 months to cater better to the neighborhoods around its stores .
wsj_0968	1	As part of the plan , the Houston-based company 's 1,100 Stop 'N Go stores will be refocused to target black , Hispanic , upscale or core middle-class customers .
wsj_0968	2	Stores in upper-income neighborhoods , for instance , will carry high-priced wines , publications such as Vanity Fair , gourmet pasta sauces , oat bran cereals and Weight Watchers and Pritikin products .
wsj_0968	3	Stores in Hispanic areas will stock an assortment of Spanish-language magazines , Mexican cooking items and candies .
wsj_0968	4	Stores in the company 's core middle-class market will get more frozen and quick-to-prepare foods and a greater selection of bottled water .
wsj_0968	5	V.H. Van Horn , National Convenience president and chief executive officer , said the move reflects the company 's realization that the industry 's poor performance stems from its failure to give customers what they want -- rather than from increasing competition from gasoline stations and 24-hour grocery stores .
wsj_0968	6	`` Convenience store merchandise has not kept pace with current trends in consumer preferences , '' he said in a speech at the company 's annual shareholders meeting .
wsj_0968	7	Analysts and competitors said the move reflects a growing need by the stores to expand their customer base beyond the traditional blue-collar worker who pops into a convenience store for a sandwich , cigarettes , soda or beer .
wsj_0968	8	`` There are an increasing number of people out there who are time-poor , '' said Chris Vroom , retail analyst with Alex . Brown & Sons of Baltimore .
wsj_0968	9	`` Those are primarily white-collar workers , a customer segment that has historically proved elusive for convenience stores . ''
wsj_0968	10	National Convenience 's move is likely to be echoed by other chains , though analysts note that Southland Corp. , owner of 7-Eleven stores , and Circle K Corp. are too debt-heavy to roll out such an extensive effort .
wsj_0968	11	Still , Southland said that its franchisees have been targeting their merchandise to their customers for years , and that the company has begun to follow suit .
wsj_0968	12	For instance , Southland has expanded its bottled water selection in some stores and added fresh sandwiches in some outlets .
wsj_0968	13	Several months ago , it also added black health and beauty aids displays to many stores , a spokeswoman said .
wsj_0968	14	`` We certainly see an increasing trend toward that , '' she added .
wsj_0968	15	National Convenience said it has tested its new merchandise mix in 100 stores , with favorable results .
wsj_0968	16	Analysts said the company 's effort will be helped by its decision last year to put point-of-sale scanners in 200 stores , allowing National Convenience to quickly track items that are selling and those that are n't .
wsj_0968	17	To promote its new strategy , National Convenience said it plans to spend about $ 12 million on advertising for the year ending June 30 , up from about $ 10 million in fiscal 1989 .

wsj_0969	2	Previous talks between Pittston , of Greenwich , Conn. , and the union have been sporadic and unsuccessful .
wsj_0969	3	The union called the strike in April after Pittston refused to sign the UMW 's national labor pact .

wsj_0970	0	One day after Delmed Inc. made top management changes and disclosed the end of an important business tie , its stock did n't trade and the company forecast a `` significant '' drop next year in sales of its core product .
wsj_0970	1	That disclosure came , a Delmed spokeswoman said , after the American Stock Exchange alerted the company that trading would n't resume in its stock until additional information about developments was provided .
wsj_0970	2	In addition to the forecast , the company also said it is examining potential cost cuts and reductions in overhead .
wsj_0970	3	The spokeswoman said the exchange would resume trading of Delmed stock today .
wsj_0970	4	Delmed , which makes and sells peritoneal dialysis products used in treating kidney disease , on Tuesday announced the resignations of Robert S. Ehrlich , chairman , president and chief executive officer , and of Leslie I. Shapiro , chief operating officer and chief financial officer .
wsj_0970	5	They were succeeded by executives of Fresenius USA Inc. and its parent , Fresenius AG , which owns about 45 % of Delmed .
wsj_0970	6	At the same time , the New Brunswick , N.J. , company said negotiations about pricing and volumes of product had collapsed between it and its exclusive distributor in the U.S. , National Medical Care Inc .
wsj_0970	7	Following that announcement Tuesday , however , company officials were unavailable to elaborate .
wsj_0970	8	Yesterday , the spokeswoman said sales of Delmed products through the exclusive arrangement with National Medical accounted for 87 % of Delmed 's 1988 sales of $ 21.1 million .
wsj_0970	9	The current distribution arrangement ends in March 1990 , although Delmed said it will continue to provide some supplies of the peritoneal dialysis products to National Medical , the spokeswoman said .
wsj_0970	10	Nonetheless , `` Delmed currently expects that 1990 sales ... will be significantly below their 1989 level , '' the company said in a statement .
wsj_0970	11	Delmed said yesterday that Fresenius USA would begin distributing the product and that the company is investigating other possible distribution channels .
wsj_0970	12	In any case , supplies to patients wo n't be interrupted , the company added .
wsj_0970	13	Fresenius , a West German pharmaceutical concern , has been discussing a transaction in which it would buy Delmed stock for cash to bring its beneficial ownership to between 70 % and 80 % .
wsj_0970	14	The transaction also would combine Fresenius USA and Delmed .
wsj_0970	15	But the plan now is being `` reformulated , '' Delmed said , declining to provide most of the new terms of the combination .
wsj_0970	16	Said the spokeswoman : `` The whole structure has changed .
wsj_0970	17	The value of the company has changed . ''
wsj_0970	18	Delmed did say that the proposal still would infuse cash into Delmed but less than the $ 10 million originally expected .
wsj_0970	19	Delmed also would receive the North American rights to certain Fresenius AG products .
wsj_0970	20	Another option for Delmed , the company said , is that it could sell its plant in Ogden , Utah .
wsj_0970	21	It added that no discussions about such a sale are under way .
wsj_0971	0	Brooks Armored Car Service Inc. never wanted to get into money laundering .
wsj_0971	1	But July 5 , a thunderstorm in Wilmington , Del. , caused Shellpot Creek to rise 15 feet , pouring 1.3 million gallons of water into basement vaults .
wsj_0971	2	The water destroyed about $ 75 million in currency and caked $ 4 million of coins with mud , rendering them dangerous to counting machines .
wsj_0971	3	The $ 75 million in paper money , although moldy , mildewy and smelly , was exchanged through the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia without incident .
wsj_0971	4	But Brooks was unable to reach a coin-cleaning agreement with the government .
wsj_0971	5	`` We kind of got caught between bureaucracies , '' says President William F. Brooks Jr .
wsj_0971	6	The U.S. Mint would n't take the coin because it was n't mutilated , and the Federal Reserve Bank accepts only clean coins , he says .
wsj_0971	7	The Philadelphia Fed says it is merely an `` agent '' for coins , responsible only for storage and distribution .
wsj_0971	8	`` We issue paper money ; we destroy paper money , '' says Jane Hinkle , a Philadelphia Fed spokeswoman .
wsj_0971	9	`` The coin is their problem . ''
wsj_0971	10	A Mint official says the agency offered to clean the coins for its `` bare-bones '' cost of $ 17,000 plus certain other expenses .
wsj_0971	11	But Brooks declined , figuring that transporting the mucked up money to Washington would cost the company thousands more .
wsj_0971	12	So Brooks gave the dirty work to Coin Wrap Inc. , which came up with an unusual solution .
wsj_0971	13	For eight hours a day for the past two weeks , in aggregates of as much as 27,000 pounds equaling $ 20,000 in pennies , Coin Wrap has been pouring money into a cement-mixing truck .
wsj_0971	14	A giant heater , working like a blowtorch , causes the mud to crust and burns off any wrappers .
wsj_0971	15	After clanging around for an hour or so , the shiny , hot money pours out of the cement chute , where a giant vacuum sucks away the dried mud and burnt wrappers .
wsj_0971	16	After cooling , the coins are then rewrapped .
wsj_0971	17	Brooks expects to pay Coin Wrap a total of about $ 20,000 -- a cost that insurance wo n't cover .
wsj_0971	18	And while the job is half done , Brooks is still bitter .
wsj_0971	19	In fact , there 's only one person involved who 's happy , and that 's Floyd String , president of Coin Wrap and conceiver of the cement-truck solution .
wsj_0971	20	Not only did his company find $ 20,000 worth of work , but when the approach was suggested , Mr. String says , Brooks officials `` did n't laugh at me or anything .
wsj_0972	0	`` Parenthood , '' this summer 's successful and amusing movie about parents and children , apparently was only the beginning .
wsj_0972	1	It seems that every day a new movie opens featuring a child coping with a mother 's death , or adoption , or aging parents , or pregnancy .
wsj_0972	2	Some of our best and most idiosyncratic film makers -- from Truffaut to Fellini to Woody Allen -- have taken a cue from Chekhov : When it comes to compelling drama , there 's no place like home .
wsj_0972	3	Yet too many people working in Hollywood today seem to suffer from the delusion that the drama played out in every home will be interesting to people who live somewhere else .
wsj_0972	4	This is not the case .
wsj_0972	5	Some diaries simply are n't worth snooping in .
wsj_0972	6	Yet there will be people who will sob at `` Immediate Family , '' a limply constructed and offensive movie about adoption .
wsj_0972	7	These are the sensitive souls who can empathize with and even enjoy hearing about other people 's troubles , no matter how haltingly or predictably the sad tale is told .
wsj_0972	8	Written by Barbara Benedek , co-author of `` The Big Chill , '' `` Immediate Family '' takes the position that only rich people living in nice houses should have children .
wsj_0972	9	The film makers have couched this offensive idea in pretty packaging .
wsj_0972	10	Everyone is very nice and good-looking -- the adoptive parents Glenn Close and James Woods and the teen-age couple who decide to give up their baby for adoption Mary Stuart Masterson and Kevin Dillon .
wsj_0972	11	Linda and Michael Ms. Close and Mr. Woods , who seem to be pushing 40 , live in a large and tastefully decorated home in suburban Seattle .
wsj_0972	12	All of their friends have children and they ca n't , so now they want a child more than anything -- perhaps even more than Michael wanted his fancy convertible or his deluxe stereo equipment .
wsj_0972	13	The idea of a child-as-required-yuppie-possession must be motivating them , since the wealthy offspring of their friends are shown to be rude brats , in therapy by age five .
wsj_0972	14	Having exhausted all modern aids to fertility , Linda and Michael decide to adopt .
wsj_0972	15	The actors wear pained expressions to indicate their genuine longing for a little one -- or maybe they 're not-so-subtly commenting on the inadequacy of the script , and Jonathan Kaplan 's `` The Accused '' dull direction .
wsj_0972	16	Or maybe they are disgusted by the literal-minded musical score ; when a character arrives at a major decision her thoughts are revealed by the sound of `` I Can See Clearly Now . ''
wsj_0972	17	The adoption agency insists on introducing the adopting parents to the birth mother , so Linda and Michael pay for pregnant Lucy 's Ms. Masterson bus ticket from Ohio .
wsj_0972	18	Why in these movies is the unwed pregnant woman always from Ohio ?
wsj_0972	19	I ask this not necessarily as a native Ohioan . )
wsj_0972	20	Lucy , of course , is pretty and smart , though uneducated .
wsj_0972	21	Everyone falls in love with everyone else .
wsj_0972	22	There is some pain , when Lucy has the baby and `` did n't know she would feel like this '' and wants to keep the baby .
wsj_0972	23	But in the end , everything turns out for the best , in the film makers ' warped view .
wsj_0972	24	Like lawyers in the hostile takeover field , the baby goes where the money is .
wsj_0972	25	At the other end of the life cycle is `` Dad , '' Gary David Goldberg 's adaptation of the William Wharton novel .
wsj_0972	26	This picture is about a middle-aged son who makes sure that his delayed bond with his father will last by waiting to cement it until just before the old man dies .
wsj_0972	27	The glib emotional style Mr. Goldberg has perfected on television 's `` Family Ties '' does n't benefit from magnification .
wsj_0972	28	His characters practically scamper through a vast range of human emotions , like travelers doing 10 cities in eight days .
wsj_0972	29	They pause only to register little whimpers of distress and sighs of satisfaction , like tourists cataloging the sights they 've seen from the window of a bus .
wsj_0972	30	Not even Jack Lemmon 's expert doddering makes this trip worth taking .
wsj_0972	31	So it 's entirely possible that `` Look Who 's Talking '' is n't as entertaining as it seems in comparison to the turgid other films opening now .
wsj_0972	32	But by comparison , this fluffy comedy seems like a gem .
wsj_0972	33	It starts with conception , taking the sperm 's point of view , then progresses to the baby 's point of view .
wsj_0972	34	Bruce Willis 's best attribute as an actor is his coy , lazy voice , and that 's all you get of him here , speaking for the baby .
wsj_0972	35	Finally , there is one family movie that quite eloquently explores the depth of human emotion -- only its stars are bears .
wsj_0972	36	For the second time , in a movie called `` The Bear , '' French director Jean-Jacques Annaud demonstrates just how powerful pictures can be .
wsj_0972	37	`` Quest for Fire '' was the first time . )
wsj_0972	38	To be sure , one wonders what kind of man is this , who feels compelled to try to understand the most primitive longing and instinct in a way that requires the most sophisticated appreciation of visual storytelling .
wsj_0972	39	Supposedly , he proposed the movie to his producer , Claude Berri , in four lines :
wsj_0972	40	`` An orphan bear cub .
wsj_0972	41	A big solitary bear .
wsj_0972	42	Two hunters in the forest .
wsj_0972	43	The animals ' point of view . ''
wsj_0972	44	But then , even a great many words could n't summarize the extraordinary pull of this movie about an orphaned bear who adopts a parent .
wsj_0972	45	One of the best movies about the child-parent thing in recent years was `` Raising Arizona , '' the 1987 Coen brothers ' comedy that definitely was not about the folks next door .
wsj_0973	0	Westinghouse Electric Corp. , capitalizing on a major restructuring program , expects operating margins of more than 10 % and double-digit per-share earnings growth next year , top officers told securities analysts here .
wsj_0973	1	John C. Marous , chairman and chief executive officer , also said the company expects sales from continuing businesses to rise 8.5 % annually through the next three years .
wsj_0973	2	In 1988 , the company earned $ 822.8 million , or $ 5.66 a share , on sales of $ 12.49 billion .
wsj_0973	3	Since 1983 , Westinghouse has shed 70 businesses that it did n't expect to produce 10 % operating margins while acquiring 55 businesses .
wsj_0973	4	In the past 20 months alone , Paul E. Lego , president and chief operating officer , said the divestiture of $ 300 million of slow-growth , low-profit businesses has been more than offset by $ 600 million in profitable acquisitions .
wsj_0973	5	Westinghouse expects to meet its corporate goals despite a softening in the economy .
wsj_0973	6	Even if the gross national product is either flat or in the growth range of 2 % to 2.5 % , `` we can handle that , '' Mr. Marous said .
wsj_0973	7	GNP is the total value of the nation 's output of goods and services .
wsj_0973	8	A bright spot is the company 's power-generation business , which is experiencing a surge of growth for the first time in years .
wsj_0973	9	Mr. Marous said the business will achieve higher sales this year than the company 's target goal of 8.5 % .
wsj_0973	10	While Westinghouse has n't had a nuclear power plant order from a U.S. utility in about a decade , excess capacity is beginning to shrink .
wsj_0973	11	Mr. Lego said the company foresees the need for a major boost in new-generation capability throughout the 1990s .
wsj_0973	12	Westinghouse also is well positioned to sell steam turbine and gas turbine plants to independent power producers .
wsj_0973	13	The company 's ability to respond to energy needs world-wide will be enhanced through a recently announced venture with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries , Mr. Lego said .
wsj_0973	14	He said the independent power segment could grow to provide as much as 50 % of near-term generation capacity , adding : `` We expect to supply a significant share of this market . ''
wsj_0973	15	Westinghouse also expects its international sales to soon grow to 25 % of total corporate sales from 20 % last year .
wsj_0973	16	The company is negotiating with the Soviets to build a Thermo King truck-refrigeration plant that would produce about 10,000 units annually .
wsj_0973	17	Mr. Marous said Westinghouse would own 70 % of the facility .
wsj_0973	18	The deal , which will involve an initial $ 20 million investment , was struck with a handshake , he added .
wsj_0973	19	Company officials also said that any gain from the sale of Westinghouse 's 55 % stake in its transmission and distribution venture with the Swiss firm of Asea Brown Boveri will be offset by a restructuring charge in the fourth quarter .
wsj_0973	20	The executives did n't disclose the size of the expected gain .
wsj_0973	21	Capital expenditure in 1990 will rise slightly , Mr. Marous said , from an estimated $ 470 million this year .
wsj_0974	0	SHORT INTEREST in International Mobile Machines Corp. fell to 3,102,935 shares in the month ended Oct. 13 from 3,420,936 in September .
wsj_0974	1	Because of an error by the National Association of Securities Dealers , the listing appeared incorrectly in the main table and several highlight tables in yesterday 's edition .
wsj_0977	0	Merksamer Jewelers Inc. , a fast-growing jewelry store chain , filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection from creditors , apparently to speed a management buy-out of the chain .
wsj_0977	1	The filing , made yesterday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court here , follows an agreement by L.J. Hooker Corp. , Merksamer 's owner , to sell the chain to management for an undisclosed price .
wsj_0977	2	GE Capital Corp. , a financial services subsidiary of General Electric Co. , is providing Merksamer management with $ 15 million in financing .
wsj_0977	3	L.J. Hooker , based in Atlanta , filed for Chapter 11 protection in August and has also announced its intention to sell its B. Altman & Co. department store chain .
wsj_0977	4	L.J. Hooker is owned by Hooker Corp. , Sydney , Australia , which itself is currently being managed by a court-appointed provisional liquidator .
wsj_0977	5	L.J. Hooker 's planned sale of Merksamer is subject to approval by Judge Tina Brozman of U.S. Bankruptcy Court .
wsj_0977	6	Rumors to the effect that the Merksamer chain would file for Chapter 11 arose last week in the jewelry industry .
wsj_0977	7	At that time , Sam Merksamer , president of the chain , angrily denied that his company was about to file .
wsj_0977	8	Mr. Merksamer is leading the buy-out .
wsj_0977	9	According to executives close to the situation , Merksamer filed for Chapter 11 to speed the sale of the chain .
wsj_0977	10	One executive said an accord signed by the unsecured creditors of L.J. Hooker Corp. had frozen in place all of L.J. Hooker 's assets .
wsj_0977	11	The Merksamer bankruptcy-law filing appears to supersede that agreement .
wsj_0977	12	`` By filing for Chapter 11 , the Merksamer chain will only need approval from a bankruptcy judge for the sale , not the hundreds of unsecured creditors , '' said this executive .
wsj_0977	13	`` The cash from the sale will go to L.J. Hooker , but the company itself will belong to Sam Merksamer . ''
wsj_0977	14	Mr. Merksamer and Sanford Sigoloff , chief executive of L.J. Hooker , were unavailable for comment .
wsj_0977	15	In a statement , Mr. Merksamer described the filing as a `` legal technicality , '' but also said that `` our inability to obtain trade credit , combined with a need to ensure that our stores were properly stocked for the Christmas season , necessitated our filing Chapter 11 . ''
wsj_0977	16	The jewelry chain , which is based in Sacramento , Calif. , had revenue of $ 62 million and operating profit of $ 2.5 million for the year ended June 30 .
wsj_0979	0	David Evans , who last week resigned as president and chief executive of Qintex Entertainment Inc. `` for personal reasons '' just as the company filed for bankruptcy-law protection , has been temporarily reappointed to both positions , the company said .
wsj_0979	1	Qintex Entertainment also said Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer Jonathan Lloyd , 37 years old , would join the nine-member board .
wsj_0979	2	He succeeds Roger Kimmel , who resigned last week saying his participation in evaluating the company 's role in buying MGM/UA Communications Co. was no longer necessary .
wsj_0979	3	Mr. Evans will stay until a successor is found , but not later than the end of the year , the company said .
wsj_0979	4	It was the 49-year-old Mr. Evans who had moved into the offices of MGM/UA and run the company during Qintex Australia Ltd. 's aborted bid for the movie company .
wsj_0979	5	After MGM/UA terminated the $ 1.5 billion merger because of a dispute over a $ 50 million letter of credit , Qintex Entertainment -- which is 43%-owned by Qintex Australia -- found itself facing problems of its own .
wsj_0979	6	And the relationship between Qintex Entertainment and the Australian company appears to be quickly deteriorating .
wsj_0979	7	On Oct. 19 , Qintex Entertainment was about to default on a $ 5.9 million payment owed to MCA Inc. in connection with the distribution of a television program .
wsj_0979	8	Qintex Entertainment was depending on Qintex Australia to arrange financing .
wsj_0979	9	But early on Oct. 19 , the second of two hectic days of board meetings , Mr. Evans said he believed Qintex Australia would n't be forthcoming .
wsj_0979	10	He recommended that the company file for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code before the MCA deadline , according to a source familiar with the sessions .
wsj_0979	11	But a majority of the board , which includes three members from the Australian company , overrode him .
wsj_0979	12	Later in the day , according to the source , the board reversed itself , decided to file for bankruptcy protection , and asked Mr. Evans to stay on .
wsj_0979	13	Mr. Evans told the board he needed the weekend to think about it .
wsj_0979	14	Mr. Evans could n't be reached yesterday for comment .
wsj_0979	15	Last Monday , Qintex Australia announced a restructuring plan and said it would sell off assets .
wsj_0979	16	Last week the company indicated it would cut back on the working capital it would supply to Qintex Entertainment .
wsj_0979	17	Separately , a Qintex Entertainment shareholder filed suit in federal court in Los Angeles charging Qintex Australia with misleading shareholders about Qintex Entertainment 's financial position .
wsj_0979	18	Qintex Australia said it had n't seen the suit and could n't comment .
wsj_0980	0	The Sept. 25 `` Tracking Travel '' column advises readers to `` Charge With Caution When Traveling Abroad '' because credit-card companies charge 1 % to convert foreign-currency expenditures into dollars .
wsj_0980	1	In fact , this is the best bargain available to someone traveling abroad .
wsj_0980	2	In contrast to the 1 % conversion fee charged by Visa , foreign-currency dealers routinely charge 7 % or more to convert U.S. dollars into foreign currency .
wsj_0980	3	On top of this , the traveler who converts his dollars into foreign currency before the trip starts will lose interest from the day of conversion .
wsj_0980	4	At the end of the trip , any unspent foreign exchange will have to be converted back into dollars , with another commission due .
wsj_0980	5	The card holder will pay the modest 1 % fee only on the amounts actually needed .
wsj_0980	6	Typically , he will be billed only several weeks after the expenditure , and then has another couple of weeks before he has to pay the bill .
wsj_0980	7	In the meantime , the money can continue to earn interest for the card holder -- often more than 1 % during that `` float '' period alone .
wsj_0981	0	MGM Grand Inc. has agreed to pay $ 93 million and nearly 1.8 million common shares to buy 117 acres of land along the Las Vegas , Nev. , Strip as a site for its planned movie-studio and theme-park resort .
wsj_0981	1	Of the total purchase price , $ 50 million cash and $ 30 million in stock nearly 1.8 million shares would be paid to buy the existing 700-room Marina Hotel & Casino from Southwest Securities , a Nevada limited partnership .
wsj_0981	2	The remaining properties to be acquired are the Tropicana Country Club & Golf Course , a facility jointly owned by Ramada Inc. , of Phoenix , Ariz. , and the Jaffe family , and a small parcel owned by MGM Grand director James D. Aljian .
wsj_0981	3	The purchase price was disclosed in a preliminary prospectus issued in connection with MGM Grand 's planned offering of six million common shares .
wsj_0981	4	The luxury airline and casino company , 98.6%-owned by investor Kirk Kerkorian and his Tracinda Corp. , earlier this month announced its agreements to acquire the properties , but did n't disclose the purchase price .
wsj_0981	5	The proposed stock offering and issuance of nearly 1.8 million common shares in connection with the land purchase will bring MGM Grand 's total shares outstanding to 28.7 million , of which 72 % will be owned by Mr. Kerkorian and Tracinda , according to the prospectus .
wsj_0981	6	In over-the-counter trading , MGM Grand was bid at $ 17.50 a share .
wsj_0981	7	Proceeds from the offering are expected to be used for remodeling the company 's Desert Inn resort in Las Vegas , refurbishing certain aircraft of the MGM Grand Air unit , and to acquire the property for the new resort .
wsj_0981	8	The company said it estimates the Desert Inn remodeling will cost about $ 32 million , and the refurbishment of the three DC-8-62 aircraft , made by McDonnell Douglas Corp. , will cost around $ 24.5 million .
wsj_0981	9	MGM Grand said the latest stock offering wo n't cover the $ 600 million or more cost of building the proposed resort and theme park , and added it will need to seek additional financing , either through bank borrowings or debt and equity offerings , at a later date .
wsj_0981	10	Construction is set to begin in early 1991 .
wsj_0981	11	The resort will include the MGM Grand Hotel , a multi-spired , castle-like facility that will include 5,000 rooms and 85,000 square feet of casino space .
wsj_0981	12	The facility will be marketed toward families , and room rates will be between $ 35 and $ 55 a night , MGM Grand said .
wsj_0981	13	The prospectus did n't include many details about the studio and theme park , although conceptual drawings , released this month , show that it may feature several `` themed '' areas similar to those found at parks built by Walt Disney Co .
wsj_0982	0	Investors poured $ 2.8 billion more into money-market mutual funds in the latest week despite further declines in yields .
wsj_0982	1	Assets of the 400 taxable funds tracked by IBC/Donoghue 's Money Fund Report jumped to $ 351.2 billion in the week ended Tuesday , the Holliston , Mass.-based newsletter said .
wsj_0982	2	Assets soared $ 4.5 billion in the previous week .
wsj_0982	3	Meanwhile , the average yield on taxable funds dropped nearly a tenth of a percentage point , the largest drop since midsummer .
wsj_0982	4	The average seven-day compound yield , which assumes that dividends are reinvested and that current rates continue for a year , fell to 8.47 % , its lowest since late last year , from 8.55 % the week before , according to Donoghue 's .
wsj_0982	5	`` Lower yields are just reflecting lower short-term interest rates , '' said Brenda Malizia Negus , editor of Money Fund Report .
wsj_0982	6	Money funds invest in such things as short-term Treasury securities , commercial paper and certificates of deposit , all of which have been posting lower interest rates since last spring .
wsj_0982	7	Individual investors can still get better yields on money funds than on many other short-term instruments .
wsj_0982	8	The yield on six-month Treasury bills sold at Monday 's auction , for example , was just 7.77 % .
wsj_0982	9	The average yield on six-month CDs of $ 50,000 or less at major banks was 7.96 % in the week ended Tuesday , according to Banxquote Money Markets , a New York information service .
wsj_0982	10	One way that money fund managers boost yields in a declining rate environment is by extending the maturities of their investments , so they can earn the current higher rates for a longer period .
wsj_0982	11	The average maturity of the taxable funds that Donoghue 's follows increased by two days in the latest week to 40 days , its longest since August .
wsj_0982	12	`` They 're anticipating further declines in rates and they 're going to get them , slowly , '' said Walter Frank , chief economist for the Donoghue Organization , publisher of Money Fund Report .
wsj_0982	13	Average maturity was as short as 29 days at the start of this year , when short-term interest rates were moving steadily upward .
wsj_0982	14	The average seven-day compound yield of the funds reached 9.62 % in late April .
wsj_0982	15	The highest-yielding funds are still above 9 % .
wsj_0982	16	The top-performing fund in the latest week was Dreyfus Worldwide Dollar , with a seven-day compound yield of 9.45 % .
wsj_0982	17	The fund invests heavily in dollar-denominated money-market securities overseas .
wsj_0982	18	It is currently waiving management fees , which contributes to the higher yield .
wsj_0982	19	The average seven-day simple yield of the 400 funds fell to 8.14 % from 8.21 % , Donoghue 's reported .
wsj_0982	20	The average 30-day simple yield slid to 8.22 % from 8.26 % , and the average 30-day compound yield fell to 8.56 % from 8.60 % .
wsj_0985	0	I read the exerpts of Wayne Angell 's exchange with a Gosbank representative `` Put the Soviet Economy on Golden Rails , '' editorial page , Oct. 5 with great interest , since the gold standard is one of my areas of research .
wsj_0985	1	Mr. Angell is incorrect when he states that the Soviet Union 's large gold reserves would give it `` great power to establish credibility . ''
wsj_0985	2	During the latter part of the 19th century , Russia was on a gold standard and had gold reserves representing more than 100 % of its outstanding currency , but no one outside Russia used rubles .
wsj_0985	3	The Bank of England , on the other hand , had gold reserves that averaged about 30 % of its outstanding currency , and Bank of England notes were accepted throughout the world .
wsj_0985	4	The most likely reason for this disparity is that the Bank of England was a private bank with substantial earning assets , and the common-law rights of creditors to collect claims against the bank were well established in Britain .
wsj_0985	5	By contrast , in 19th-century Russia an authoritarian government owned the bank and had the power to revoke payment whenever it chose , much as it would in today 's Soviet Union .
wsj_0985	6	The success of the British gold standard was due to independent private banking and common law , rather than the choice of gold for valuing the currency .
wsj_0985	7	It is no coincidence that from 1844 to 1914 , when the Bank of England was an independent private bank , the pound was never devalued and payment of gold for pound notes was never suspended , but with the subsequent nationalization of the Bank of England , the pound was devalued with increasing frequency and its use as an international medium of exchange declined .
wsj_0985	8	The Soviet Union should keep these lessons in mind as it seeks to establish the ruble as an international currency .
wsj_0985	9	One way to make the ruble into a major international currency would be to leave reserves of gold and earning assets in a Swiss bank with distributions based on Swiss laws .
wsj_0985	10	Unless the laws determining the noteholder 's rights to payment are independent of the issuer of those notes , however , a gold-based ruble would be as unsuccessful for the Soviets as it was for the czars .

wsj_0987	0	Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Richard Breeden told a congressional subcommittee that he would consider imposing `` circuit breakers '' to halt program trading at volatile times .
wsj_0987	1	Mr. Breeden , in his first testimony to Congress since taking the SEC post , said the agency is studying the Friday the 13th market plunge , including how current circuit breakers affected the market that day and the following Monday .
wsj_0987	2	After the study , the SEC would be willing to consider adding new circuit breakers or fine-tuning the current ones , he added .
wsj_0987	3	Circuit breakers , designed to give the markets a breather in cases of sharp price movements , curb trading of futures or stocks at various trigger points .
wsj_0987	4	At certain points during the Friday the 13th drop , circuit breakers kicked in on the futures market , slowing trading at times .
wsj_0987	5	A circuit breaker that would have closed down the New York Stock Exchange was n't tripped .
wsj_0987	6	Rep. Edward Markey D. , Mass. , chairman of the House Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee , is pushing the idea of a circuit breaker for computer-driven program trading in hopes that would curb `` turmoil '' in the marketplace .
wsj_0987	7	He argued that program-trading by roughly 15 big institutions is pushing around the markets and scaring individual investors .
wsj_0987	8	Mr. Breeden did n't reject the proposal .
wsj_0987	9	After the SEC study of the drop is completed , he said , `` I 'm perfectly happy to work with this committee ... in identifying whether we need other devices , '' such as a program-trading curb .
wsj_0987	10	Mr. Breeden backed most of the provisions in a market-reform bill that the SEC brought to the subcommittee last year under then-chairman David Ruder .
wsj_0987	11	The measure is expected to move through this Congress .
wsj_0987	12	But the new chairman vehemently opposed a provision in the bill that would give the agency the right to close the markets at times of stress .
wsj_0987	13	Mr. Breeden contended that uncertainty over when the SEC might act could worsen volatility in the markets .
wsj_0987	14	He argued that the current circuit-breaker system allows investors to know `` precisely when and where any trading interruptions will occur and how long they will last . ''
wsj_0987	15	Mr. Breeden offered strong support for two other provisions in the bill .
wsj_0987	16	One would force brokerage houses to provide the SEC detailed information about loans made by their holding companies .
wsj_0987	17	Such loans often are used to finance leveraged buy-outs , and the agency is worried that a sharp market drop could create capital problems for the firms .
wsj_0987	18	He also backed a rule to require large traders to report transactions on a systematic basis .
wsj_0987	19	That information , he argued , is critical to reconstructing sharp market moves , such as the one nearly two weeks ago .
wsj_0988	0	In a rare package sale of its real estate , K mart Corp. , Troy , Mich. , has sold 17 of its strip shopping centers to a limited partnership led by New York developer Philip Pilevsky , according to sources familiar with the transaction .
wsj_0988	1	They estimate the value of the transaction at close to $ 100 million .
wsj_0988	2	K mart officials and Mr. Pilevsky would n't comment on the sale .
wsj_0988	3	K mart previously had announced it would report its third consecutive decline in quarterly earnings for the period ended yesterday , the same day the real estate deal was completed .
wsj_0988	4	Analysts are estimating third-quarter earnings will drop between 13 % and 20 % to about 50 to 55 cents per share , compared with 63 cents per share in the year-ago quarter .
wsj_0988	5	It is unclear what effect the sale of the shopping centers will have on earnings .
wsj_0988	6	K mart developed the centers , which range in size from about 150,000 square feet to just over 250,000 square feet .
wsj_0988	7	Most are anchored by a K mart store .
wsj_0988	8	The retailer reportedly will lease its stores back from the developer , who plans to expand the small centers .
wsj_0988	9	The centers comprise a total of about 1.6 million square feet of retail space .
wsj_0988	10	They are spread around the country and include locations in California , Florida , Washington and Arizona .
wsj_0988	11	Mr. Pilevsky , who heads Philips International Holding Corp. , a New York-based real estate company , owns more than a dozen other shopping centers in which K mart is a tenant .
wsj_0988	12	The company is active in office and residential development in New York .
wsj_0988	13	However , nationally , Mr. Pilevsky controls through limited partnerships about 85 shopping centers with about 17 million square feet .
wsj_0988	14	K mart runs 2,200 K mart stores , primarily in leased facilities .
wsj_0988	15	The company typically sells the centers it develops , but has usually sold only one or several at a time .
wsj_0990	0	Senate Democrats who favor cutting the capital-gains tax are n't ready to line up behind the leading Senate proposal .
wsj_0990	1	Their reluctance to support the proposal is another blow to the capital-gains cut , which has had a roller-coaster existence since the beginning of the year , when it was considered dead and then suddenly revived and was passed by the House .
wsj_0990	2	Nevertheless , Oregon Sen. Bob Packwood , the ranking GOP member on the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee , last night introduced his plan as an amendment to a pending measure authorizing U.S. aid for Poland and Hungary .
wsj_0990	3	Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell D. , Maine was confident he had enough votes to block the maneuver on procedural grounds , perhaps as soon as today .
wsj_0990	4	Mr. Packwood all but conceded defeat , telling Mr. Mitchell : `` I sense at this stage you may have the votes . ''
wsj_0990	5	The two lawmakers sparred in a highly personal fashion , violating usual Senate decorum .
wsj_0990	6	Their tone was good-natured , with Mr. Packwood saying he intended to offer the proposal again and again on future legislation and Sen. Mitchell saying he intended to use procedural means to block it again and again .
wsj_0990	7	Although the proposal , authored by Mr. Packwood and Sen. William Roth R. , Del. , appears to have general backing by Republicans , their votes are n't sufficient to pass it .
wsj_0990	8	And Democrats , who are under increasing pressure from their leaders to reject the gains-tax cut , are finding reasons to say no , at least for now .
wsj_0990	9	A major reason is that they believe the Packwood-Roth plan would lose buckets of revenue over the long run .
wsj_0990	10	The Packwood-Roth proposal would reduce the tax depending on how long an asset was held .
wsj_0990	11	It also would create a new individual retirement account that would shield from taxation the appreciation on investments made for a wide variety of purposes , including retirement , medical expenses , first-home purchases and tuition .
wsj_0990	12	`` A number of us are not going to touch capital gains , IRAs or anything else unless it contributes to deficit-reduction , '' said Sen. Charles Robb D. , Va. , who is one of the 10 to 20 Democrats who the Bush administration believes might favor giving preferential treatment to capital gains .
wsj_0990	13	President Bush has been hearing this kind of opposition first hand during meetings over the past two days with Democratic senators at the White House .
wsj_0990	14	And at a luncheon meeting Tuesday of Democratic senators , there was outspoken opposition to cutting the capital-gains tax this year , according to participants .
wsj_0990	15	The trend is making advocates of the tax cut less optimistic about success .
wsj_0990	16	`` There is a one-out-of-three shot of getting it this year , '' said Sen. David Boren of Oklahoma , a leading Democratic proponent of cutting the capital-gains tax .
wsj_0990	17	He called the battle `` uphill . ''
wsj_0990	18	Other Democrats who favor a capital-gains cut are even more pessimistic .
wsj_0990	19	`` There will be no capital-gains bill this year , '' said Sen. Dale Bumpers D. , Ark . .
wsj_0990	20	`` I 'm probably not going to vote for any capital-gains proposal .
wsj_0990	21	The IRA portion of the Packwood-Roth plan is irresponsible . ''
wsj_0990	22	Another significant factor in the capitalgains debate is the extent to which it has become a purely political battle between President Bush and Senate Majority Leader Mitchell .
wsj_0990	23	Mr. Mitchell has made clear to his wavering colleagues that the issue is important to him personally .
wsj_0990	24	Today , Sen. Mitchell and other leading Democrats plan to turn up the heat again by holding a news conference to bash the proposal .
wsj_0990	25	Estimates requested by Sen. Mitchell from the Congressional Joint Taxation Committee show that the richest 100 taxpayers got an average benefit from the capital-gains differential of $ 13 million each in 1985 , the last year for which figures are available .
wsj_0990	26	White House officials acknowledged yesterday that Democrats still are reluctant to publicly express support for the Packwood-Roth capital gains proposal because they are loath to buck Sen. Mitchell .
wsj_0990	27	As a result , the officials said they are open to making a variety of deals with Senate Democrats to win their support for a capital-gains tax cut .
wsj_0990	28	Democrats asked in this week for discussions with President Bush have suggested ways of `` tinkering '' with the Packwood-Roth proposal , suggesting an interest in looking for a modified version they can back , one official said .
wsj_0990	29	In addition , White House aides think that there are numerous other important measures Democrats badly wanted passed -- such as the scaling back of a controversial catastrophic health-care plan for the elderly -- that might provide the president leverage in cutting deals with Democrats .
wsj_0990	30	A capital-gains tax cut might be paired with such measures to help ensure passage .
wsj_0990	31	Other possibilities include a child-care initiative and an increase in the minimum wage .
wsj_0990	32	If they ca n't secure immediate passage of a capital-gains plan , administration officials also are n't ruling out making a deal with Congress to put off a vote until a firm date in the future , even next year .
wsj_0990	33	But the officials insist that such a deal on a future vote would have to apply to both the House and the Senate .

wsj_0990	37	The Chinese were among 3,372 boat people supposedly from Vietnam who arrived in Japan this year , compared with 219 for all of 1988 , the official said .

wsj_0990	58	The Venice city council is battling plans to tap huge gas fields off the coast that it says will speed up the city 's slow sinking into its lagoon .
wsj_0990	59	AGIP , the state-owned energy giant , made the announcement about the gas field last month .
wsj_0990	60	Located six miles northeast of Venice , the field contains 875 billion cubic feet of methane gas - one-tenth of Italy 's reserves .
wsj_0990	61	Alarmed councilors say the project could jeopardize costly efforts to stop , or slow down , the subsidence that makes Venice subject to regular and destructive flooding .
wsj_0990	62	The council unanimously opposed the idea of AGIP pumping out the methane gas and swiftly appealed to the company and to Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti , who has yet to reply .

wsj_0992	0	Regarding your Oct. 4 page-one article `` Bad Blood '' on the generic-drug battle : The Epilepsy Institute is not just a patient-advocacy organization .
wsj_0992	1	It is primarily a certified outpatient treatment facility providing comprehensive services to people with epilepsy and their families .
wsj_0992	2	The institute 's advocacy efforts are based on the needs of the population it serves and represents .
wsj_0992	3	In 1985 , the Medical Tribune reported that a growing number of critics are challenging the FDA bioequivalence-therapeutic-equivalence equation .
wsj_0992	4	`` They contend it is based on an assumption that has not yet been proven in valid tests , '' the Tribune said .
wsj_0992	5	In 1986 , some institute patients were reporting breakthrough seizures when they were switched from a specific brand-name medication to a generic one or from one generic manufacturer of a specific product to another .
wsj_0992	6	In addition , neurologists were beginning to report these observations as well .
wsj_0992	7	Call it anecdotal if you will .
wsj_0992	8	But no ethical physician would switch patients who were doing well on a specific medication from a specific manufacturer to prove a point .
wsj_0992	9	We do not depend on pharmaceutical companies for our support .
wsj_0992	10	The institute has governmental service contracts for the provision of direct patient services ; collects patient fees ; receives money through contributions from individuals , foundations and bequests .
wsj_0992	11	The funds received from pharmaceutical firms are used to offset physician symposiums , and these symposiums do not stress any particular medication or manufacturer .
wsj_0992	12	The Epilepsy Institute 's reporting of breakthrough seizures stemmed from concerns about the people we treat and care about daily .
wsj_0992	13	This perhaps was perceived as a `` bold '' stance , and thus suspicious .
wsj_0992	14	But let us not confuse profits of big business masquerading as concerns for people 's health care or for the cost .
wsj_0992	15	For whom is the saving ?
wsj_0992	16	Surely not to people with epilepsy who depend on the same levels of medication in their bloodstream daily to maintain seizure control .

wsj_0996	5	President Bush told reporters a few months ago that he was looking for the right test case to see whether he already has the line-item veto .
wsj_0996	6	Vice President Quayle and Budget Director Darman said recently they 've joined the search .
wsj_0996	7	On Tuesday , the subject came up again when Marlin Fitzwater explained the constitutional argument based on the provisions above to the White House press corps .
wsj_0996	8	President Bush does n't have any provision in mind , but line-item-veto bait will be like earthworms at midnight in the coming Continuing Resolution .
wsj_0996	9	The harder question is whether anyone yet understands that Mr. Bush 's fight for his constitutional prerogatives is about politics as much as it is about law .
wsj_0996	10	We have been persuaded by the constitutional argument for the inherent line-item veto since 1987 , when lawyer Stephen Glazier first made the case on this page .
wsj_0996	11	The 1974 budget `` reform , '' passed over President Nixon 's veto , took away the presidential impoundment power , thereby introducing monstrous CRs and eviscerating the presidential veto .
wsj_0996	12	Mr. Glazier discovered that the Founders had worried that Congress might take the President out of the loop .
wsj_0996	13	Article I , Section 7 , Clause 3 says that whether it 's called an `` order , resolution or vote '' or anything else , Presidents must have the chance to veto .
wsj_0996	14	Labeling an omnibus budget a `` bill '' ca n't deprive the President of his power to veto items .
wsj_0996	15	Finding a test case should n't be hard , but there is something to be said for picking the best one possible .
wsj_0996	16	The White House had the perfect case , but Congress blinked before it could go to court .
wsj_0996	17	After the HUD and S&L stories broke , some Congressmen began to worry that their influence peddling at executive-branch and independent agencies might some day get them in trouble .
wsj_0996	18	They worried about an Interior Department directive to log all communications with Members or their staffs .
wsj_0996	19	Congress inserted the following into the Interior appropriation : `` None of the funds available under this title may be used to prepare reports on contacts between employees of the Dept. of the Interior and Members and committees of Congress and their staff . ''
wsj_0996	20	The White House warned that this would be an unconstitutional usurpation of its power .
wsj_0996	21	When it threatened to use this provision as the test for a line-item veto , Congress caved .
wsj_0996	22	The fear Congress has of any line-item-veto test led Members to add the single most contorted and ridiculous provision this year , `` This section shall be effective only on Oct. 1 , 1989 . ''
wsj_0996	23	This means Interior contacts can not be logged only on one day -- a Sunday that had already passed .
wsj_0996	24	If the White House is looking for another unconstitutional bill , Rep. John Dingell is trying again to raise the Fairness Doctrine from the dead .
wsj_0996	25	President Reagan vetoed this as a First Amendment violation .
wsj_0996	26	The `` Fairness '' Doctrine 's enthusiasts are incumbents in the House who know the rules squelch lively discussions on broadcasts , deterring feisty challengers .
wsj_0996	27	There are also other provisions requiring Congressmen to join treaty-negotiating teams and new restrictions on OMB .
wsj_0996	28	Unconstitutional bills make good legal targets , but the line-item veto is better understood as a political opportunity than as mere fodder for lawyers .
wsj_0996	29	Commenting on the budget mess this week , President Bush said : `` The perception out there is that it 's the fault of Congress .
wsj_0996	30	And you can look to the leadership and ask them why that is the perception of the American people . ''
wsj_0996	31	Now 's the time to make the political case that Presidents need the line-item weapon to restore discipline to the budget .
wsj_0996	32	Congress is in no position to naysay Mr. Bush now that we 're into Gramm-Rudman 's sequestration .
wsj_0996	33	Just this week , the House-Senate conference met -- 231 conferees , divided into 26 different subconferences .
wsj_0996	34	Senator Daniel Inouye agreed to close some bases in Hawaii in exchange for such goodies as $ 11 million for a parking lot at Walter Reed Hospital .
wsj_0996	35	Conference negotiator Rep. Bill Hefner pulled down $ 40 million in military bases for North Carolina and graciously allowed Senator James Sasser $ 70 million for bases in Tennessee .
wsj_0996	36	President Bush should take the Constitution in one hand and a budget ax in the other and get to work .
wsj_0996	37	He should chop out both unconstitutional provisions and budget pork .
wsj_0996	38	Congress may have lost any sense of discipline , but that does n't mean the country must learn to live forever with this mess .
wsj_0996	39	President Bush has the power to change how Washington works , if only he will use it .
wsj_0997	0	Troubled SCI Television Inc. proposed to restructure much of its $ 1.3 billion in debt to buy time to sell assets and pay its obligations .
wsj_0997	1	The leveraged buy-out firm of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. , which owns 46 % of the common equity of SCI TV , indicated in the debt plan that it would reduce its equity stake to 15 % , giving the rest of its stake to bondholders in the restructuring .
wsj_0997	2	KKR also signaled to the company 's creditors that Henry Kravis and other KKR directors of SCI TV would resign from the board once the restructuring is completed and forgo their voting rights .
wsj_0997	3	Holders of SCI TV 's $ 507 million of high-yield junk bonds are being asked to forgive a lot of debt in exchange for taking a 39 % equity stake in SCI TV .
wsj_0997	4	They immediately termed the proposal inadequate and said the restructuring would not solve the company 's problems .
wsj_0997	5	`` I think the current plan is sufficiently flawed in a sufficient number of bondholders ' eyes that substantial revisions will be required to get it done , '' says analyst Craig Davis of R.D. Smith & Co. here .
wsj_0997	6	Investors interpreted the KKR move as a desire by the firm to wash its hands of SCI TV .
wsj_0997	7	But a spokesman for KKR says that with only a 15 % equity stake , it would n't be appropriate for KKR to keep board representation .
wsj_0997	8	KKR already has made about $ 1 billion of gains from earlier transactions with SCI TV , thus it is n't significantly affected by the company 's troubles .
wsj_0997	9	SCI TV , which is controlled by Nashville , Tenn. , entrepreneur George Gillett , owns six TV stations , including several CBS Inc. affiliates .
wsj_0997	10	It is having trouble meeting its debt payments because of heavy borrowing in 1987 for a leveraged buy-out .
wsj_0997	11	Through investment banker Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. , SCI TV is offering to exchange three classes of junk bonds for packages of new bonds and equity that investors value at ranges from 20 cents to 70 cents on the dollar .
wsj_0997	12	KKR would give up a 31 % equity stake to bondholders , while Mr. Gillett would surrender an 8 % stake .
wsj_0997	13	While one big SCI TV investor thinks that 's pretty generous , many junkholders had been hoping that KKR and Mr. Gillett would invest new money in SCI TV .
wsj_0997	14	Those investors think SCI TV needs new equity to survive .
wsj_0997	15	SCI TV 's debt restructuring plan would defer payment of $ 153 million of bank debt .
wsj_0997	16	It also would defer interest and principal on junk bonds that have fallen due ; the grace period for paying the bill expires Nov. 16 .
wsj_0997	17	At the same time , investors estimate the restructuring would cut the company 's annual cash interest bill from about $ 90 million to $ 85 million .
wsj_0997	18	Yet to pay that interest bill , analysts say SCI TV will only produce about $ 80 million to $ 90 million of cash flow a year .

wsj_0998	1	THE NORTHEAST office market is feeling serious aftereffects of the giddy overbuilding of the 1980s .
wsj_0998	2	Foreclosures and other signs of financial distress , most often associated with the real estate market in the Southwest , are surfacing in the suburban office market of the once thriving Northeast .
wsj_0998	3	Some projects are now in the hands of lenders , including a 425,000-square-foot office facility in Little Falls , N.J .
wsj_0998	4	The owners of a 32-acre hotel and office complex in King of Prussia , Pa. , have advertised for new financing .
wsj_0998	5	Rising office vacancy rates in Fairfield County , Conn. , have builders and bankers scrambling to restructure loans .
wsj_0998	6	And in suburban Boston , developers are bracing for cutbacks in the computer industry , a major user of office space .
wsj_0998	7	Many troubled properties have n't been foreclosed on and are hard to identify , says Albert I. Berger , who heads the Secaucus , N.J. , office of Helmsley-Spear Inc. , a real estate brokerage .
wsj_0998	8	Owners are voluntarily -- and quietly -- turning over properties to lenders through `` deeds in lieu of foreclosure . ''
wsj_0998	9	Often , developers stay on as property manager .
wsj_0998	10	Real estate analyst Lloyd Lynford says the Northeast 's distress is masked by relatively low vacancy rates .
wsj_0998	11	But in today 's overbuilt market , tenants have many choices and are negotiating low rents that squeeze building owners .
wsj_0998	12	On average , Mr. Lynford says , it now takes three to 3 1/2 years to fill new office space , compared with 2 1/2 years in 1988 .
wsj_0998	13	Beverly Hills Comes To Suburban Tokyo
wsj_0998	14	WHY SHOULD the Japanese cross the Pacific to buy American real estate when they can simply recreate it at home ?
wsj_0998	15	Tokyu Development Corp. is spending $ 500 million to build American-style luxury homes in suburban Tokyo with rarely seen back yards , front yards , swimming pools and tennis courts .
wsj_0998	16	The Japanese company hired Richardson Nagy Martin , a Newport Beach , Calif. , architectural firm , to design what the Japanese press has dubbed `` the Beverly Hills of Tokyo . ''
wsj_0998	17	Instead of Japan 's typical small homes clustered on narrow streets with no sidewalks , the new `` One Hundred Hills '' development will offer 65 houses on half-acre lots .
wsj_0998	18	That 's more than 10 times the usual housing site size .
wsj_0998	19	Buyers with $ 6 million to spend can select from 11 designs , including a Mediterranean-inspired California style , a traditional Yankee look and designs inspired by Midwestern architect Frank Lloyd Wright .

wsj_0998	24	Housing Developers Try Brand-Name Buildings
wsj_0998	25	RESIDENTIAL builders , faced with a more competitive market , are turning to a traditional consumer marketing technique to establish brand-name identity .
wsj_0998	26	`` One of the difficulties people in real estate have is that each product is like starting a new company , or starting a new line in the fashion business , '' says L. Robert Lieb president of Mountain Development Corp. in West Paterson , N.J .
wsj_0998	27	So he 's using `` river '' in many project names .
wsj_0998	28	`` It 'll never be like what Bristol-Myers does , '' he adds , `` but it helps establish recognition with the public -- and with banks . ''
wsj_0998	29	Weingarten-Siegel Group Inc. of Manalapan , N.J. , has built Cross Creek Pointe , Allegro Pointe and other Pointes in New Jersey .
wsj_0998	30	Caspi Development Corp of Armonk , N.Y. , has developed two apartment buildings called Classic and plans a third .
wsj_0998	31	Developer Steve Caspi says the same brand name indicates consistent quality , `` regardless of location , design or amenities . ''
wsj_0998	32	The leader in real estate brand names is developer Ara Hovnanian .
wsj_0998	33	His entry-price condos are labeled Society Hill .
wsj_0998	34	Beacon Hill is for `` move-up '' town houses , and Nob Hill , for single-family houses .
wsj_0998	35	Because of standardized designs , Mr. Hovnanian says , `` a buyer can visualize Society Hill regardless of where it is . ''
wsj_0998	36	Quake Not Likely to Jolt The Commercial Market
wsj_0998	37	THE EARTHQUAKE in San Francisco has sent few tremors through the hearts of real estate investors .
wsj_0998	38	`` I think there 's a disease called buyer 's regret , and I 'm sure it 's running rampant at this moment , but it gets cured in a short period of time , '' says Kenneth Leventhal , co-managing partner of Kenneth Leventhal & Co. , a Los Angeles accounting firm specializing in real estate .
wsj_0998	39	`` If I were buying a building in San Francisco now the first thing I 'd do is insist on a structural inspection , then I 'd delay a little , stall a little . ''
wsj_0998	40	But like other real estate professionals accustomed to California 's quake risks , Mr. Leventhal anticipates little long-term change in the city 's commercial real estate market .
wsj_0998	41	Still , local builders are eager to tell the world that most of San Francisco does n't look like the TV images of destruction .
wsj_0998	42	Planners of the Urban Land Institute real estate conference this week hastily added a panel on the quake 's effects .
wsj_0998	43	`` The message is we build 'em right , '' says Peter Bedford , a California developer and officer at Urban Land Institute .

wsj_0999	1	Although their ads picture curvy young people in skimpy outfits , club owners know the future lies with the lumpier over-40 set .
wsj_0999	2	`` It 's a misconception that physical fitness is something for the young and middle-aged , '' says Michael Pacholik , sales manager of the LA Fitness club , Diamond Bar , Calif .
wsj_0999	3	About 10 % to 15 % of members at Atlanta 's Holiday Espre Center are elderly , says Gerald Williams , fitness consultant .
wsj_0999	4	`` Most want cardiovascular conditioning ... the No. 1 way of reducing risk of heart disease . ''

wsj_0999	6	Michael Hays , head of ProBody Fitness , notes an industry `` wash '' is in progress .
wsj_0999	7	`` Clubs need to be run like restaurants where every square foot makes a dollar , '' he says .

wsj_0999	11	`` HOT '' TOPAZ sparks regulator , jeweler concern over import of irradiated stones .
wsj_0999	12	A committee of gem dealers investigates the source of some `` hot '' blue topaz stones recently reported by a Hong Kong jewelry manufacturer .
wsj_0999	13	In the U.S. , radiation limits are set and monitored by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission , which licenses reactors that process the topaz .
wsj_0999	14	The agency is working on licensing importers but does n't currently monitor imports .
wsj_0999	15	Topaz , a translucent mineral that is often whitish when taken from the ground , can be turned blue by irradiation , which transforms it into a gemstone that looks like an aquamarine .
wsj_0999	16	`` The stones that were irradiated in the U.S. are safe , '' says John Hickey , chief of the NRC operations branch , Washington .
wsj_0999	17	`` We believe that the vast majority of imported material is safe .
wsj_0999	18	But there is a small risk that some were imported with high radiation levels . ''
wsj_0999	19	Mr. Hickey added that the stones found in Hong Kong are thought to carry double the U.S. radiation limit , although he noted that double or even triple the U.S. limit is `` still in the range of safe levels . ''
wsj_0999	20	Some jewelers have Geiger counters to measure topaz radiation .

wsj_0999	36	RADIO MALAISE draws the ear of the Federal Communications Commission .
wsj_0999	37	AM radio , which has been losing listeners to FM channels since the 1970s , approaches the 1990s with a diminished voice .
wsj_0999	38	But it may have a good listener in Washington .
wsj_0999	39	The FCC plans to hear a day of testimony Nov. 16 on the plight of AM radio .
wsj_0999	40	The commission believes that improving AM service would broaden listening selections and increase options for advertisers .
wsj_0999	41	The issues are also thought to be important to the FCC 's new chairman , Alfred Sikes , a former AM broadcaster in his native Missouri .
wsj_0999	42	The FM radio band , considered technically superior because it can carry stereo broadcasts , has cornered the airwaves for delivering music .
wsj_0999	43	AM stereo remains largely undeveloped because it lacks a uniform delivery system .
wsj_0999	44	The National Association of Broadcasters in June adopted an agenda for revitalizing AM radio that includes , among other things , pursuing further FCC action on selecting an AM stereo standard and seeking a law requiring all stereo receivers to include AM stereo .

wsj_1000	0	Kemper Financial Services Inc. , charging that program trading is ruining the stock market , cut off four big Wall Street firms from doing any of its stock-trading business .
wsj_1000	1	The move is the biggest salvo yet in the renewed outcry against program trading , with Kemper putting its money -- the millions of dollars in commissions it generates each year -- where its mouth is .
wsj_1000	2	The Kemper Corp. unit and other critics complain that program trading causes wild swings in stock prices , such as on Tuesday and on Oct. 13 and 16 , and has increased chances for market crashes .
wsj_1000	3	Over the past nine months , several firms , including discount broker Charles Schwab & Co. and Sears , Roebuck & Co. 's Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. unit , have attacked program trading as a major market evil .
wsj_1000	4	Several big securities firms backed off from program trading a few months after the 1987 crash .
wsj_1000	5	But most of them , led by Morgan Stanley & Co. , moved back in earlier this year .
wsj_1000	6	The most volatile form of program trading is index arbitrage -- the rapid-fire , computer-guided buying and selling of stocks offset with opposite trades in stock-index futures and options .
wsj_1000	7	The object is to capture profits from fleeting price discrepancies between the futures and options and the stocks themselves .
wsj_1000	8	Index arbitrage recently has accounted for about half of all program trading on the New York Stock Exchange .
wsj_1000	9	Last month , program trading accounted for 20.9 million shares a day , or a record 13.8 % of the Big Board 's average daily volume .
wsj_1000	10	On Tuesday afternoon , Kemper told Bear , Stearns & Co. , General Electric Co. 's Kidder , Peabody & Co. unit , Morgan Stanley and Oppenheimer & Co. that it will no longer do business with them because of their commitment to index arbitrage , officials inside and outside these firms confirmed .
wsj_1000	11	Kemper officials declined to identify the firms but acknowledged a long-simmering dispute with four securities firms and said the list of brokers it wo n't do business with may be lengthened in the months ahead .
wsj_1000	12	`` We 've been opposed to '' index arbitrage `` for a long time , '' said Stephen B. Timbers , chief investment officer at Kemper , which manages $ 56 billion , including $ 8 billion of stocks .
wsj_1000	13	`` Index arbitrage does n't work , and it scares natural buyers '' of stock .
wsj_1000	14	While Mr. Timbers explained he 's `` not totally convinced index arbitrage changes the overall level of the stock market , '' he said that `` on an intraday basis , it has major effects .
wsj_1000	15	We 've talked to proponents of index arbitrage and told them to cool it because they 're ruining the market .
wsj_1000	16	They said , ` Too bad , ' so we finally said we 're not going to do business with them . ''
wsj_1000	17	Kemper also blasted the Big Board for ignoring the interests of individual and institutional holders .
wsj_1000	18	`` The New York Stock Exchange has vested interests '' in its big member securities firms `` that cloud its objectivity , '' Mr. Timbers said .
wsj_1000	19	`` It has never been interested in what we think .
wsj_1000	20	The Big Board also has a terrible communication problem with individual investors , '' he added .
wsj_1000	21	Small investors perceive that `` big operators '' dominate the market , said Thomas O'Hara , chairman of the National Association of Investors and head of the exchange 's Individual Investors Advisory Committee set up after the 1987 crash .
wsj_1000	22	`` The impression I 've got is they 'd love to do away with it program trading , but they the exchange ca n't do it , '' he said .
wsj_1000	23	Big Board Chairman John J. Phelan said in a recent interview that he has no inclination to eliminate program trading .
wsj_1000	24	He said the market 's volatility disturbs him , but that all the exchange can do is `` slow down the process '' by using its circuit breakers and shock absorbers .
wsj_1000	25	Mr. Timbers countered that `` the mere fact they put in circuit breakers is an admission of their problems . ''
wsj_1000	26	Morgan Stanley and Kidder Peabody , the two biggest program trading firms , staunchly defend their strategies .
wsj_1000	27	`` We continue to believe the position we 've taken is reasonable , '' a Morgan Stanley official said .
wsj_1000	28	`` We would stop index arbitrage when the market is under stress , and we have recently , '' he said , citing Oct. 13 and earlier this week .
wsj_1000	29	Michael Carpenter , president and chief executive officer at Kidder Peabody , said in a recent interview , `` We do n't think that index arbitrage has a negative impact on the market as a whole . ''
wsj_1000	30	According to Lawrence Eckenfelder , a securities industry analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. , `` Kemper is the first firm to make a major statement with program trading . ''
wsj_1000	31	He added that `` having just one firm do this is n't going to mean a hill of beans .
wsj_1000	32	But if this prompts others to consider the same thing , then it may become much more important .

wsj_1003	0	Bethlehem Steel Corp. , hammered by higher costs and lower shipments to key automotive and service-center customers , posted a 54 % drop in third-quarter profit .
wsj_1003	1	Separately , two more of the nation 's top steelmakers -- Armco Inc. and National Intergroup Inc. -- reported lower operating earnings in their steel businesses , marking what is generally believed to be the end of a two-year boom in the industry .
wsj_1003	2	Wall Street analysts expect the disappointing trend to continue into the fourth quarter and through at least the first two quarters of 1990 , when the industry will increasingly see the effect of price erosion in major product lines , such as rolled sheet used for cars , appliances and construction .
wsj_1003	3	`` It does n't bode well for coming quarters , '' said John Jacobson , who follows the steel industry for AUS Consultants .
wsj_1003	4	In fact , he thinks several steelmakers will report actual losses through the third quarter of 1990 .
wsj_1003	5	Bethlehem , the nation 's second largest steelmaker , earned $ 46.9 million , or 54 cents a share .
wsj_1003	6	The figures include $ 15 million in costs related to a blast furnace outage and $ 8 million in losses from unauthorized work outages at the company 's coal operations .
wsj_1003	7	In the year-ago period , Bethlehem earned $ 101.4 million , or $ 1.27 a share , including a $ 3.8 million gain from early retirement of debt .
wsj_1003	8	Third-quarter sales dropped 11 % to $ 1.27 billion from $ 1.43 billion a year ago .
wsj_1003	9	In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange , Bethlehem shares rose 50 cents to $ 17.375 .
wsj_1003	10	Of all the major steelmakers , Bethlehem would seem to be the most vulnerable to a slowdown .
wsj_1003	11	It has n't diversified beyond steel , nor has it linked up with a joint venture partner to share costs and risks .
wsj_1003	12	However , in spite of the difficult industrywide environment of high cost and low volume , Bethlehem `` had pretty good earnings numbers , '' said Michelle Galanter Applebaum , an analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc .
wsj_1003	13	Ms. Applebaum had estimated third-quarter earnings of 55 cents a share , but said the losses for the unusual items were larger than expected .
wsj_1003	14	Still , Bethlehem 's core basic steel operations experienced a steep drop in operating profit to $ 58.6 million from $ 186.4 million a year ago , when the industry enjoyed strong demand and pricing .
wsj_1003	15	The company said its shipments declined as a result of a reduction in inventories by service centers , a lackluster automotive market and increasing competitive pressures in the construction market .
wsj_1003	16	At the same time , production costs , compared with a year ago , were boosted by higher raw material and employment costs , which resulted from the company 's new labor pact effective June 1 .
wsj_1003	17	`` We anticipate that steel market conditions will exhibit a further moderate decline in the fourth quarter as the automotive sector remains weak and customers continue to adjust inventories , '' said Bethlehem Chairman Walter F. Williams .
wsj_1003	18	He noted , however , that the company 's order entry has increased from the low levels of the early summer , following the end of labor negotiations .
wsj_1003	19	Armco , hampered by lower volume in its specialty steel business , said third-quarter net income dropped 8 % to $ 33 million , or 35 cents a share , from $ 36 million , or 39 cents a share in the year-ago quarter .
wsj_1003	20	Sales dropped to $ 441.1 million from $ 820.4 million , because the company no longer consolidates its Eastern Steel division , which is now a joint venture with Kawasaki Steel Corp .
wsj_1003	21	Along with reduced volume , analysts said the nation 's fifth largest steelmaker was hurt by holding higher-cost inventory when raw material costs of such key products as nickel dropped .
wsj_1003	22	Operating profit dropped 46 % in its specialty flat-rolled steel segment .
wsj_1003	23	Moreover , the company said higher sales and shipments to service centers from its Armco Steel Co. joint venture failed to offset weakness in the automotive market , higher production costs and a poorer product mix .
wsj_1003	24	Armco shares closed unchanged at $ 10.625 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange .
wsj_1003	25	National Intergroup , which owns 50 % of the nation 's sixth largest steelmaker -- National Steel Corp. -- posted net income for the fiscal second-quarter of $ 8.6 million , or 33 cents a share , compared with a net loss of $ 50.3 million .
wsj_1003	26	Sales increased in the quarter ended Sept. 30 to $ 747.8 million from $ 623.5 million a year ago .
wsj_1003	27	The latest period includes gains of $ 9.1 million from early retirement of debt and tax loss carry-forward .
wsj_1003	28	Last year 's results were hurt by $ 41.3 million in restructuring charges .
wsj_1003	29	National Intergroup stock closed at $ 15 , unchanged in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange .
wsj_1003	30	The company noted that its Fox-Meyer Drug Co. , Ben Franklin Stores Inc. and Permian Corp. operations showed improvements as a result of restructuring moves .
wsj_1003	31	However , its equity in the net income of National Steel declined to $ 6.3 million from $ 10.9 million as a result of softer demand and lost orders following prolonged labor talks and a threatened strike .
wsj_1003	32	National Intergroup is negotiating for the sale of its 50 % interest in National Steel to concentrate more fully on drug distribution operations .
wsj_1004	0	International Business Machines Corp. said it agreed to let Motorola Inc. participate in a semiconductor research project as part of its effort to bolster the U.S. semiconductor industry .
wsj_1004	1	IBM , which made the announcement at the dedication of a research center here , said it invited many other companies to participate as well , including some from Europe .
wsj_1004	2	Jack Kuehler , IBM 's president , said IBM is also considering letting other companies participate in additional semiconductor work but declined to be more specific .
wsj_1004	3	IBM , which said a year ago it was inviting companies to participate in some semiconductor work , has become far more open about its technology as it has tried to rally U.S. industry to head off the Japanese , who now dominate the market for dynamic random access memory chips .
wsj_1004	4	While IBM , Armonk , N.Y. , makes the bulk of the DRAMs it uses , it does n't make the equipment needed to produce those chips .
wsj_1004	5	And IBM worries that the Japanese will take over that equipment market , too , unless U.S. semiconductor companies produce enough memory chips here to keep U.S. equipment makers healthy .
wsj_1004	6	Failure of U.S. equipment makers , IBM fears , would leave it dependent on many of the Japanese companies that compete with it in other parts of the market .
wsj_1004	7	IBM also said it expects to benefit from the expertise that Motorola and other companies can bring to bear on the difficult problems involved in semiconductor manufacturing .
wsj_1004	8	IBM already participates in one industrywide effort to improve semiconductor-manufacturing techniques .
wsj_1004	9	IBM said it expects industrywide efforts to become prevalent because semiconductor manufacturing has become so expensive .
wsj_1004	10	A state-of-the-art plant cost $ 40 million in the mid-1970s but costs $ 500 million today because the technology is so complex .
wsj_1004	11	And IBM said it expects the costs to continue climbing .
wsj_1004	12	IBM , which said Motorola is paying just a nominal fee to cover the 21-month agreement , acknowledged some companies had turned down its invitation to join in .
wsj_1004	13	But it said that was mainly because the project may not bear fruit until the mid-1990s .
wsj_1004	14	IBM said it thought more companies would become interested as the project progresses .
wsj_1004	15	The project involving Motorola concerns a technique , called X-ray lithography , that figures to be crucial to future generations of memory chips .
wsj_1004	16	Currently , chips are produced by shining light through a mask to produce an image on the chip , much as a camera produces an image on film .
wsj_1004	17	But details on chips must now be extraordinarily fine , and the wavelengths of even ultraviolet light are long enough so that the images they draw may be too blurry -- much as someone using a wide paintbrush could produce a broad line but would have trouble painting a thin one .
wsj_1004	18	X-rays , by contrast , travel straighter and can be focused more tightly than light .
wsj_1004	19	X-rays have problems , too .
wsj_1004	20	They can make the masks brittle and can pass through material they 're not supposed to .
wsj_1004	21	But , assuming those problems can be overcome , they should allow for memory chips that could approach one billion bits of information -- 250 times as much as is contained in the four-megabit chips that are just reaching the market and a million times what was possible in the mid-1970s .

wsj_1007	0	Comments by Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan lent some support to the dollar , but the U.S. unit ended yesterday lower against most major currencies .
wsj_1007	1	Foreign-exchange dealers noted that the impact of the chairman 's remarks was slight and warned that the currency remains sensitive to developments on Wall Street .
wsj_1007	2	Traders said that Mr. Greenspan , whose statements are ordinarily cautious , was especially careful to avoid any jarring proclamations , with fears about equities still unnerving financial markets .
wsj_1007	3	Testifying before a panel of the House Banking Committee , Mr. Greenspan said the short-term value of the dollar on foreign-exchange markets is n't the primary policy focus of the central bank .
wsj_1007	4	`` Our essential focus is on domestic policy , '' Mr. Greenspan said , referring to the goals of price stability and a stable economy .
wsj_1007	5	In perhaps his most telling remark , Mr. Greenspan termed the current U.S. inflation rate of around 4.5 % as `` much too high to be ignored . ''
wsj_1007	6	He added , however , that inflation could be brought down `` close to zero '' without throwing the economy into a recession .
wsj_1007	7	Analysts viewed the chairman 's comments as an indication that the central bank is disinclined to ease monetary policy further in the near future .
wsj_1007	8	The dollar climbed immediately higher on news of Mr. Greenspan 's testimony , settling lower in later trade as dealers squared positions ahead of today 's preliminary report on third-quarter U.S. gross national product .
wsj_1007	9	In late New York trading yesterday , the dollar was quoted at 1.8353 marks , down from 1.8355 marks Tuesday , and at 141.52 yen , up from 141.45 yen late Tuesday .
wsj_1007	10	Sterling was quoted at $ 1.6145 , up from $ 1.6055 late Tuesday .
wsj_1007	11	In Tokyo Thursday , the U.S. currency opened for trading at 141.60 yen , up from Wednesday 's Tokyo close of 141.55 yen .
wsj_1007	12	Many traders forecast a continuation of the market 's recent bearish trend and predict the U.S. currency will remain stuck in its relatively narrow ranges in the near term and then shift lower .
wsj_1007	13	But according to Doug Madison , a corporate trader with Bank of America in Los Angeles , a large number of short positions must first be corrected , spurring a temporary upswing , before the unit can turn lower .
wsj_1007	14	He predicts a downward move in dollar-mark trade and a less dramatic slip in dollar-yen , noting that there continues to be a large pool of Japanese investor interest in U.S. securities , which could provide a solid base for the dollar at around 140 yen .
wsj_1007	15	Market participants hope today 's GNP report will offer more substantial evidence on U.S. economic growth , although analysts are quick to point out that the figures may overstate the economy 's vigor .
wsj_1007	16	`` The ` r ' word is looming again , '' says one dealer , referring to persistent concern among some market analysts that the U.S. economy is heading toward a major slowdown if not a recession .
wsj_1007	17	Some dealers note that while the third-quarter figures may appear relatively bullish -- the market consensus calls for a 2.5 % annual growth rate , unchanged from the second-quarter rate -- it would take a significantly stronger figure to alter market perceptions that the economy is softening .
wsj_1007	18	Some analysts reckon that the next quarter 's figures will present a more accurate picture of the U.S. economy , showing a marked slowdown in a number of sectors , including housing starts and equities .

wsj_1008	2	Lawrence Insurance , based in Albany , N.Y. , ) plans to use the $ 22.5 million in proceeds to help finance the acquisition of United Republic .
wsj_1008	3	By acquiring the shares , Lawrence Group increased its stake in Lawrence Insurance to 93.2 % from 91.2 % .
wsj_1008	4	Lawrence Insurance underwrites mostly primary insurance , a company spokesman said .

wsj_1009	0	Levi Strauss Associates Inc. , the closely held owner of Levi Strauss & Co. , said its fiscal third-quarter earnings jumped to $ 128.6 million from $ 31.3 million a year earlier , aided by a $ 69.8 million gain from the sale of stock in a Japanese subsidiary .
wsj_1009	1	The apparel holding company had sales in the quarter ended Aug. 27 of $ 1 billion , up 12 % from $ 908.8 million a year ago .
wsj_1009	2	The company said its quarterly results are now being publicly filed as the result of the formation earlier this year of employee stock investment plans .
wsj_1010	0	Wall Street would like UAL Corp. 's board to change its mind about keeping the company independent .
wsj_1010	1	But what happens next in the continuing takeover drama may depend more on the company 's two most powerful and fractious unions : the pilots and machinists .
wsj_1010	2	Some people familiar with the situation believe that the collapse of the previous $ 6.79 billion buy-out , if anything , may have strengthened the hands of these two labor groups .
wsj_1010	3	As a result , both may now have virtual veto power over any UAL transaction .
wsj_1010	4	One reason : banks -- likely to react to any new UAL deal with even more caution than the first time around -- probably will insist on labor harmony before they agree to put up cash for any new bid or even a less-ambitious recapitalization plan .
wsj_1010	5	`` United pilots have shown on a number of occasions they are willing and able to strike , '' said an executive at Fuji Bank , one of UAL 's large lenders .
wsj_1010	6	`` If you have both labor groups on strike , you 've got no revenue and that 's a very scary thing for a bank to be looking at . ''
wsj_1010	7	Just this past week , a leading Japanese bank asked for a meeting with the machinists ' union leaders to determine where the union would stand if another bid or recapitalization became possible .
wsj_1010	8	Another reason : Emboldened by their success in helping to scuttle the previous transaction , the machinists are likely to be more aggressive if a second buy-out attempt occurs .
wsj_1010	9	The two unions already had significant leverage simply because their employer has yet to settle with either on new contracts .
wsj_1010	10	That gives them both the threat of a strike and the ability to resist any wage concessions that may be necessary to make a transaction work .
wsj_1010	11	Thus , even investors who are pushing for the board to do a recapitalization that would pay shareholders a special dividend and possibly grant employees an ownership stake acknowledge that the unions are key .
wsj_1010	12	`` There 's less likelihood of creating and completing a transaction without the unions ' cooperation and wage concessions , '' said Richard Nye , of Baker , Nye Investments , a New York takeover stock-trader .
wsj_1010	13	Mr. Nye thinks the UAL board should be ousted if it does n't move soon to increase shareholder value .
wsj_1010	14	Both the pilots and machinists have made it clear that they intend to block any transaction they do n't like .
wsj_1010	15	`` The pilots will be involved in any transaction that takes place around here , '' pilot union chairman Frederick C. Dubinsky declared yesterday .
wsj_1010	16	But whether the pilots can team up with their longtime adversaries , the machinists , is another question .
wsj_1010	17	The pilots ' Mr. Dubinsky says his union would like majority ownership for employees .
wsj_1010	18	At the very least , the pilots want some form of control over the airline , perhaps through super-majority voting rights .
wsj_1010	19	On the other hand , the machinists have always opposed majority ownership in principle , saying they do n't think employees should be owners .
wsj_1010	20	Still , in recent days , machinists ' union leaders have shown some new flexibility .
wsj_1010	21	`` We may be able to reach a tradeoff where we can accommodate the pilot union 's concerns and ours , '' said Brian M. Freeman , the machinists ' financial adviser .
wsj_1010	22	Mr. Freeman said machinists ' union advisers plan to meet this week to try to draw up a blueprint for some form of recapitalization that could include a special dividend for shareholders , an employee stake and , perhaps , an equity investment by a friendly investor .
wsj_1010	23	If a compromise ca n't be reached , the pilots maintain they can do a transaction without the support of the machinists .
wsj_1010	24	But at this point , that may just be wishful thinking .
wsj_1010	25	The machinists lobbied heavily against the original bid from UAL pilots and management for the company .
wsj_1010	26	Their opposition helped scare off some Japanese banks .
wsj_1010	27	The pilots ' insistence on majority ownership also may make the idea of a recapitalization difficult to achieve .
wsj_1010	28	`` Who wants to be a public shareholder investing in a company controlled by the pilots ' union ? '' asks Candace Browning , an analyst at Wertheim Schroeder & Co .
wsj_1010	29	`` Who would the board be working for -- the public shareholders or the pilots ? '' she adds .
wsj_1010	30	Ms. Browning says she believes a recapitalization involving employee ownership would succeed only if the pilots relent on their demand for control .
wsj_1010	31	She also notes that even if the pilots accept a minority stake now , they still could come back at a later time and try to take control .
wsj_1010	32	Another possibility is for the pilots ' to team up with an outside investor who might try to force the ouster of the board through the solicitation of consents .
wsj_1010	33	In that way , the pilots may be able to force the board to approve a recapitalization that gives employees a majority stake , or to consider the labor-management group 's latest proposal .
wsj_1010	34	The group did n't make a formal offer , but instead told UAL 's advisers before the most-recent board meeting that it was working on a bid valued at between $ 225 and $ 240 a share .
wsj_1010	35	But again , they may need the help of the machinists .
wsj_1010	36	`` I think the dynamics of this situation are that something 's got to happen , '' said one official familiar with the situation .
wsj_1010	37	The board and UAL 's management , he says , `` ca n't go back '' to business as usual .
wsj_1010	38	`` The pilots wo n't let them .
wsj_1011	0	Delta Air Lines earnings soared 33 % to a record in the fiscal first quarter , bucking the industry trend toward declining profits .
wsj_1011	1	The Atlanta-based airline , the third largest in the U.S. , attributed the increase to higher passenger traffic , new international routes and reduced service by rival Eastern Airlines , which is in bankruptcy proceedings in the wake of a strike that began last spring .
wsj_1011	2	For the quarter ended Sept. 30 , Delta posted net income of $ 133.1 million , or $ 2.53 a share , up from $ 100 million , or $ 2.03 a share , a year earlier .
wsj_1011	3	Revenue rose 15 % to $ 2.17 billion from $ 1.89 billion .
wsj_1011	4	During the quarter , Delta issued 2.5 million shares of common stock to Swissair , and repurchased 1.1 million shares for use in a company employee stock ownership plan .
wsj_1011	5	`` The key to Delta 's record earnings continued to be excellent passenger revenue growth , '' said Thomas Roeck , chief financial officer .
wsj_1011	6	Passenger traffic jumped 14 % in the quarter , while profit per passenger grew 2 % .
wsj_1011	7	Delta has benefited more than other carriers from the weakness of Eastern Airlines , which shares the Atlanta hub .
wsj_1011	8	Although Eastern is back to about 80 % of its pre-strike schedule now , the Texas Air Corp. subsidiary was only beginning to get back on its feet during the quarter .
wsj_1011	9	Separately , America West Airlines , Phoenix , Ariz. , reported third-quarter profit jumped 45 % to $ 5.8 million , or 28 cents a share , from $ 4 million , or 24 cents a share , a year earlier .
wsj_1011	10	The latest results include a $ 2.6 million one-time payment from a `` foreign entity . ''
wsj_1011	11	America West would n't identify the entity , but said the payment was for the foreign company 's use of certain tax benefits in connection with America West plane purchases .
wsj_1011	12	Year-earlier results included an extraordinary gain of $ 1.6 million from a buy-back of convertible subordinated debentures .
wsj_1011	13	Revenue rose 21 % to $ 243.4 million from $ 201.2 million .
wsj_1011	14	For the nine months , America West posted earnings of $ 18.9 million , or 97 cents a share , compared with a loss of $ 9.7 million , or 74 cents a share , a year earlier .

wsj_1013	0	Columbia Savings & Loan Association , reeling from thrift-accounting changes mandated by Congress and the recent collapse of the junk-bond market , announced a loss for the third quarter of $ 226.3 million , or $ 11.57 a share .
wsj_1013	1	For the quarter a year ago , Columbia reported earnings of $ 16.3 million , or 37 cents a share .
wsj_1013	2	Total assets increased to $ 12.7 billion in the latest quarter from $ 12.4 billion a year earlier .
wsj_1013	3	The loss stems from $ 357.5 million of write-downs on Columbia 's $ 4.4 billion high-yield investment securities portfolio , which includes about $ 3.7 billion of junk bonds , $ 400 million of preferred stock , and Treasury securities .
wsj_1013	4	Columbia owes its spectacular growth in recent years to its junk-bond portfolio , the largest of any U.S. thrift .
wsj_1013	5	Much of Columbia 's junk-bond trading has been done through the high-yield department of its Beverly Hills neighbor , Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc .
wsj_1013	6	For the nine months , losses totaled $ 212 million , or $ 10.83 a share , compared with net income of $ 48.7 million , or $ 1.11 a share , a year earlier .
wsj_1013	7	The results include a $ 130.2 million write-down of the securities in the high-yield portfolio to the lower of their cost or market value .
wsj_1013	8	Columbia also added $ 227.3 million to reserves for losses on the portfolio , increasing general reserves to $ 300 million , or about 6.7 % of the total portfolio , as of Sept. 30 .
wsj_1013	9	On June 30 , loss reserves stood at $ 108.3 million .
wsj_1013	10	Thrift officials said the $ 300 million reserve will be adjusted quarterly and will reflect the rate of dispositions and market conditions .
wsj_1013	11	The adjustments result from the recently passed thrift-industry bailout legislation , which requires thrifts to divest all high-yield bond investments by 1994 .
wsj_1013	12	Previously , Columbia did n't have to adjust the book value of its junk-bond holdings to reflect declines in market prices , because it held the bonds as long-term investments .
wsj_1013	13	Because Columbia now must sell the bonds within five years , accounting rules require the thrift to value the bonds at the lower of cost or market prices .
wsj_1013	14	For its future strategy , Columbia officials said the thrift may branch out into commercial lending or managing outside investments , as well as beefing up more traditional thrift activities .
wsj_1013	15	The quarterly results also reflected $ 21.4 million in non-recurring losses from commercial real-estate activities in California .
wsj_1013	16	Thomas Spiegel , Columbia 's chairman , said in a statement that the thrift was `` disappointed '' by the effects of the accounting changes .
wsj_1013	17	But he said Columbia remains `` one of the most strongly capitalized thrifts in the industry , '' based on the economic value of its assets and tangible capital .
wsj_1013	18	Columbia announced the results after the close of the stock market .
wsj_1013	19	Its shares closed at $ 5.125 each in composite New York Stock Exchange trading , down 37.5 cents .
wsj_1013	20	The price of Columbia shares has been cut nearly in half since August , when they traded at about $ 10 , as investors apparently realized that the thrift would be forced to take a big write-down .
wsj_1013	21	The stock 's decline accelerated in the past two weeks , from a price of $ 8 a share on Oct. 9 .
wsj_1013	22	Columbia officials said they do n't know how quickly they will dispose of the thrift 's junk bonds , because federal regulations , such as those that would allow thrifts to continue holding the bonds in separately capitalized subsidiaries , have n't yet been completed .
wsj_1013	23	Columbia officials also said the thrift should n't face problems meeting regulatory capital requirements , despite the large reserves and write-downs and stiffer regulatory requirements that should be in place by year 's end .
wsj_1013	24	Its ratio of tangible equity to total assets as of Sept. 30 was 3.6 % , and total equity was $ 457.9 million .
wsj_1013	25	The thrift emphasized that it has a large portfolio of equity securities issued in connection with corporate restructurings and leveraged buy-outs , which has a book value of $ 90 million .
wsj_1013	26	Although many of the transactions related to those securities have n't been completed , Columbia said the ultimate gain on the sale of those assets will range from $ 200 million to $ 300 million .
wsj_1013	27	Columbia also has unrealized gains in its public equity securities portfolio of more than $ 70 million .

wsj_1014	0	Anheuser-Busch Cos. said it plans to aggressively discount its major beer brands , setting the stage for a potentially bruising price war as the maturing industry 's growth continues to slow .
wsj_1014	1	Anheuser , the world 's largest brewer and U.S. market leader , has historically been reluctant to engage in price-cutting as a means of boosting sales volume .
wsj_1014	2	With the passing of the heady days of swelling industry sales , however , the once-sporadic and brief forays into discounting are becoming standard competitive weapons in the beer industry .
wsj_1014	3	Over the summer , Anheuser competitors offered more and deeper discounts than industry observers have seen for a long time .
wsj_1014	4	Some experts now predict Anheuser 's entry into the fray means near-term earnings trouble for all the industry players .
wsj_1014	5	The St. Louis company said major rivals , Philip Morris Co. 's Miller Brewing unit and Adolph Coors Co. `` have been following a policy of continuous and deep discounting for at least the past 18 months '' on their premium brands , pricing their product as much as 25 cents a 12-pack below Anheuser 's Budweiser label in many markets .
wsj_1014	6	Anheuser said it 's discounting policy basically would involve matching such moves by rivals on a market-by-market basis .
wsj_1014	7	Anheuser-Busch announced its plan at the same time it reported third-quarter net income rose a lower-than-anticipated 5.2 % to $ 238.3 million , or 83 cents a share , from $ 226.5 million , or 78 cents .
wsj_1014	8	Third-period sales were $ 2.49 billion , up from last year 's $ 2.34 billion .
wsj_1014	9	Anheuser said its new strategy -- started in some markets last month and expected to be applied soon in selected markets nationwide -- will mean lower-than-anticipated earnings for the last half of 1989 and for 1990 .
wsj_1014	10	The projection sent Anheuser shares plunging $ 4.375 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday .
wsj_1014	11	The stock closed at $ 38.50 on heavy volume of about 3.5 million shares .
wsj_1014	12	Shares of Coors , the company 's sole publicly traded major competitor , fell $ 1.50 apiece to $ 19.125 in national over-the-counter trading , apparently on investor concerns over potential fallout from the coming pricing struggle .
wsj_1014	13	Anheuser noted that `` beer industry sales volume is 1989 is following the trend that has characterized the last half of the '80s , with sales volume being essentially flat '' while consolidation creates fewer , bigger players .
wsj_1014	14	`` We can not permit a further slowing in our volume trend , '' Anheuser said , adding it will take `` appropriate competitive pricing actions to support our long-term market share growth strategy '' for the premium brands .
wsj_1014	15	Anheuser said it continues to hold to its earlier-announced goal of a 50 % U.S. market share by the mid-1990s .
wsj_1014	16	Beneath the tepid news-release jargon lies a powerful threat from the brewing giant , which last year accounted for about 41 % of all U.S. beer sales and is expected to see that grow to 42.5 % in the current year .
wsj_1014	17	`` Anheuser is the biggest guy in the bar , and he just decided to join in the barroom brawl , '' said Joseph J. Doyle , an analyst with Smith Barney , Harris Upham & Co .
wsj_1014	18	`` It 's going to get bloody . ''
wsj_1014	19	Jerry Steinman , publisher of Beer Marketers Insights , a trade newsletter , said Anheuser 's announcement means `` everybody else in the industry is going to have a difficult time reaching their profit objectives . ''
wsj_1014	20	Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. analyst George E. Thompson downplayed the importance of the announcement , and called any comparison between the coming beer-industry tiff and the seemingly unending `` cola wars , '' unwarranted .
wsj_1014	21	Mr. Thompson calls discounting `` a loser 's game for anyone without a dominant market share , '' and projected that Anheuser 's statement of intent could simply be a means of warning competitors to ease up on price-cutting or face a costly and fruitless battle .
wsj_1014	22	Mr. Thompson noted that the disappointing earnings , which fell five cents a share short of his own projections , contributed to the sell-off by an edgy and currently unforgiving investing public .
wsj_1014	23	But Smith Barney 's Mr. Doyle , who yesterday trimmed his 1990 Anheuser earnings projection to $ 2.95 a share from $ 3.10 , called the market 's reaction `` justified . ''
wsj_1014	24	While the third-quarter earnings were a `` moderate disappointment , '' he said , `` the real bad news is the intensity of price competition '' in the premium-beer sector .
wsj_1014	25	According to Mr. Steinman , the newsletter publisher , Anheuser 's market share is nearly twice that of its nearest competitor , Miller Brewing , which had a 21.2 % stake last year .
wsj_1014	26	It 's followed by Stroh Brewery Co. , which has agreed to sell its assets to Coors .
wsj_1014	27	Both Coors and Stroh have recently been ceding market share to Miller and Anheuser .

wsj_1015	6	On Wednesday , the market opened bullishly with high turnover , ignoring the volatility in New York stocks .
wsj_1015	7	But losers were spread in a broad range by the end of the session .
wsj_1015	8	A trader said that the more an issue gained recently , the sharper the loss sustained Wednesday .
wsj_1015	9	A trader at Yamaichi Securities said the market 's mood was undercut by the continuing fall of Nippon Telegraph & Telephone shares , which declined to their lowest level since the begining of this year .
wsj_1015	10	NTT lost 30,000 yen to 1,380,000 yen $ 9,756 .
wsj_1015	11	Some traders noted individual investors dumped NTT shares amid growing expectation for a division of the company as suggested by a recent government-sponsored panel .
wsj_1015	12	Dealers said they also took profits to reduce holdings in their own account at the end of the October transaction period .
wsj_1015	13	Among pharmaceutical shares , Chugai lost 60 yen to 2,290 yen $ 16.20 , and Mochida fell 150 to 4,290 .
wsj_1015	14	Other losing issues included Showa Shell , which fell 40 to 1,520 .
wsj_1015	15	Toyota Motor fell 40 to 2,680 .
wsj_1015	16	Sekisui House , which gained 150 Tuesday , lost 70 to 2640 .
wsj_1015	17	Daiwa House also ended easier , but Misawa Home was firmer .
wsj_1015	18	Pioneer Electronic and Sony , both of which dominated buying earlier this month , continued to fall Wednesday .
wsj_1015	19	Pioneer was down 90 at 5,810 , and Sony lost 40 to 8,550 , down 10 % from its record set Oct. 11 .
wsj_1015	20	London share prices closed modestly higher largely on technical factors , although the market was underpinned near the end of the session by Wall Street 's firmer trend .
wsj_1015	21	The Financial Times 100-share index finished at 2161.9 , up 12.6 points .
wsj_1015	22	The 30-share index ended 12.6 points higher at 1751.9 .
wsj_1015	23	Volume was thin at 374.6 million shares traded , down from 405.4 million Tuesday .
wsj_1015	24	Dealers said the market gained some late steam on a flurry of buying by market-makers looking at blue-chip issues and stocks viewed as oversold during the market 's recent downtrend .
wsj_1015	25	Outside what essentially amounted to a bookkeeping exercise , dealers said London dealings were largely dulled by the absence of active interest beyond the market-makers .
wsj_1015	26	The late buying was drawn into the London market , dealers added , after Wall Street showed signs of stability following its rocky opening .
wsj_1015	27	Stocks that suffered on the day were those with active U.S. operations , dealers noted .
wsj_1015	28	Among them were B.A.T Industries , which settled 6 pence a share lower at 753 $ 12.10 .
wsj_1015	29	Hanson , with 15 million shares traded , closed 2.5 lower at 212.5 .
wsj_1015	30	Dealers said the shares were hit by fears of a slowdown in the U.S. economy .
wsj_1015	31	Cable & Wireless benefited from a market squeeze , bouncing 13 to 498 in moderately active volume .
wsj_1015	32	Jaguar was boosted 21 to 715 on follow-through buying after Ford Motor 's announcement Tuesday that it might be prepared to mount a full bid for the U.K. luxury auto maker .
wsj_1015	33	It was further helped by Ford , which announced after London 's close that it had raised its stake to 12 % from just under 11 % on Tuesday .
wsj_1015	34	Frankfurt prices closed sharply lower in thin dealings , hurt by the roller-coaster session on Wall Street Tuesday and worries about wage demands by the largest West German trade union .
wsj_1015	35	The German stock index tumbled 26.29 to end at
wsj_1015	36	`` It was dead , listless , depressing and negative , '' said one trader at a U.S. bank in Frankfurt .
wsj_1015	37	`` There was little turnover and nothing to stimulate the market . ''
wsj_1015	38	Equities tumbled at the opening as Tuesday 's gyrations on Wall Street , where the Dow Jones Industrial Average recovered most of an 80-point loss , fueled fears of another stock market crash , brokers said .
wsj_1015	39	Tough talk from trade union officials at the conference of the powerful IG Metall metals worker union in West Berlin raised the specter of nationwide strikes next spring , they said .
wsj_1015	40	For the 1990 wage negotiations , the IG Metall is demanding a further cut in the German workweek and steep wage increases , which could sharply increase the costs for German industry .
wsj_1015	41	`` All the positive figures on the economy are out already , and people are focusing more on the dangers for next year , mostly the wage talks and the parliamentary elections , '' the U.S. trader said .
wsj_1015	42	The market also shrugged off positive factors , such as higher bond prices and a slowdown in monetary growth in September , traders said .
wsj_1015	43	They said they expect the bearish mood to persist a while longer , as trading volume is falling toward the end of the year and the market is becoming more volatile .
wsj_1015	44	In the auto sector , Bayerische Motoren Werke plunged 14.5 marks to 529 marks $ 288 , Daimler-Benz dropped 10.5 to 700 , and Volkswagen slumped 9 to 435.5 .
wsj_1015	45	Continental gave up some of its recent gains , dropping 8 to 338 , as rumors of an impending takeover attempt for the tiremaker faded , brokers said .
wsj_1015	46	Deutsche Bank plummeted 12 to 645 , hurt by the general mood .
wsj_1015	47	Other banks were slightly more resilient , with Dresdner Bank shedding 4.8 to 320 , and Commerzbank slipping 2.5 to
wsj_1015	48	Meanwhile , Wall Street 's volatility unnerved investors in other markets .
wsj_1015	49	Share prices closed lower in Paris , Zurich , Brussels , Milan and Stockholm , and mixed in Amsterdam .

wsj_1016	0	French chemicals group , Orkem S.A. , said Wednesday it has made a bid for control of Coates Brothers PLC , a British manufacturer of inks and polyester resins .
wsj_1016	1	State-controlled Orkem already owns 40.6 % of Coates .
wsj_1016	2	The remainder is held by the public and by family interests , a spokeswoman for the French group said .
wsj_1016	3	Orkem declined to give details of its offer , saying only that the bid will be submitted for approval by the board of the British company .
wsj_1018	0	Rupert Murdoch acquired a 25 % stake in Grupo Zeta S.A. , the leading Spanish magazine and newspaper publisher said .
wsj_1018	1	The transaction called for Mr. Murdoch 's News International PLC , a unit of Australia-based News Corp. , to subscribe to a rights issue by Zeta valued at 6.65 billion pesetas $ 57 million .
wsj_1018	2	Also participating in the issue was Servifilm Spain Cinematografica S.A .
wsj_1018	3	The film producer , owned by Madrid-based financier Jacques Hachuel , received a 5 % stake in the Barcelona-based publishing group .
wsj_1018	4	The cash injection boosted Zeta 's capital more than four-fold , to 8.47 billion pesetas from 1.82 billion pesetas , greatly enhancing the group 's ability to make investments , Zeta officials said .
wsj_1018	5	Following its failure last month to win a license for one of Spain 's first three private television stations , Zeta is seeking investment opportunities in communications and publishing .
wsj_1018	6	With annual sales of about 30 billion pesetas , Zeta publishes over a dozen magazines , including the popular Tiempo , Interviu and Panorama , and three regional dailies .
wsj_1018	7	Chairman Antonio Asensio will retain a 70 % share in Zeta .
wsj_1019	0	The New York Stock Exchange is expected to launch its own program trading vehicle today , just as controversy over this trading strategy heats up .
wsj_1019	1	The Big Board this morning plans to begin trading its Exchange Stock Portfolio `` basket '' product , the first program-trading vehicle carrying the exchange 's seal of approval .
wsj_1019	2	ESPs will allow institutional investors to buy or sell all 500 stocks in Standard & Poor 's index in a single trade of a minimum of $ 5 million .
wsj_1019	3	`` Customized '' baskets of fewer stocks will also be available .
wsj_1019	4	The Securities and Exchange Commission gave provisional six-month approval to the Big Board basket at a meeting late yesterday .
wsj_1019	5	The SEC at the same time approved a similar but smaller basket product on the Chicago Board Options Exchange , where the minimum will be $ 1.7 million .
wsj_1019	6	Also approved was a plan to trade stock portfolios by computer after regular hours on the Midwest Stock Exchange .
wsj_1019	7	The basket products are `` an evolutionary step '' in solving problems in trading big blocks of stock that came to light in the 1987 market crash , said SEC Commissioner Joseph Grundfest .
wsj_1019	8	New SEC Chairman Richard Breeden , overseeing his first public meeting , said there have been concerns that the Big Board 's basket could attract investors with a `` short-term perspective '' who would rapidly turn over the product , thus increasing volatility .
wsj_1019	9	But Richard Ketchum , the SEC 's market regulation chief , said he did n't believe `` this will spawn dramatic new program-trading strategies that will be destabilizing . ''
wsj_1019	10	The baskets on the Big Board and CBOE -- which involve the actual S&P stocks , unlike the stock-index contracts currently traded on the Chicago futures markets , and index options on the CBOE -- will begin trading as critics step up their attacks on program trading and its contributions to the stock market 's wild price swings .
wsj_1019	11	The Big Board argues that its new product will help rather than hurt the situation by possibly drawing business from more-volatile forms of program trading .
wsj_1019	12	ESPs are also an attempt by the Big Board to head off the exodus of program trading business to overseas markets such as London .
wsj_1019	13	Big Board officials also hope Japanese investors will become interested in the exchange 's product .
wsj_1019	14	Already , many of the Big Board 's own floor traders are warning that the ESP baskets are risky and not in the best interests of the investing public .
wsj_1019	15	The 400-member Alliance of Floor Brokers said the new product , with the $ 5 million minimum , will benefit only big institutional investors and could lead to `` wild spasms of volatility . ''
wsj_1019	16	Stockbrokers who cater to individual investors said the Big Board 's new product confirms the exchange does n't want to curtail program trading , which last month accounted for a record 13.8 % of the exchange 's average daily volume .
wsj_1019	17	`` The New York Stock Exchange is losing its cool here , '' said James Andrews , head of institutional trading at Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. in Philadelphia .
wsj_1019	18	The new stock baskets `` are going to make it easier for program trading to be done .
wsj_1019	19	And it 's going to be done more frequently as the result of having more access to it at different places . ''
wsj_1019	20	Both the Big Board 's Exchange Stock Portfolio and the Chicago exchange 's Market Basket are designed for institutional investors .
wsj_1019	21	The Big Board lists its targets as pension plans , mutual fund managers and index-arbitrage traders .
wsj_1019	22	In index arbitrage , program traders buy and sell stocks and stock-index futures to profit from small price discrepancies between the markets .
wsj_1019	23	At the same time , only four securities firms have signed up with the Big Board to buy and sell ESPs as market makers , an unenthusiastic response .
wsj_1019	24	The market makers so far are CS First Boston Group 's First Boston Corp. unit , Morgan Stanley & Co. , PaineWebber Group Inc. and Salomon Inc. 's Salomon Brothers Inc. unit .
wsj_1019	25	Kidder , Peabody & Co. , a General Electric Co. unit that has become the biggest program trader along with Morgan Stanley , is n't a market maker , although the Big Board hopes that will change .
wsj_1019	26	Similarly , the Big Board hopes to entice Merrill Lynch & Co .
wsj_1019	27	Neither has plans to be a market maker for now .
wsj_1019	28	Traders said major securities firms are reluctant to become market makers because they fear the baskets may attract only limited trading .
wsj_1019	29	Big Board officials say only 25 contracts a day may trade at first , equivalent to a day 's action at a small , regional exchange .
wsj_1019	30	Even though the Big Board says its product represents a post-crash `` reform , '' some traders suggest that if the new basket had been trading during this month 's Friday the 13th market plunge , the Dow Jones Industrial Average might have dropped more than the 190 points it did .
wsj_1019	31	With the futures locked into a trading halt Oct. 13 and trading in some individual stock difficult , program traders would have undoubtedly fled to the basket system , the traders say .
wsj_1019	32	`` If we had the baskets , we would be leaving in caskets , '' one trader said .
wsj_1019	33	The SEC 's Mr. Breeden said the after-hours trading on the Midwest exchange would help the U.S. win back business that has moved overseas to conduct after-hours trades .
wsj_1020	0	Comprehensive Care Corp. , which has agreed to be acquired by closely held First Hospital Corp. , reported a $ 4.7 million loss for its Aug. 31 first quarter and said it is negotiating an extension of senior bank debt past its Oct. 18 due date .
wsj_1020	1	In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange , Comprehensive Care shares plunged $ 3.625 to close at $ 4.75 on volume of 1,177,000 shares .
wsj_1020	2	The loss in Comprehensive Care 's latest quarter is equal to 46 cents a share .
wsj_1020	3	In the year-earlier quarter , Comprehensive Care earned $ 1.6 million , or 18 cents a share .
wsj_1020	4	Revenue in the latest quarter fell 17 % to $ 44 million from $ 53.2 million , the company said , reflecting poor utilization of the company 's facilities and its behavioral medicine contracts .
wsj_1020	5	Comprehensive Care shareholders have approved acquisition of the developer and operator of Care-Unit chemical dependency and psychiatric programs for about $ 58 million in cash , notes and stock of First Hospital , Norfolk , Va .
wsj_1020	6	The price was reduced last August from an indicated value of $ 76 million .
wsj_1020	7	Comprehensive Care said First Hospital had advised it that both bank debt and senior notes would be repaid after the acquisition , although it is n't assured the acquisition will be completed .
wsj_1020	8	If it is n't completed , Comprehensive Care said it would be `` required to promptly restructure its debt . ''
wsj_1020	9	First Hospital advised Comprehensive Care that an agent for the financial institutions providing financing of its acquisition is scheduled to make a final credit determination tomorrow , and that a favorable determination could result in a reorganization at Comprehensive Care `` by the end of October . ''
wsj_1020	10	Failure to win such a determination , however , would lead Comprehensive Care directors to `` consider various alternatives , '' Comprehensive Care said , without elaborating .
wsj_1020	11	Separately , First Hospital reported a 1.6 % rise in net income to $ 6.1 million for its year ended June 30 on a 27 % increase in revenue to $ 110.6 million .
wsj_1020	12	It said , however , that net income for the two-month period ended Aug. 31 plunged to $ 150,000 from $ 851,000 in the prior year on a 33 % rise in revenue to $ 21.4 million .
wsj_1021	0	A group including New York investors Douglas A. Kass and Anthony Pedone holds the equivalent of a 12.6 % stake in H.H. Robertson Co. 's common shares outstanding , according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission .
wsj_1021	1	Officials of Pittsburgh-based H.H. Robertson , which makes steel roofs , store fronts and building parts , declined comment .
wsj_1021	2	As reported last month , Mr. Kass said he was interested in making an offer to buy H.H. Robertson for $ 13 a share .
wsj_1021	3	In the SEC filing , the Kass-Pedone group said it intends to acquire additional H.H. Robertson shares `` with a view towards a possible change in control of the company . ''
wsj_1021	4	It has not , however , made a formal proposal .
wsj_1021	5	The group also is engaged in talks with third parties regarding obtaining financing to buy more shares , but no agreements have yet been reached , the filing said .
wsj_1021	6	The group controls 795,900 H.H. Robertson common shares , assuming exercise of an option it acquired from Executive Life Insurance Co. to buy 497,400 shares .
wsj_1021	7	Its stake includes 106,100 shares bought in the open market from Aug. 30 to Oct. 18 for $ 10.375 to $ 12.125 a share .
wsj_1021	8	In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , H.H. Robertson closed at $ 11.625 , up 62.5 cents .
wsj_1022	0	After coming close to a partial settlement a year ago , shareholders who filed civil suits against Ivan F. Boesky and the partnerships he once controlled again are approaching an accord , people familiar with the case said .
wsj_1022	1	Meanwhile , within the next few weeks , the limited partners in Ivan F. Boesky & Co . L.P. are expected to reach a partial settlement with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. regarding the distribution of the $ 330 million in partnership assets , said one of the individuals .
wsj_1022	2	Under the terms of the settlement , the limited partners would drop their civil suits against Drexel , now pending in federal court in New York , another individual said .
wsj_1022	3	Attorneys involved in the talks said that the parties were closer to accord than they were a year ago , when reports of an imminent agreement circulated .
wsj_1022	4	One individual said the shareholders ' accord was `` well worked out . ''
wsj_1022	5	However , less optimistic attorneys warned that because of the tangle of numerous defendants and plaintiffs with overlapping claims , there is always the possibility that the talks will again fall apart .
wsj_1022	6	A shareholders ' accord would provide the first restitution to thousands of individuals and institutions claiming losses as a result of insider trading by Boesky & Co. , once the largest arbitrage fund in the U.S. .
wsj_1022	7	The plaintiffs are investors who bought and sold securities in which Mr. Boesky and his partnerships were dealing .
wsj_1022	8	Some claim they suffered losses because they sold while he was buying and others because they bought while he was selling .
wsj_1022	9	Stocks involved in the shareholder suits include Union Carbide , RJR Nabisco , American Natural Resources , Boise Cascade Corp. , General Foods Corp. , Houston Natural Gas and FMC Corp .
wsj_1022	10	There are at least 27 class-action shareholder suits that have been consolidated in federal court in New York under U.S. District Judge Milton Pollack .
wsj_1022	11	Among the defendants are Mr. Boesky ; the now-defunct Ivan F. Boesky & Co. ; Mr. Boesky 's main underwriter , Drexel Burnham ; and Cambrian & General Securities PLC , a British investment fund once controlled by Mr. Boesky .
wsj_1022	12	Individuals familiar with the negotiations said the partial settlement being negotiated would remove the Boesky partnership , the British fund and Mr. Boesky as defendants , while Drexel and other defendants would remain .
wsj_1022	13	Charles Davidow , of the Washington , D.C.-based law firm Wilmer , Cutler & Pickering , which represents Mr. Boesky in this matter , said only that `` discussions are under way .
wsj_1022	14	There are no agreements yet . ''
wsj_1022	15	It has been three years since Mr. Boesky , now in prison , agreed to pay a $ 100 million fine to settle the government 's charges that he had traded illegally using insider information .
wsj_1022	16	Out of this , the government set up a $ 50 million fund for plaintiffs who can prove their financial losses .
wsj_1022	17	According to William Orbe , an attorney at Grais & Richards , the escrow agents for the fund , as of Sept. 30 the fund amounted to $ 60.5 million .
wsj_1022	18	Separately , attorneys for the 42 or so limited partners have had serious discussions that could lead to the distribution of the partnership 's assets .
wsj_1022	19	The limited partners include insurance companies , financial institutions and individual investors .
wsj_1022	20	An agreement with Drexel regarding the limited partners ' investments is an essential step toward getting their money back .
wsj_1022	21	This is because a Delaware court earlier this year said that Drexel is entitled to get its money back before or at the same time as the limited partners .
wsj_1022	22	Drexel is owed $ 20 million by the partnership .
wsj_1022	23	An individual familiar with the negotiations said that whatever investments the limited partners do not recoup from the $ 330 million in partnership assets , they will receive from the $ 350 million restitution fund available as a result of Drexel 's settlement with the government in December 1988 .
wsj_1022	24	Drexel agreed to plead guilty to six felony counts and pay $ 650 million , of which $ 350 million was set aside for shareholders and other plaintiffs , including the limited partners , who claim they were injured by Drexel .

wsj_1022	26	U.S. District Judge Robert P. Patterson Jr. ordered the FBI to immediately begin processing Herman Benjamin Ferguson 's request for documents stemming from the agency 's investigation of him during the 1960s .
wsj_1022	27	The FBI had said it would not be able to begin processing the request until June
wsj_1022	28	Mr. Ferguson , who is 68 years old , fled the U.S. in 1970 after exhausting his appeals of a 1968 conviction on conspiracy to murder .
wsj_1022	29	He turned himself in to authorities in New York earlier this year .
wsj_1022	30	He maintains that the information from the FBI will help him get his 1968 conviction vacated and his bail-jumping indictment dismissed .
wsj_1022	31	His attorneys claim he was framed by the FBI and New York police as part of a campaign to destroy the black liberation movement of the 1960s .
wsj_1022	32	Because the federal Freedom of Information Act was n't law at that time , the FBI was n't required to turn over information on its investigations when Mr. Ferguson appealed his conviction in the 1960s .
wsj_1022	33	But in federal court in Manhattan , Judge Patterson said the FBI records could show that Mr. Ferguson 's arrest was the result of questionable legal practices .
wsj_1022	34	The judge said that if the FBI 's proposed schedule was followed in releasing the documents , `` a delay of over one year will have occurred and plaintiff will have served approximately two-thirds of his 3 1/2-year minimum sentence by the time he receives the files . ''
wsj_1022	35	Gabriel W. Gorenstein , the assistant U.S. attorney handling the case for the FBI , said no decision has been made about appealing the judge 's ruling .
wsj_1022	36	FEDERAL COURTS URGED to cut costs and reduce delays of civil suits .
wsj_1022	37	The study , conducted by a task force of the Brookings Institution , suggests that Congress should require the courts to develop the plans .
wsj_1022	38	The study was initiated by Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Joseph Biden D. , Del . .
wsj_1022	39	The Washington , D.C. , think tank recommends that the courts adopt different `` tracks '' for different types of civil cases in order to separate the handling of highly complex suits from simpler ones .
wsj_1022	40	Complex cases , such as antitrust suits and many business disputes , would receive intense supervision by federal judges to keep pretrial proceedings moving .
wsj_1022	41	Standard cases would require less judicial attention , and fast-track cases could be resolved quickly .
wsj_1022	42	The study also said each federal court should set strict time limits for the pretrial exchange of documents and evidence , ranging from as much as 100 days for cases in the fast track to as much as 18 months for complex disputes .
wsj_1022	43	And the study said federal courts should set firm trial dates early in the process .
wsj_1022	44	To take advantage of local expertise and custom , the study said , Congress should require each of the 94 federal district courts to adopt its own plan to speed the handling of civil suits and to reduce the high costs in civil cases .
wsj_1022	45	Although some of the study 's recommendations resemble those of similar projects , the makeup of the task force was unusually diverse , adding significance to the effort .
wsj_1022	46	It included lawyers from civil rights and consumer groups , plaintiffs ' lawyers and defense attorneys , corporate counsel and law professors .

wsj_1028	0	American Medical International Inc. said it has n't received any other offers to acquire the owner and operator of hospitals , and took another step toward completion of its $ 3 billion acquisition by IMA Holdings Corp .
wsj_1028	1	Earlier this month IMA , an investment group that includes Chicago 's Pritzker family and First Boston Corp. , submitted a reduced bid for American Medical after it could n't finance its initial offer .

wsj_1028	10	The downgrade anticipates completion of the IMA Holdings acquisition today , Moody 's said .
wsj_1028	11	The ratings concern said the acquisition should result in pretax losses from operations because of increases in interest expense and charges for depreciation and amortization , but that it expects the losses to be reduced through productivity gains and above average growth of the company 's hospitals .
wsj_1028	12	Moody 's said the ratings anticipate a successful debt-reduction program and modest improvement in discretionary cash flow because of planned asset sales .
wsj_1028	13	Moody 's changes affected the following issues :

wsj_1033	3	A committee of outside directors for the Garden City , N.Y. , unit is evaluating the proposal ; the parent asked it to respond by Oct. 31 .
wsj_1033	4	The unit said it can provide no assurance a transaction will occur .

wsj_1033	6	The unit , which is the holding company for Esselte 's non-Swedish units , accounted for 58 % of sales and 71 % of operating profit last year .
wsj_1033	7	Separately , Esselte Business Systems reported third-quarter net income fell 5.9 % to $ 9.5 million , or 46 cents a share , from $ 10.1 million , or 49 cents a share , in the year-ago period .

wsj_1034	0	House and Senate conferees agreed to continue production of Grumman Corp. 's F-14 and to provide more than $ 3.8 billion for the Strategic Defense Initiative during the current fiscal year .
wsj_1034	1	Industry officials and congressional aides said that the main points of a compromise defense authorization bill , hammered out during a flurry of private meetings over the past few days , provide a face-saving compromise for both the White House and House Democrats .
wsj_1034	2	Although conferees are still putting the finishing touches on the package , the final agreement could be announced as early as tomorrow .
wsj_1034	3	An announcement is more likely next week , though .
wsj_1034	4	President Bush and other supporters of SDI will be able to take credit for blocking House efforts to significantly cut the program to develop a space-based antimissile system , which already has cost some $ 17 billion .
wsj_1034	5	Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn D. , Ga . and other Senate conferees have opposed the House cuts , stalling for almost two months action on a number of big-ticket items in the Pentagon 's budget .
wsj_1034	6	The Senate voted to authorize $ 4.5 billion for SDI spending in the current fiscal year , but the House , reflecting a dramatic erosion of support for the program , earmarked only $ 3.1 billion .
wsj_1034	7	Despite the widening gap between the two sides , conferees eventually followed the pattern set in previous years by opting to roughly split the difference .
wsj_1034	8	That would hold spending on the program at about the previous year 's level .
wsj_1034	9	The decision to keep the embattled F-14 's production line running for at least another year is an important victory for the House , and especially for Rep. Les Aspin D. , Wis . .
wsj_1034	10	As the head of the House conferees , Rep. Aspin has been under intense pressure from his colleagues to reject Senate provisions that would have abruptly cut further F-14 production .
wsj_1034	11	The package `` provides a temporary , golden parachute for Grumman , '' according to one congressional aide familiar with the closed-door bargaining .
wsj_1034	12	But as part of the overall agreement , Grumman and its outspoken supporters on Capitol Hill effectively will be precluded from reopening the emotional issue in the debate over next year 's budget .
wsj_1034	13	Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and most senators contend that the Navy 's F-14 is too expensive in an era of shrinking Pentagon budgets .
wsj_1034	14	But the plane boasts a strong core of support in the House , where members are intent on saving Grumman jobs and are worried about potential shortages of carrier-based aircraft by the late 1990s .
wsj_1034	15	Conferees also agreed to Pentagon requests to earmark a total of nearly $ 1 billion for work on both mobile MX and Midgetman nuclear missiles , according to congressional aides .
wsj_1034	16	And lawmakers are putting the finishing touches on a compromise that would give the Air Force nearly all of the $ 2.4 billion it wants for production of Northrop Corp. 's radar-eluding B-2 bombers , which cost $ 530 million apiece .
wsj_1034	17	The final B-2 agreement is certain to require detailed testing and verification of the bomber 's capabilities , but congressional aides said the accord wo n't include a House-passed provision that would have withheld production funds until Congress approves a cheaper , scaled-down version of the $ 70 billion fleet of 132 B-2s envisioned by the Pentagon .
wsj_1035	0	Consolidated Freightways Inc. reported a 77 % drop in third-quarter net income , citing expected losses in its Emery Worldwide shipping business .
wsj_1035	1	The Menlo Park , Calif. , company said net was $ 7.4 million , or 22 cents a share , down from $ 32.3 million , or 86 cents a share , a year ago .
wsj_1035	2	Revenue totaled $ 1.01 billion , a 43 % increase from $ 704.4 million , reflecting the company 's acquisition of Emery earlier this year .
wsj_1035	3	Profit also suffered because of `` intense '' discounting in its long-haul trucking business , the company said .
wsj_1035	4	Analysts had expected Consolidated to post a slim profit , and the company 's stock was down only 25 cents to $ 30.25 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday .
wsj_1035	5	`` They have to continue to tighten their belts , '' said Craig Kloner , an analyst at Goldman , Sachs & Co .
wsj_1038	0	Benjamin Franklin Federal Savings & Loan Association said it plans to restructure in the wake of a third-quarter loss of $ 7.7 million , or $ 1.01 a share , reflecting an $ 11 million addition to loan-loss reserves .
wsj_1038	1	The Portland , Ore. , thrift said the restructuring should help it meet new capital standards from the Financial Institution Reform , Recovery and Enforcement Act .
wsj_1038	2	A year ago , Benjamin Franklin had profit of $ 1.8 million , or 23 cents a share .
wsj_1038	3	In over-the-counter trading yesterday , Benjamin Franklin rose 25 cents to $ 4.25 .
wsj_1038	4	The company said the restructuring 's initial phase will feature a gradual reduction in assets and staff positions .
wsj_1038	5	The plan may include selling branches , consolidating or eliminating departments , and winding down or disposing of unprofitable units within 18 months .
wsj_1038	6	Initially , the company said it will close its commercial real-estate lending division , and stop originating new leases at its commercial lease subsidiary .
wsj_1038	7	Details of the restructuring wo n't be made final until regulators approve the regulations mandated by the new federal act , the company said .

wsj_1040	3	The move rewards shareholders and should improve the stock 's liquidity , Oneida said .

wsj_1040	5	In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , Oneida 's shares closed at $ 18.375 a share , unchanged .
wsj_1041	0	Federal health officials are expected today to approve a program granting long-deferred access to the drug AZT for children with acquired immune deficiency syndrome .
wsj_1041	1	Announcement of the approval is expected to be made by Louis Sullivan , secretary of Health and Human Services .
wsj_1041	2	The clearance by the Food and Drug Administration comes after two years of restricted access for the youngest victims of AIDS to the only antiviral drug yet cleared to treat the fatal disease .
wsj_1041	3	The drug will be given treatment investigational new drug status , a label accorded to drugs believed effective but lacking formal approval .
wsj_1041	4	The move will make the drug available free of charge for a time to children with the disease and symptoms of advanced infection .
wsj_1041	5	Adults with AIDS have had access to AZT since FDA approved the drug 's usage for adults in March 1987 .
wsj_1041	6	But despite more than two years of research showing AZT can relieve dementia and other symptoms in children , the drug still lacks federal approval for use in the youngest patients .
wsj_1041	7	As a result , many youngsters have been unable to obtain the drug and , for the few exceptions , insurance carriers wo n't cover its cost of $ 6,400 a year .
wsj_1041	8	So far , AIDS has stricken 1,859 children under age 13 , with many times that number believed to carry the infection without symptoms .
wsj_1041	9	To date , 1,013 of those children have died , according to the federal Centers for Disease Control .
wsj_1041	10	Mothers of young AIDS patients expressed somber satisfaction .
wsj_1041	11	`` Thank goodness it 's happening .
wsj_1041	12	It should have happened sooner , '' said Elizabeth Glaser , a Los Angeles mother and activist who contracted the AIDS virus through a blood transfusion , and transmitted it to two of her children .
wsj_1041	13	One of them , a daughter Ariel , died a year ago at age seven after her parents unsuccessfully pleaded for the drug .
wsj_1041	14	`` I could get AZT , '' says Mrs. Glaser , who bears her infection without any symptoms .
wsj_1041	15	`` But my daughter could n't , until she was too ill to take it .
wsj_1041	16	To watch your child die is an inhuman experience . ''
wsj_1041	17	Her son , healthy and symptom-free , currently takes no medication .
wsj_1041	18	The delay in getting AZT to children has been blamed on a combination of factors .
wsj_1041	19	Traditionally , the medical establishment has waited two years to approve adult treatments for pediatric uses , because of a combination of conservative safety standards and red tape .
wsj_1041	20	Secondly , critics have charged AZT 's maker Burroughs Wellcome Co. with corporate inertia because children account for just 1 % of the patient population and hence a small part of the large and lucrative market .
wsj_1041	21	Wellcome has replied that it is moving ahead to compile the relevant data , and recently promised to develop a pediatric syrup form easier for youngsters to take .
wsj_1041	22	Still , all this comes nearly a year and a half after Philip Pizzo of the National Cancer Institute offered evidence that AZT could reverse the ravages of AIDS dementia , sometimes prompting dramatic recovery of IQ levels and reappearance of lost motor skills .
wsj_1041	23	Since then , roughly 50 pediatric patients have received the drug in his program .
wsj_1041	24	To some mothers , the expected FDA action is a poignant reminder of what might have been .
wsj_1041	25	`` My first reaction is I do n't understand why it 's taken so long .
wsj_1041	26	Why has it taken people so long for people to understand pediatric AIDS is a major problem ? '' asked Helen Kushnick , whose son Samuel died six years ago at age three , victim of a tainted transfusion .
wsj_1041	27	Similar sentiments were voiced on Capitol Hill .
wsj_1041	28	`` While I 'm pleased the FDA is finally releasing AZT for children , it 's taken much too long to get to this point , '' said Rep. Ted Weiss .
wsj_1041	29	`` Why did it take Burroughs Wellcome so long to apply '' for treatment investigational new drug status ? the New York Democrat asked .
wsj_1041	30	`` Let 's not forget this is the same company that has been profiteering with this drug for 2 1/2 years , '' Mr. Weiss added .
wsj_1041	31	Mrs. Glaser , who is a co-founder of the Pediatric AIDS Foundation , based in Santa Monica , Calif. , condemned neither bureaucratic nor corporate foot-dragging .
wsj_1041	32	`` There 's no finger to be pointed , '' she said .
wsj_1041	33	`` The crucial thing is that we learn our lesson well , and to make sure other experimental drugs , like Bristol-Myers Co. 's DDI , do n't follow the same frustrating course as AZT . ''
wsj_1041	34	AIDS dementia -- which gradually steals children 's ability to speak , walk and think -- is often the most striking aspect of the pediatric syndrome .
wsj_1041	35	For some patients , AZT has restored the ability to ride a bicycle or solve puzzles , giving back a piece of their childhood if only temporarily .
wsj_1041	36	`` It 's impossible to overstate how much this means to the families of these patients , '' said Samuel Broder , director of the National Cancer Institute and a main developer of AZT .
wsj_1042	0	AVON RENT-A-CAR & TRUCK Corp. said it declared a dividend of one warrant for each three shares of common stock .

wsj_1045	2	But the brewer said Jeffrey Coors voluntarily gave up the position to focus more of his energy on Coors Technology Co. , a small unit of Coors he has run for several years .
wsj_1045	3	A Coors spokesman said the company does n't believe the move will further increase William Coors 's influence or reduce the influence of Jeffrey Coors , Peter Coors or Joseph Coors Jr. , who run the company 's three operating units .

wsj_1046	9	The only industry sector to report more business failures for the nine months was the finance , insurance and real-estate sector , where bankruptcies grew 8.1 % to 2,046 from 1,892 .
wsj_1046	10	The troubled savings-and-loan industry and subsequent stress in real-estate businesses fueled bankruptcies in this sector , D&B said .
wsj_1047	0	A major Tokyo newspaper reported that a Japanese department store concern is planning to offer about $ 1.3 billion to buy Bloomingdale 's .
wsj_1047	1	Campeau Corp. , the chain 's owner , declined to comment on the report .
wsj_1047	2	A spokeswoman said Toronto-based Campeau has received `` expressions of interest '' in Bloomingdale 's , but she declined to comment on whether any actual bids had been made .
wsj_1047	3	Nihon Keizai Shimbun , Japan 's leading economic newspaper , reported Wednesday that Tokyu Department Store Co. is planning to team up with U.S. and Western European financing to buy the New York-based retail chain , which Campeau has put up for sale .
wsj_1047	4	The service did n't identify its Tokyu sources .
wsj_1047	5	`` This is the first of many rumors we expect to hear during the sale 's process , '' said a Bloomingdale 's spokesman .
wsj_1047	6	`` We wo n't comment on them . ''
wsj_1047	7	Tokyu executives were n't available for comment early Thursday morning in Tokyo .
wsj_1047	8	Campeau 's chairman , Robert Campeau , said at its annual meeting in July that he valued Bloomingdale 's at $ 2 billion .
wsj_1047	9	Among previously disclosed possible bidders is Bloomingdale 's Chairman Marvin Traub , who has aligned himself with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and Blackstone Group .
wsj_1047	10	Investment bankers in Tokyo confirmed that Tokyu Department Store is one of several Japanese companies that has been approached by representatives of a management committee headed by Bloomingdale 's Mr. Traub .
wsj_1047	11	But they said detailed financial figures have n't been passed yet to any prospective buyers .
wsj_1047	12	`` Nobody is going to make a real bid before the middle of November , '' said one investment banker familiar with the discussions in Japan .
wsj_1047	13	`` Tokyu is one of the potential buyers who might raise its hand .
wsj_1047	14	But it 's in very early stages still . ''
wsj_1047	15	Bloomingdale 's is a 17-store chain acquired last year by Campeau in its $ 6.6 billion acquisition of Federated .
wsj_1047	16	Bloomingdale 's does an estimated $ 1.2 billion in annual sales .
wsj_1047	17	The sale of Bloomingdale 's is a condition of efforts by Toronto-based Olympia & York Developments Ltd. to arrange $ 800 million in bridge financing for Campeau , which disclosed last month that its retailing units , Federated Department Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp. , were strapped for cash .
wsj_1047	18	O&Y , owned by Toronto 's Reichmann family , is also supervising major restructuring and refinancing of Campeau , a Toronto-based real estate and retailing company .
wsj_1047	19	One executive familiar with the Bloomingdale 's situation said , `` No book has been issued regarding Bloomingdale 's , there are no projections , so I doubt very much whether any bid has been made . ''
wsj_1047	20	Separately , a Campeau shareholder filed suit , charging Campeau , Chairman Robert Campeau and other officers with violating securities law .
wsj_1047	21	The suit , filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan , seeks class-action status .
wsj_1047	22	The suit accuses the retailer and several of its officers of making false and misleading statements about the company 's business affairs .
wsj_1047	23	The suit says the company failed to disclose material adverse information about its financial condition .
wsj_1047	24	A spokesman for the company said Campeau has n't seen the suit and declined to comment .
wsj_1048	0	McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. must extend its offer for LIN Broadcasting Corp. because it has `` not yet announced committed financing sufficient to complete '' the bid , LIN said in New York .
wsj_1048	1	According to Securities and Exchange Commission rules , McCaw is required to keep its offer for the cellular-phone and broadcasting concern open for at least five business days after the announcement of the financing , LIN said .
wsj_1048	2	McCaw 's offer is scheduled to expire tomorrow .
wsj_1048	3	Last week , McCaw said it obtained `` firm '' financing commitments from three major banks in regard to its bid to control LIN Broadcasting .
wsj_1048	4	The banks jointly committed $ 1.2 billion of financing , subject to certain conditions , McCaw said .
wsj_1048	5	A spokesman for McCaw said the company was `` moving forward with our financing . ''
wsj_1048	6	He added that `` hopefully LIN will conduct a fair auction . ''
wsj_1048	7	McCaw wants to buy 22 million shares of LIN for $ 125 each , or $ 2.75 billion , which would result in McCaw 's owning 50.3 % of LIN .
wsj_1048	8	The offer is in limbo , however , because LIN has agreed to merge its cellular-phone businesses with BellSouth Corp .
wsj_1048	9	In national over-the-counter trading yesterday , LIN rose 50 cents , to $ 109.25 .
wsj_1049	0	NICHOLS INSTITUTE declared a 2-for-1 split of its common stock , payable Nov. 27 to stock of record Nov. 10 .

wsj_1050	0	StatesWest Airlines , Phoenix , Ariz. , ) said it sent a more detailed merger proposal to much-larger Mesa Airlines .
wsj_1050	1	Farmington , N.M.-based Mesa has consistently rejected StatesWest 's offers , and early this week said its board would n't give the proposal further consideration , calling it `` vague and ill-defined '' because it did n't describe the source of funds or the specific terms of StatesWest securities which were part of the offer .
wsj_1050	2	The new letter purports to do this , saying that in addition to $ 7 a share in cash , StatesWest would offer one share of new 6 % convertible preferred stock of StatesWest it values at $ 3 a share .
wsj_1050	3	It also said the cash portion of the transaction would be financed with StatesWest 's own cash and short-term investments , plus debt and other financing arranged through Hibbard Brown & Co. , the company 's investment banker .
wsj_1050	4	In national over-the-counter trading yesterday , Mesa closed at $ 7.25 , up 25 cents .
wsj_1050	5	StatesWest asked Mesa to repond by Oct. 31 .
wsj_1050	6	Mesa President Larry Risley said his board had received Stateswest 's most recent offer and was reviewing it .
wsj_1051	0	Spiegel Inc. , citing continuing improvement in the apparel market , said third-quarter net income jumped 65 % from the soft year-earlier period , on an 11 % increase in revenue .
wsj_1051	1	The catalog retailer reported net income of $ 10.8 million , or 21 cents a share , up sharply from $ 6.6 million , or 13 cents a share , a year earlier .
wsj_1051	2	Revenue rose to $ 372.1 million from $ 336.4 million .
wsj_1051	3	Spiegel said margins improved because its inventory position this year did n't need the costly markdowns required to trim last year 's swollen levels .
wsj_1051	4	A spokeswoman said the apparel market troughed in the first half of 1988 , then began showing improvement in the second half of last year .
wsj_1051	5	`` We 've seen continued improvement in 1989 , '' she said .
wsj_1051	6	The year-ago quarter 's results were crimped by expenses associated with Spiegel 's $ 260 million acquisition of catalog-clothing-merchandiser Eddie Bauer , Spiegel noted .
wsj_1051	7	In addition , the company said ongoing cost-cutting efforts contributed to the latest period 's earnings upturn .
wsj_1051	8	Spiegel is 84%-controlled by the Otto family of West Germany .
wsj_1051	9	In national over-the-counter trading , the company 's shares climbed 37.5 cents to $ 20.375 .
wsj_1051	10	For the latest nine months , Spiegel 's net climbed a solid 47 % to $ 23.8 million , or 46 cents a share , from $ 16.2 million , or 34 cents .
wsj_1051	11	Unlike the quarter 's results , which were based on roughly equal shares outstanding , nine-month per-share figures reflect an increase in average common shares outstanding to 51.9 million from 47 million .
wsj_1051	12	Nine-month revenue was $ 1.02 billion , up 22 % from $ 841.5 million .
wsj_1052	0	The bad news in the junk bond market yesterday was that TW Services , a group of restaurant chains , became the latest prospective issuer to get a cold shoulder from bond buyers .
wsj_1052	1	The good news -- to fans of stable credit , at least -- is what the rejection says about the state of mind of junk buyers .
wsj_1052	2	Apparently they are learning to say no to excess risk .
wsj_1052	3	Coniston Partners , which with related entities controls 80 % of TW , had been planning to sell $ 1.15 billion of junk bonds , among other things to finance their acquisition of the remaining public shares .
wsj_1052	4	But Coniston , a New York partnership managed by the firm of Gollust , Tierney & Oliver , yesterday announced that `` in view of unsettled conditions in securities markets '' the offering would be postponed and restructured .
wsj_1052	5	What was n't mentioned is that Coniston and its investment banker , Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette , just completed a two-week `` road show '' for the purpose of marketing the bonds .
wsj_1052	6	And investors , at least for now , took a pass .
wsj_1052	7	TW 's junk bonds were n't , as junk bonds go , unusually weak .
wsj_1052	8	Its fast-food restaurants -- including Denny 's , Hardee 's , Quincy 's and El Pollo Loco `` the only significant fast-food chain to specialize in char-broiled chicken '' ) -- are stable , recession-resistant and growing .
wsj_1052	9	But unless they continued to grow , TW , based in Paramus , N.J. , would have run into trouble .
wsj_1052	10	Until recently , such buy-now , pray-for-growth-later deals were routine .
wsj_1052	11	`` But people do n't buy anything on expectation anymore , '' says Jack Utter , who manages the high-yield fund of IDS Financial Services .
wsj_1052	12	`` Investors , '' he adds , `` are getting religion . ''
wsj_1052	13	The TW buy-out may yet be financed .
wsj_1052	14	`` There is nothing wrong with the company , '' says Coniston principal Paul Tierney .
wsj_1052	15	The rub , he says , is that `` the junk market is n't as deep '' as before .
wsj_1052	16	TW 's stockholder meeting was postponed from tomorrow to Nov. 21 .
wsj_1052	17	By then , DLJ hopes to be able to sell less-junky junk bonds .
wsj_1052	18	Gollust , Tierney & Oliver is likely to contribute more than the $ 120 million in equity it had planned on .
wsj_1052	19	Banks may contribute more senior debt .
wsj_1052	20	And the total amount of junk financing will be reduced .
wsj_1052	21	A DLJ banker , putting a best possible face on it , asserts that `` very few people said they did n't like the credit quality .
wsj_1052	22	People said they did n't think a billion-dollar deal would trade . ''
wsj_1052	23	But trading risk stems from credit risk .
wsj_1052	24	And by adding equity , DLJ would seem to be acknowledging that credit risk was a concern .
wsj_1052	25	Indeed , the DLJ banker says , in the reborn capital structure cash coverage of interest `` will meaningfully improve . ''
wsj_1052	26	As he sums it up : `` We are listening to the market . ''
wsj_1052	27	What is it , to borrow a term from Coniston , that so unsettled the market ?
wsj_1052	28	Some of the same risks that were cited -- and seemingly ignored -- in dozens of previous junk offerings .
wsj_1052	29	The TW prospectus says that if the acquisition had been completed earlier , pretax earnings `` would have been insufficient to cover its fixed charges , including interest on debt securities , '' by approximately $ 62.7 million in the first six months of 1989 .
wsj_1052	30	TW notes , as many junk issuers do , that `` adjusted to eliminate non-cash charges '' TW would have run a cash surplus -- in this case , of $ 56 million over six months .
wsj_1052	31	But such calculations ignore the noncash charge of depreciation , taken to allow for the gradual wearing out of french friers , deterioration of stores and the like .
wsj_1052	32	In fact , DLJ says , the company envisions capital expenses of about $ 180 million a year .
wsj_1052	33	TW 's pitch was that sales and earnings at its restaurants have risen steadily and that people wo n't stop eating during a downturn .
wsj_1052	34	But they wo n't necessarily eat at Denny 's .
wsj_1052	35	The fast-food business is `` intensely competitive , '' notes Wertheim Schroder analyst John Rohs .
wsj_1052	36	Prospective bond buyers noted that TW historically has prospered because it has been willing to spend aggressively on remodeling restaurants and redoing menus .
wsj_1052	37	`` We were concerned that they were n't going to generate enough cash for capital spending and also to pay down debt , '' says a big investor in high-yield debt .
wsj_1052	38	DLJ argues that TW could , if necessary , cut capital spending , since half of what it plans to spend is for `` growth , '' rather than maintenance .
wsj_1052	39	But investors noted that under the shelved offering , TW would have needed to grow to meet its debt payments .
wsj_1052	40	Its calculations for meeting cash charges ignore $ 52 million a year in interest on cash-deferred , or zero-coupon debentures -- which ultimately would have had to be paid .
wsj_1052	41	The prospectus notes `` there can be no assurance '' that future growth will continue at past levels .
wsj_1052	42	In the recent past , bond buyers did n't seek such assurance .
wsj_1052	43	Now , apparently , they do .

wsj_1053	0	Maggie Thatcher must be doing something right ; her political enemies are screaming louder than ever .
wsj_1053	1	Mrs. Thatcher , who was practicing the read-my-lips school of politics years before Mr. Bush encountered it , has made clear her opposition to refashioning Britain 's free-market policies to suit the bureaucrats in Brussels .
wsj_1053	2	In return , Mrs. Thatcher is excoriated from Fleet Street to Paris as an obstructionist .
wsj_1053	3	Well , it now turns out that Mrs. Thatcher had to travel across the globe to the 49-member Commonwealth summit in Kuala Lumpur to discomfit the Holy Order of Consensus Builders .
wsj_1053	4	`` A disastrous farce in Malaysia , '' screamed the Manchester Guardian .
wsj_1053	5	`` She can no longer be trusted to behave in a civilised -- that is unflaky -- fashion when abroad . ''
wsj_1053	6	Canada 's Brian Mulroney and Australia 's Bob Hawke , the paper said , were `` enraged . ''
wsj_1053	7	The London Times said she had `` contravened protocol . ''
wsj_1053	8	As usual , her sin was saying what she thought .
wsj_1053	9	She issued a separate statement , separating herself from a Commonwealth document reasserting the political value of imposing sanctions against South Africa .
wsj_1053	10	While supporting the Commonwealth `` in utterly condemning apartheid , '' her statement urged it to `` encourage change '' rather than inflict further punishment on the country 's black population .
wsj_1053	11	Actually there is a consensus somewhere on sanctions : In May a Gallup Poll found that most South African blacks , 85 % , oppose economic sanctions .
wsj_1053	12	Still , Mrs. Thatcher had once again gone against the grain .
wsj_1053	13	Malaysia 's Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad sniffed , `` If everybody else puts out their left foot and you put out your right foot , you are out of step . ''
wsj_1053	14	Mrs. Thatcher : `` If it 's one against 48 , I 'm very sorry for the 48 . ''
wsj_1053	15	If indeed Mrs. Thatcher has one opponent that could throw her off political course it is Britain 's mysteriously intractable inflation problem .
wsj_1053	16	We can not , however , join the political chorus that as one proclaims how offputting it is that Mrs. Thatcher refuses to get along by going along .
wsj_1053	17	It is refreshing to see at least one world figure who knows what she believes in and is not inclined to reflexively compromise those beliefs .
wsj_1053	18	Perhaps Mrs. Thatcher understands better than those distressed at her style that ultimately history and Britain 's voters will decide who is right about Europe , sanctioning South Africa or running Britain 's economy .

wsj_1064	0	American Telephone & Telegraph Co. unveiled new optical transmission systems for data , video and voice communications .
wsj_1064	1	Two products in what the telecommunications giant called a new generation of such equipment are available now , AT&T said , and three others will be introduced in 1990 and 1991 .
wsj_1064	2	The products are aimed at a market expected to total more than $ 1 billion a year in sales by 1995 , said Morgan Buchner Jr. , vice president of transmission systems for AT&T .
wsj_1064	3	The products already available are cross-connect systems , used instead of mazes of wiring to interconnect other telecommunications equipment .
wsj_1064	4	This cuts down greatly on labor , Mr. Buchner said .
wsj_1064	5	To be introduced later are a multiplexer , which will allow several signals to travel along a single optical line ; a light-wave system , which carries voice channels ; and a network controller , which directs data flow through cross-connect systems .
wsj_1064	6	AT&T said the products , unlike previous generations , will meet so-called Sonet compatability standards , which AT&T expects to be broadly adopted .
wsj_1064	7	Sonet , or synchronous optical network , products have more capacity than earlier models .
wsj_1064	8	`` These products are the heart of our transmission-product line , '' Mr. Buchner said .
wsj_1064	9	He declined to disclose specific prices , but said each product costs in the tens of thousands , or even hundreds of thousands , of dollars .
wsj_1064	10	AT&T said it expects to beat to the marketplace two rivals , Northern Telecom Ltd. of Canada and France 's Alcatel N.V. , which also have announced Sonet-based products .
wsj_1064	11	AT&T predicted strong growth in demand for such products .
wsj_1064	12	It noted that last July , Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp. of Japan selected AT&T to supply $ 154 million of such equipment over a four-year period starting next year .

wsj_1066	2	Delmed said Robert S. Ehrlich resigned as chairman , president and chief executive .
wsj_1066	3	Mr. Ehrlich will continue as a director and a consultant .

wsj_1066	5	Mr. Ehrlich was succeeded as chairman by Gerd Krick , a director of Fresenius , a West German pharmaceutical concern .
wsj_1066	6	Ben Lipps , president of Fresenius USA , was named president , chief executive and chief operating officer .
wsj_1066	7	None of the officials was available for comment .

wsj_1066	9	Fresenius owns about 42 % of Delmed 's fully diluted common stock .
wsj_1066	10	The two companies have been discussing a transaction under which Fresenius would buy Delmed stock for cash to bring its beneficial ownership to between 70 % and 80 % of Delmed 's fully diluted common stock .
wsj_1066	11	The transaction also would combine Fresenius USA and Delmed .
wsj_1066	12	Under the proposal , Delmed would issue about 123.5 million additional Delmed common shares to Fresenius at an average price of about 65 cents a share , though under no circumstances more than 75 cents a share .
wsj_1066	13	Yesterday , Delmed said it `` continues to explore the possibility of a combination with Fresenius USA . ''
wsj_1066	14	It added that it is apparent that any terms of a combination `` would be substantially less favorable than those previously announced . ''
wsj_1066	15	While the discussions between Delmed and National Medical Care have been discontinued , Delmed will continue to supply dialysis products through National Medical after their exclusive agreement ends in March 1990 , Delmed said .

wsj_1069	1	Revenue rose 23 % to $ 100 million from $ 81.6 million .
wsj_1069	2	Net product sales accounted for $ 76 million , up from $ 57.5 million a year earlier .
wsj_1069	3	Sales of the heart drug TPA were $ 43.6 million , better than last year 's depressed third period when the company sold just $ 29.1 million of the drug .
wsj_1069	4	But TPA sales fell below levels for this year 's first and second quarter sales of $ 48 million , cooling investors .
wsj_1069	5	Genentech stock fell 12.5 cents in trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange to $ 20.125 .
wsj_1069	6	In the nine months , net income slid 21 % to $ 28.4 million , or 33 cents a share , from $ 36 million , or 42 cents a share .
wsj_1069	7	Revenues climbed 18 % to $ 289 million from $ 245.3 million .
wsj_1069	8	`` We continue to be on target for ... increasing TPA sales 20 % to 25 % this year , '' said founder and Chief Executive Officer Robert Swanson .
wsj_1069	9	But some analysts remain sour on the company .
wsj_1069	10	`` TPA sales are down quarter to quarter .
wsj_1069	11	Expenses are flat and that 's a good sign .
wsj_1069	12	There 's contract revenue from limited research and development partnerships .

wsj_1069	14	Genentech faces competition in the cardiac-drug market from SmithKline Beecham PLC 's heart drug Eminase , expected to receive market approval shortly .
wsj_1069	15	And Genentech is n't likely to have any new products ready for market until at least 1992 , Ms. Gilbert added .
wsj_1069	16	`` The company 's stock is trading at 40 times next year 's numbers , and that 's too much , '' she said .

wsj_1070	0	THE AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY 'S 1988 costs of fund raising and administration were $ 72.4 million , or 23.2 % of its revenue .

wsj_1071	0	Ryder System Inc. posted a third-quarter net loss of $ 27.6 million , because of an expected $ 57 million after-tax charge and continued weakness in the company 's truck-rental business .
wsj_1071	1	The loss , which is 38 cents a share , is the transportation services concern 's first quarterly setback in more than a decade and compares with net income of $ 55.3 million , or 68 cents a share , in the year-ago period .
wsj_1071	2	The previous year 's third quarter included gains on the sale of aircraft by the company 's Aviation Leasing & Services Division .
wsj_1071	3	Revenue was flat at $ 1.3 billion .
wsj_1071	4	The latest quarter 's after-tax charge -- which is 75 cents a share -- was related to adjustments to reserves for workers ' compensation claims ; reductions in vehicle fleets , staff and facilities ; and writedowns of assets .

wsj_1078	4	The Italian auto maker confirmed that it was discussing technical cooperation with Saab , but declined to comment on rumors that it was planning to buy Saab 's car division .
wsj_1078	5	Fiat 's rejection of partnership with Saab means that the Swedish company , which announced last Friday that its pretax profit for the first eight months plummeted 49 % , will have to look for a partner among other car manufacturers as both Ford Motor Corp. and Fiat have turned down the offer .

wsj_1084	2	The agency noted , however , the estimate will likely be confirmed .
wsj_1084	3	The institute did n't estimate annual price growth in September , but a 0.2 % rise by the consumer price index would put growth at either 178.8 or 178.9 , up 3.3 % or 3.4 % from the year-earlier level of 173.1 .

wsj_1091	0	Quickview Systems Inc. said it filed a lawsuit against Apple Computer Inc. , claiming patent infringement in an element of Apple 's popular HyperCard software program .
wsj_1091	1	The suit , filed in Minneapolis federal court , claims that Apple violated a Quickview patent that allows computer users to display `` only portions of multiple fields on a computer screen with the ability to see the entire contents of any given field . ''
wsj_1091	2	The HyperCard program allows users to design applications for Macintosh computers without having to be hardcore programmers and is distributed with every Macintosh sold .
wsj_1091	3	It 's one of the most popular computer programs of all time , but analysts said the Quickview suit does n't appear to bode major difficulties for Apple .
wsj_1091	4	The technology at issue `` is not an underlying technology of HyperCard to my knowledge , '' said Danny Goodman , a San Francisco-area HyperCard program developer .

wsj_1092	0	This is in response to Atsushi Kageyama 's Manager 's Journal , `` Looking for the Real Thing in Sony '' editorial page , Oct. 2 .
wsj_1092	1	Though I agree with many of Mr. Kageyama 's comments , I believe he points the gun in the wrong direction : It is n't the Americans who must be criticized for not understanding the Japanese culture , but the Japanese who insist on forcing their culture on Americans .
wsj_1092	2	The Japanese want us to accept their culture , but they refuse to accept the American culture .
wsj_1092	3	Japanese managers ca n't expect Americans to behave as if they were Japanese ; instead , they must manage Americans as Americans .
wsj_1092	4	Americans are expected to conform to the Japanese culture when in Japan .
wsj_1092	5	What is wrong with expecting the Japanese to conform to American norms when they locate here ?
wsj_1092	6	Americans place native or native speakers in charge of subsidiaries overseas .
wsj_1092	7	European multinationals do likewise ; even in America , their affiliates are usually run by American managers .
wsj_1092	8	But the Japanese insist upon Japanese managers everywhere they set up shop .
wsj_1092	9	Do the Japanese feel so superior that they can not find capable American managers ?
wsj_1092	10	Paul A. Herbig Indiana University Bloomington , Ind .
wsj_1092	11	Mr. Kageyama suggests that Kotobuki Electronics Industries workers were having difficulty understanding their foreign bosses ' perspective .
wsj_1092	12	While Mr. Kageyama does an excellent job of explaining the differences , both cultural and philosophic , I question his perspective .
wsj_1092	13	Would he suggest that employees of an American company doing business in Japan conform to their new bosses ' culture and philosophy ?
wsj_1092	14	Thus the conclusion is that the burden rests with management to understand/adopt the culture and philosophy of the country in which they are operating .
wsj_1092	15	The workers can be motivated , and the company reach its full potential , only when management embraces the employees ' perspective .
wsj_1092	16	A. Lawton Langford President Municipal Code Corp . Tallahassee , Fla .
wsj_1092	17	I believe Mr. Kageyama left out one major aspect of Japanese culture that permeated his piece : the belief in the superiority of Japanese culture and behavior vs. others .
wsj_1092	18	A manager should not have to rebut the opinions of his employees about the style of his management .
wsj_1092	19	Instead , he should listen to see how that criticism can be used constructively to advance his objective of carrying out a set of tasks through the efforts of his subordinates .
wsj_1092	20	Japanese culture vs. American culture is irrelevant .
wsj_1092	21	The key is how a manager from one culture can motivate employees from another .
wsj_1092	22	For Mr. Kageyama to argue that American employees must passively accept a direct imposition of the Japanese way of doing things is outright cultural chauvinism of the first order .
wsj_1092	23	The Japanese are neglecting the opportunity to synthesize a new corporate culture based on a fusion of the best aspects of both national cultures .
wsj_1092	24	Mr. Kageyama is accurate to deny a specific anti-American bias .
wsj_1092	25	It is more difficult to deny a general bigotry in seeing things only the Japanese way .
wsj_1092	26	When the response to criticism is only a better explanation of policies without altering the reasons for the criticism , I am convinced that Mr. Kageyama has still failed to attack the root cause of the problem and is simply treating symptoms .

wsj_1102	0	The dollar finished lower yesterday , after tracking another rollercoaster session on Wall Street .
wsj_1102	1	Concern about the volatile U.S. stock market had faded in recent sessions , and traders appeared content to let the dollar languish in a narrow range until tomorrow , when the preliminary report on third-quarter U.S. gross national product is released .
wsj_1102	2	But seesaw gyrations in the Dow Jones Industrial Average yesterday put Wall Street back in the spotlight and inspired market participants to bid the U.S. unit lower .
wsj_1102	3	UAL 's decision to remain an independent company sent share prices tumbling .
wsj_1102	4	By midmorning , the DJIA had plunged 80 points and foreign-exchange dealers quickly drove the dollar down .
wsj_1102	5	When the DJIA modestly rebounded , the dollar bounced back in choppy dealings but ended the day below the levels of late Monday .
wsj_1102	6	Stock prices , meanwhile , posted significant gains in later trading and closed down by only 3.69 points on the day .
wsj_1102	7	Some dealers said that the market 's strong reaction to Wall Street reflects a general uneasiness about the dollar .
wsj_1102	8	They added that the DJIA 's swift drop proved an easy excuse for the market to drive the U.S. currency in the direction it was already headed .
wsj_1102	9	In late New York trading yesterday , the dollar was quoted at 1.8355 marks , down from 1.8470 marks Monday , and at 141.45 yen , down from 141.90 yen late Monday .

wsj_1102	12	Tom Trettien , a vice president with Banque Paribas in New York , sees a break in the dollar 's long-term upward trend , a trend that began in January 1988 .
wsj_1102	13	He argues that the dollar is now `` moving sideways , '' adding that `` the next leg could be the beginning of a longer term bearish phase . ''
wsj_1102	14	Analysts peg the dollar 's recent weakness to an underlying slowdown in the U.S. economy , highlighted by recent economic data , particularly a surprisingly sharp widening in the August U.S. trade gap .
wsj_1102	15	They also point out that narrowing interest-rate differentials between the U.S. and its major trading partners tend to make the U.S. currency less attractive to foreign investors .
wsj_1102	16	Despite several spurts of dollar trading , it was noted that mark-yen cross trade grabbed much of the market 's attention .
wsj_1102	17	Following the dive in U.S. stocks , the mark has strengthened more than its major counterparts .
wsj_1102	18	Traders attribute the mark 's surge to a robust West German economy and higher rate differentials .
wsj_1102	19	But , they add that the mark 's strength is in part a reflection of a shift away from U.S. assets by Japanese investors into West German investments .
wsj_1102	20	`` The question remains : how much can the West German market absorb ? '' says one senior dealer .
wsj_1102	21	Some dealers say that Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita 's reassurance that Japanese monetary policy wo n't be changed for the time being has given investors an added excuse to push the yen down even further against the mark .
wsj_1102	22	Despite the yen 's weakness with respect to the mark , Tokyo traders say they do n't expect the Bank of Japan to take any action to support the Japanese currency on that front .
wsj_1102	23	Meanwhile , sterling slumped on news that the United Kingdom posted a wider-than-expected trade deficit in September .
wsj_1102	24	The news also knocked the British unit to below 2.95 marks in London , but a bout of short-covering helped sterling recoup some of its earlier losses .

wsj_1103	0	Boston Co. , the upper-crust financial services concern that was rocked by a management scandal late last year , has had a sharp drop in profitability -- mainly because a high-risk bet on interest rates backfired .
wsj_1103	1	Boston Co. 's fall from grace is bad news for its parent , Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc. , which has relied heavily on the banking and money management unit 's contributions in recent years .
wsj_1103	2	In 1988 , for example , Boston Co. had an estimated pretax profit of at least $ 110 million , while Shearson managed net income of just $ 96 million .
wsj_1103	3	Shearson does n't break out the earnings of its subsidiaries .
wsj_1103	4	But people familiar with Boston Co. 's performance say the unit had profit of around $ 17 million for the third quarter , after barely breaking even for the first six months .
wsj_1103	5	Shearson , meanwhile , posted net income of $ 106 million for the first nine months of the year , down slightly from $ 110 million for the year-ago period .
wsj_1103	6	Moody 's Investors Service Inc. last week downgraded the long-term deposit rating of Boston Co. 's Boston Safe Deposit & Trust Co. subsidiary , to single-A-1 from double-A-3 , citing problems in the company 's `` aggressively managed securities portfolio . ''
wsj_1103	7	John Kriz , a Moody 's vice president , said Boston Safe Deposit 's performance has been hurt this year by a mismatch in the maturities of its assets and liabilities .
wsj_1103	8	The mismatch exposed the company to a high degree of interest-rate risk , and when rates moved unfavorably -- beginning late last year and continuing into this year -- `` it cost them , '' Mr. Kriz said .
wsj_1103	9	Mr. Kriz noted that Boston Safe Deposit `` has taken some actions to better control asset-liability management and improve controls in general , and we think these will serve to improve credit quality . ''
wsj_1103	10	As some securities mature and the proceeds are reinvested , the problems ought to ease , he said .

wsj_1103	12	Boston Co. officials declined to comment on Moody 's action or on the unit 's financial performance this year -- except to deny a published report that outside accountants had discovered evidence of significant accounting errors in the first three quarters ' results .
wsj_1103	13	An accounting controversy at the end of last year forced Boston Co. to admit it had overstated pretax profits by some $ 44 million .
wsj_1103	14	The resulting scandal led to the firing of James N. von Germeten as Boston Co. 's president and to the resignations of the company 's chief financial officer and treasurer .
wsj_1103	15	The executives were accused of improperly deferring expenses and booking revenue early , in an effort to dress up results -- and perhaps bolster performance-related bonuses .
wsj_1103	16	Mr. von Germeten , in turn , attributed the controversy to judgmental errors by accountants and accused Shearson of conducting a `` witch hunt . ''
wsj_1103	17	Mr. Kriz of Moody 's said the problems in the securities portfolio stem largely from positions taken last year .
wsj_1103	18	The company 's current management found itself `` locked into this , '' he said .
wsj_1104	0	Mexico exported an average of 1,296,800 barrels of crude oil a day at an average of $ 15.31 a barrel during 1989 's first eight months for a total of $ 4.82 billion , Petroleos Mexicanos S.A. said .
wsj_1104	1	The state petroleum monopoly said sales in the period gained 15 % , and $ 262.4 million more than originally projected at an average of $ 10 a barrel on an export platform of 1,250,000 barrels a day .
wsj_1106	0	Oil imports to Japan rose 12 % in September from year-earlier levels , according to statistics released by the government 's Ministry of International Trade and Industry .
wsj_1106	1	The imports , totaling 98.5 million barrels , were 11 % lower than August levels .
wsj_1106	2	The year-on-year rise was partly because of higher demand for petroleum products , and partly because of tax changes in 1988 that left oil companies with high inventories in the late-summer/early-FALL PERIOD .
wsj_1106	3	Imports of crude from the Middle East grew 17 % from year-earlier levels , and Southeast Asian crude imports grew 43 % .
wsj_1106	4	While Mideast crude imports were higher compared with year-earlier levels , they fell 18 % compared with August imports .
wsj_1106	5	Southeast Asian crude imports , however , were 3.6 % higher than August .
wsj_1107	0	This is in response to George Melloan 's Business World column `` The Housing Market Is a Bigger Mess Than You Think '' op-ed page , Sept. 26 .
wsj_1107	1	In Houston , we have seen how bad the housing problem can become .
wsj_1107	2	Unused houses deteriorate rapidly , affecting the value of nearby homes ; in a domino effect , the entire neighborhood can fall victim .
wsj_1107	3	At this stage some people just `` walk away '' from homes where the mortgage exceeds current market value .
wsj_1107	4	But most of them could have afforded to keep up their payments -- they chose not to do so .
wsj_1107	5	The problem is so vast that we need to try innovative solutions -- in small-scale experiments .
wsj_1107	6	Here are some ideas :
wsj_1107	7	1 Foreclosed homes could be sold by the FHA for no down payment the biggest obstacle to young buyers , but with personal liability for the mortgage no walking away by choice .
wsj_1107	8	2 Encourage long-term occupancy by forgiving one month 's payment off the tail end of the mortgage for every six months paid ; or perhaps have the down payment deferred to the end of the mortgage balloon , but `` forgiven '' on a monthly pro-rata basis as long as the owner remains the occupant .
wsj_1107	9	3 Develop rental agreements with exclusive purchase options for the renter .
wsj_1107	10	An occupant will , in most every case , be better for the home and neighborhood than a vacant house .
wsj_1107	11	In this way , the house is not dumped on to a glutted market .
wsj_1107	12	The Federal Housing Administration , Veterans Administration and the Department of Housing and Urban Development further aggravate the problem of affordable housing stock by `` buying in '' to their foreclosed properties of which there are , alas , many at an inflated `` balance due '' -- say $ 80,000 on a house worth $ 55,000 -- instead of allowing a free market to price the house for what it 's really worth .
wsj_1107	13	Worse , the properties then sit around deteriorating for maybe a year or so , but are resold eventually because of the attractiveness of the low down payment , etc . to a marginal buyer who ca n't afford both the mortgage and needed repairs ; and having little vested interest that buyer will walk away and the vicious cycle repeats itself all over again .
wsj_1108	0	Italy 's unemployment rate rose to 12 % of the labor force in July from 11.9 % in April , and was up from 11.7 % a year earlier , according to quarterly figures from the state statistical institute .
wsj_1108	1	Istat said a national survey during the first week of July showed the number of job seekers was 2,888,000 up from 2,822,000 in April , and from 2,853,000 a year ago .
wsj_1108	2	The unemployment rate was by far the highest in the southern , so-called Mezzogiorno region .
wsj_1108	3	The southern unemployment rate rose to 21.3 % in July from 21.2 % in April and from 20.6 % a year earlier .
wsj_1108	4	Istat said 369,000 more people were employed in July than in April .
wsj_1109	0	Xerox Corp. 's third-quarter net income grew 6.2 % on 7.3 % higher revenue , earning mixed reviews from Wall Street analysts .
wsj_1109	1	Quarter net for the business-machines and financial-services company rose to $ 155 million , or $ 1.41 a share , from $ 146 million , or $ 1.37 a share , in the year-earlier period .
wsj_1109	2	Revenue rose to $ 4.45 billion from $ 4.15 billion .
wsj_1109	3	In New York Stock Exchange composite trading , Xerox closed at $ 62.75 a share , up $ 1 .
wsj_1109	4	Sales growth and profit in business products and systems -- Xerox 's main business -- were `` disappointing , '' said B. Alex Henderson , who follows the company for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc .
wsj_1109	5	Sales of Xerox copiers and other office products grew 1.6 % ; `` we expected growth of 6 % to 7 % , '' Mr. Henderson said .
wsj_1109	6	Operating-profit margins slipped almost 18 % , to 4.3 % of sales , the analyst noted .
wsj_1109	7	Still , with competitors such as Eastman Kodak Co. faltering in copier sales , Xerox 's sales increases `` were encouraging , '' says Eugene Glazer of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc .
wsj_1109	8	`` They are holding their own in a weak market , and the restructuring is working , '' he says .
wsj_1109	9	David T. Kearns , Xerox chairman and chief executive officer , cited the restructuring and `` strong '' cost controls for the 13 % growth in profit from business products and systems operations .
wsj_1109	10	Mr. Glazer expects Xerox to experience tough sledding , though , in financial services because of rate pressures and uncertainty surrounding tax treatment of capital gains .
wsj_1109	11	In the quarter , the Crum & Forster insurance unit reported $ 200 million before tax of capital gains from property and casualty operations .
wsj_1109	12	The subsidiary also increased reserves by $ 140 million , however , and set aside an additional $ 25 million for claims connected with Hurricane Hugo .
wsj_1109	13	For the nine months , Xerox earned $ 492 million , or $ 4.55 a share , up 5.8 % from $ 465 million , or $ 4.32 a share .
wsj_1109	14	Revenue rose 7.6 % to $ 12.97 billion from $ 12.05 billion .
wsj_1110	0	New orders for durable goods fell back slightly in September after shooting up the month before , reflecting weakening auto demand after a spurt of orders for new 1990 models , the Commerce Department reported .
wsj_1110	1	Orders for military equipment , household appliances , machinery and other goods expected to last at least three years dipped 0.1 % last month , to $ 126.68 billion , after leaping 3.9 % in August , the department said .
wsj_1110	2	Most analysts had expected a sharper decline after the steep rise in August .
wsj_1110	3	Moreover , a recent government report showing widespread layoffs in manufacturing had contributed to perceptions that the manufacturing sector of the economy had slowed to a crawl .
wsj_1110	4	But many economists pointed to a 1.8 % September rise in orders outside the volatile transportation category .
wsj_1110	5	That `` suggests the manufacturing sector is not falling apart , '' said Sally Kleinman , an economist at Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp. in New York .
wsj_1110	6	She added , however : `` It is not robust by any means . ''
wsj_1110	7	While a decline in orders for cars and civilian airplanes pulled down the orders total , an enormous jump in orders for heavy military equipment propped it up .
wsj_1110	8	Orders for capital defense goods skyrocketed 56 % , and a government analyst said nearly all areas saw increases , including airplanes , missiles , ships , tanks and communications equipment .
wsj_1110	9	Orders for military goods usually catapult in September , government officials say , as the Pentagon scrambles to spend its money before the new fiscal year begins Oct. 1 .
wsj_1110	10	While all the numbers in the durable goods report were adjusted for seasonal fluctuations , a Commerce Department analyst said that the adjustment probably did n't factor out all of the wide-ranging surge in defense orders .
wsj_1110	11	Without the increase in defense bookings , September orders would have plummeted 3.9 % .
wsj_1110	12	Analysts were most unsettled by evidence the backlog of orders at factories is slipping .
wsj_1110	13	Unfilled orders for durable goods rose 0.4 % in September , to $ 476.14 billion , after declining for the first time in 2 1/2 years in August .
wsj_1110	14	In July unfilled orders grew 1 % .
wsj_1110	15	But analysts noted that excluding transportation - where what they believe was a temporary surge in auto demand pushed up the figures - order backlogs have declined for three months in a row .
wsj_1110	16	`` It means we 're eating into the bread that keeps us going .
wsj_1110	17	That is a little disturbing , '' Ms. Kleinman said .
wsj_1110	18	`` It also means if you have a real drop-off in orders , production will likely fall off very quickly because there is less to keep things going . ''
wsj_1110	19	Capital goods orders outside of the defense sector tumbled for the second month in a row , posting a 5.6 % drop after a 10.3 % decline .
wsj_1110	20	Such steep drops in a category seen as a barometer of business investment would customarily be grave news for the economy .
wsj_1110	21	But a Commerce Department analyst said that in both months orders would have risen had it not been for a drop in civilian aircraft bookings , a category that is showing declines only after a huge surge earlier this year .
wsj_1110	22	Still , Milton Hudson , senior economic adviser at Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. in New York , said : `` If you look back a half-year or so the evidence was pretty good of affirmative strength in the capital-goods sector .
wsj_1110	23	Now at least there are question marks about that , and without any question the pace of growth has slowed .

wsj_1116	0	Your Oct. 2 editorial `` Reding , Wrighting & Erithmatic '' on the recent `` education summit '' was like most pieces on the subject of education : It had little to say .
wsj_1116	1	Oddly , though , on the very same page you printed a comment that addresses one of the most serious shortcomings of the American education system .
wsj_1116	2	Unfortunately , the comment was buried in another article , so it could not stand out in an education context .
wsj_1116	3	In the Manager 's Journal , Atsushi Kageyama , in commenting on many differences between American and Japanese culture , said , `` Japanese children are raised in a way many Americans would find severe .
wsj_1116	4	After a wonderfully frivolous early childhood , they are exposed to rigid discipline as soon as they enter school . ''
wsj_1116	5	What far too many people concerned about education either fail to understand or choose to ignore is that American children , on the whole , are among the most undisciplined in the world , making any attempt at improvements in the mode of education potentially unsuccessful .
wsj_1116	6	Unless parents and educators alike start to develop more discipline in children , all the worthy concern , discussions and actions will not solve the problem .

wsj_1122	2	Just after Hurricane Hugo battered South Carolina , some officials talked of perhaps adding a penny to the state gasoline tax or raising property taxes .
wsj_1122	3	Gov. Campbell responded , `` They 're mentioning rope when there 's been a hanging in the family . ''
wsj_1122	4	A spokesman says the governor believes he can avoid increases by relying on federal aid and shifting funds in state programs .
wsj_1122	5	Still , Hugo 's impact may revive unsuccessful proposals to give local governments authority to levy sales taxes .

wsj_1122	12	THE IRS WILL PAY if its error burdens you with bank charges .
wsj_1122	13	Policy statement P-5-39 sets out terms .
wsj_1122	14	As a result of an erroneous IRS levy on a bank account , a taxpayer may incur administrative and overdraft charges .
wsj_1122	15	If the IRS admits its error and the charges have been paid , it will reimburse a taxpayer who has n't refused to give timely answers to IRS inquiries or has n't contributed to continuing or compounding the error .
wsj_1122	16	The IRS recently amended the policy to cover stop-payment charges for checks lost by the IRS .
wsj_1122	17	If the IRS asks for and gets a replacement for a check that it concedes it lost in processing , it will reimburse the taxpayer for the stop-payment charge on the original .
wsj_1122	18	Reimbursement claims must be filed with the IRS district or service-center director within a year after the expense accrues .
wsj_1122	19	If the IRS seeks late-payment interest because of the lost check , you should request interest abatement , publisher Prentice Hall notes .
wsj_1122	20	JUST FIVE ACRES MORE are all we need to feel really at home , they say .
wsj_1122	21	A couple we 'll call the Blandings spent nearly $ 800,000 on a 15-acre plot and main home and have an old $ 175,000 mortgage exempt from the new limit on mortgage-interest deductions .
wsj_1122	22	They plan to expand the home site by buying five adjoining acres for $ 200,000 , borrowed against a first mortgage on the five acres and also collateralized by the 15 acres .
wsj_1122	23	Their debt will be well under the $ 1 million limit -- on borrowing to acquire , build , or improve a home -- that qualifies for mortgage-interest deductions .
wsj_1122	24	As you can guess , the Blandings want to deduct home-mortgage interest on the $ 200,000 loan .
wsj_1122	25	But , IRS private ruling 8940061 notes , no rule or court case bears directly on the issue of adding land to a principal residence .
wsj_1122	26	So the IRS has drawn a rationale from the sale of a home site split in two and sold in different years to the same buyer ; a court let the seller in that old case treat this as the sale of one residence .
wsj_1122	27	Thus , the IRS says , the Blandings ' $ 200,000 loan is home-acquisition debt , and interest on it is fully deductible .

wsj_1122	34	WHY BE A MIDDLEMAN for charitable gifts ? a retiree asks .

wsj_1122	36	So he has arranged for a university foundation to set up a scholarship fund for undergraduate engineering students .
wsj_1122	37	He plans to tell clients to pay certain fees directly to the foundation instead of to him ; he would omit those fees from income reported on his return .
wsj_1122	38	So he asked the IRS if the plan would work .
wsj_1122	39	Well , notes IRS private ruling 8934014 , `` a fundamental principle '' is that income must be taxed to whoever earns it .
wsj_1122	40	The rule goes back at least as far as a 1930 Supreme Court decision , Robert Willens of Shearson Lehman Hutton says .
wsj_1122	41	If you assign your income to another , you still have controlled its disposition and enjoyed the fruits of your labor , even if indirectly .
wsj_1122	42	Ben earns any fees sent directly to charity and is taxable on them , the IRS says ; of course , he also may take a charitable deduction for them .

wsj_1133	2	He has argued that such presidential power is necessary to rein in congressional spending .
wsj_1133	3	But some analysts , particularly conservative legal scholars , have urged Mr. Bush not to wait for explicit authorization but simply to assert that the Constitution already implicitly gives him the power to exercise a line-item veto .
wsj_1133	4	Such an assertion most likely would bring about a court challenge from Congress that would clarify whether a president already has such power .
wsj_1133	5	White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater , confirming comments made this week by Vice President Dan Quayle , said Mr. Bush is `` interested '' in finding a suitable test case .
wsj_1133	6	But he also said that exercising a test line-item veto is n't a `` top initiative '' on the president 's agenda because he faces more-pressing budget issues at the moment .
wsj_1134	0	Harris Ravine , executive vice president of customer satisfaction , was named executive vice president , finance and administration of this maker of data storage equipment .
wsj_1134	1	Mr. Ravine succeeds William R. Mansfield Jr. , who will remain with the company until the end of the year to support the transition and to complete important projects .
wsj_1135	0	The Bush administration said it is submitting a `` comprehensive '' proposal for overhauling agricultural trade that could help break an impasse in the current round of multilateral trade negotiations .
wsj_1135	1	The proposal reiterates the U.S. desire to scrap or reduce a host of trade-distorting subsidies on farm products .
wsj_1135	2	But it would allow considerable flexibility in determining how and when these goals would be achieved .
wsj_1135	3	The U.S. plan also would ease the transition to freer agriculture trade by allowing some countries to convert non-tariff barriers into tariffs that , together with existing tariffs , then would be phased out over 10 years .
wsj_1135	4	Trade Representative Carla Hills , who along with Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter unveiled the proposal , said she is confident it will gain considerable support from the U.S. 's trading partners .
wsj_1135	5	Mr. Yeutter , seeking to allay European objections to an earlier U.S. plan that called for eliminating all farm-trade barriers by the year 2000 , said the new U.S. proposal would n't `` put farmers out of business '' but would only encourage them to `` grow what the markets desire instead of what the government wants . ''
wsj_1135	6	The U.S. is submitting the proposal today in Geneva , hoping that the initiative will spur members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to reach agreement on new trade rules before their current negotiating round concludes in December 1990 .
wsj_1135	7	Another U.S. proposal filed Monday urges more `` fair play '' in services trade , including predictable and clear rules and equality in the treatment of foreign and domestic service companies .
wsj_1135	8	Unlike the earlier U.S. farm-trade proposal which struck European countries as too extreme , the latest plan would provide some room for maneuver .
wsj_1135	9	For instance , the new U.S. package makes clear there would be a transition period during which GATT members could use a combination of tariffs and quotas to cushion their farmers from foreign competition .
wsj_1135	10	It also says countries could temporarily raise tariffs on certain products if they experience an unusually heavy volume of imports .
wsj_1135	11	Instead of proposing a complete elimination of farm subsidies , as the earlier U.S. proposal did , the new package calls for the elimination of only the most tradedistorting ones .
wsj_1135	12	Less objectionable ones would be subject only to some restraints , and others with a `` relatively minor trade impact '' would be allowed to continue under certain conditions .
wsj_1135	13	The new U.S. plan also would establish procedures to prevent countries from using health and sanitation rules to impede trade arbitrarily .
wsj_1135	14	The goal would be to resolve disputes such as one prompted by the European Community 's current attempt to bar imports of beef from hormone-treated U.S. cattle .
wsj_1135	15	The U.S. contends that the rules are n't justified on health grounds .
wsj_1135	16	To encourage more competition among exporting countries , the U.S. is proposing that export subsidies , including tax incentives for exporters , be phased out in five years .
wsj_1138	0	The Justice Department has distributed these new guidelines for U.S. Attorneys prosecuting RICO cases .
wsj_1138	1	A related editorial appears today .
wsj_1138	2	Under RICO , the government may seek a temporary restraining order TRO upon the filing of a RICO indictment , in order to preserve all forfeitable assets until the trial is completed and judgment entered .
wsj_1138	3	Such orders can have a wide-ranging impact on third parties who do business with the defendants , including clients , vendors , banks , investors , creditors , dependents , and others .
wsj_1138	4	Some highly publicized cases involving RICO TROs have been the subject of considerable criticism in the press , because of a perception that pre-trial freezing of assets is tantamount to a seizure of property without due process .
wsj_1138	5	In order to ensure that the rights of all interested parties are protected , the Criminal Division has instituted the following requirements to control the use of TROs in RICO prosecutions .
wsj_1138	6	It should be noted that these requirements are in addition to any other existing requirements , such as review by the Asset Forfeiture Office . :
wsj_1138	7	1 . As part of the approval process for RICO prosecutions , the prosecutor must submit any proposed forfeiture TRO for review by the Organized Crime and Racketeering Section .
wsj_1138	8	The prosecutor must show that less-intrusive remedies such as bonds are not likely to preserve the assets for forfeiture in the event of a conviction .
wsj_1138	9	2 . In seeking approval of a TRO , the prosecutor must articulate any anticipated impact that forfeiture and the TRO would have on innocent third parties , balanced against the government 's need to preserve the assets .
wsj_1138	10	3 . In deciding whether forfeiture and , hence , a TRO is appropriate , the Section will consider the nature and severity of the offense ; the government 's policy is not to seek the fullest forfeiture permissible under the law where that forfeiture would be disproportionate to the defendant 's crime .
wsj_1138	11	4 . When a RICO TRO is being sought , the prosecutor is required , at the earliest appropriate time , to state publicly that the government 's request for a TRO , and eventual forfeiture , is made in full recognition of the rights of third parties -- that is , in requesting the TRO , the government will not seek to disrupt the normal , legitimate business activities of the defendant ; will not seek through use of the relation-back doctrine to take from third parties assets legitimately transferred to them ; will not seek to vitiate legitimate business transactions occurring between the defendant and third parties ; and will , in all other respects , assist the court in ensuring that the rights of third parties are protected , through proceeding under RICO and otherwise .
wsj_1138	12	The Division expects that the prosecutor will announce these principles either at the time the indictment is returned or , at the latest , at the first proceeding before the court concerning the TRO .
wsj_1139	0	Sales of North American-built cars and trucks plunged 20.5 % in mid-October from a year earlier , as domestic manufacturers paid the price for heavy incentives earlier this year .
wsj_1139	1	`` People are waiting for new factory giveaways , '' said Ben Kaye , sales manager of Bob Brest Auto World in Lynn , Mass. , whose sales are slow .
wsj_1139	2	This trend appears to be especially true at General Motors Corp. , which used both dealer and consumer incentives to ignite sales in August and September .
wsj_1139	3	Since then , deliveries have slumped .
wsj_1139	4	GM 's car sales dropped 24.8 % in mid-October to 69,980 , while truck sales fell 26 % to 37,860 .
wsj_1139	5	GM also had dismal results in the first 10 days of the month , while other auto makers reported mixed results .
wsj_1139	6	All of the Big Three suffered in the just-ended period , however , with sales of all domestically made cars , including those built at Japanese-managed plants , falling 19 % to 158,863 from a year earlier .
wsj_1139	7	The seasonal adjusted annual selling rate was six million vehicles , a small improvement from the 5.8 million rate of early October , but a big drop from the 7.1 million rate a year ago .
wsj_1139	8	Sales of domestically made trucks also continued to be sluggish in mid-October , dropping 22.8 % to 94,543 from a year ago .
wsj_1139	9	The Big Three auto makers already have slashed fourth-quarter production plans 10.4 % below year-ago levels , but that may not be enough to prevent inventories from ballooning if sales do n't improve .
wsj_1139	10	Industry analyst John H. Qualls , a vice president with Hill & Knowlton in St. Louis , forecasts that domestic auto makers will have a 93-day supply of cars at the end of the year , even if car sales improve to a 6.5 million vehicle rate for the quarter .
wsj_1139	11	Ford Motor Co. reported a 21.2 % drop in sales of domestic-made cars to 46,995 and a 24.2 % drop in domestic trucks to 31,143 .
wsj_1139	12	The sales are being dragged down by a glut of 1989 vehicles , said Joel Pitcoff , a Ford analyst .
wsj_1139	13	The earlier use of incentives depleted the market of `` scavengers '' for bargain-basement 1989 cars , he said .
wsj_1139	14	Town & Country Ford in Charlotte , N.C. , still needs to move about 850 1989 cars and trucks .
wsj_1139	15	Business had been fairly strong until Hurricane Hugo hit the area , but has been down since .
wsj_1139	16	Chrysler Corp. also hit the rocks in mid-October .
wsj_1139	17	The No. 3 U.S. auto maker had a 23.7 % plunge in car sales to 22,336 and a 17.5 % drop in truck sales to 22,925 , which include its minivans and Jeeps .
wsj_1139	18	Honda Motor Co. , which continues to have short supplies of domestically made Accords , saw its sales of North American-built cars fall 14.1 % to 8,355 .
wsj_1139	19	But sales of domestic cars and trucks at Nissan Motor Corp. rose 26.1 % to 5,651 .
wsj_1139	20	A Nissan spokesman attributed the increase to the use of incentives this year and not a year ago and to higher fleet sales .
wsj_1139	21	Toyota Motor Corp. , which opened a plant in Georgetown , Ky. , last year , saw sales triple to 6,256 vehicles .
wsj_1139	22	a - Totals include only vehicle sales reported in the period .
wsj_1139	23	d - Percent change greater than 999 % .
wsj_1139	24	x - There were 9 selling days in the most recent period and 9 a year earlier .
wsj_1139	25	Percentage differences based on daily sales rate rather than sales volume .
wsj_1140	0	Short interest in Nasdaq over-the-counter stocks rose 6 % as of mid-October , its biggest jump since 6.3 % last April .
wsj_1140	1	The most recent OTC short interest statistics were compiled Oct. 13 , the day the Nasdaq composite index slid 3 % and the New York Stock Exchange tumbled 7 % .
wsj_1140	2	The coincidence might lead to the conclusion that short-sellers bet heavily on that day that OTC stocks would decline further .
wsj_1140	3	As it happens , the Nasdaq composite did continue to fall for two days after the initial plunge .
wsj_1140	4	However , the short interest figures reported by brokerage and securities clearing firms to the National Association of Securities Dealers include only those trades completed , or settled , by Oct. 13 , rather than trades that occurred on that day , according to Gene Finn , chief economist for the NASD .
wsj_1140	5	Generally , it takes five business days to transfer stock and to take the other steps necessary to settle a trade .
wsj_1140	6	The total short interest in Nasdaq stocks as of mid-October was 237.1 million shares , up from 223.7 million in September but well below the record level of 279 million shares established in July 1987 .
wsj_1140	7	The sharp rise in OTC short interest compares with the 4.2 % decline in short interest on the New York Stock Exchange and the 3 % rise on the American Stock Exchange during the September-October period .
wsj_1140	8	Generally , a short seller expects a fall in a stock 's price and aims to profit by selling borrowed shares that are to be replaced later ; the short seller hopes the replacement shares bought later will cost less than those that were sold .
wsj_1140	9	Short interest , which represents the number of shares borrowed and sold , but not yet replaced , can be a bad-expectations barometer for many stocks .
wsj_1140	10	Among 2,412 of the largest OTC issues , short interest rose to 196.8 million shares , from 185.7 million in 2,379 stocks in September .
wsj_1140	11	Big stocks with large short interest gains as of Oct. 13 included First Executive , Intel , Campeau and LIN Broadcasting .
wsj_1140	12	Short interest in First Executive , an insurance issue , rose 55 % to 3.8 million .
wsj_1140	13	Intel 's short interest jumped 42 % , while Campeau 's increased 62 % .
wsj_1140	14	Intel makes semiconductors and Campeau operates department-store chains and is strained for cash .
wsj_1140	15	Meritor Savings again had the dubious honor of being the OTC stock with the biggest short interest position on Nasdaq .
wsj_1140	16	Meritor has headed the list since May .
wsj_1140	17	First Executive and troubled Valley National Corp. of Arizona were next in line .
wsj_1140	18	Short selling is n't necessarily bad for the overall market .
wsj_1140	19	Shorted shares must eventually be replaced through buying .
wsj_1140	20	In addition , changes in short interest in some stocks may be caused by arbitrage .
wsj_1140	21	For example , an investor may seek to profit during some takeover situations by buying stock in one company involved and shorting the stock of the other .
wsj_1140	22	Two big stocks involved in takeover activity saw their short interest surge .
wsj_1140	23	Short interest in the American depositary receipts of Jaguar , the target of both Ford Motor and General Motors , more than doubled .
wsj_1140	24	Nasdaq stocks that showed a drop in short interest included Adobe Systems , Class A shares of Tele-Communications and takeover targets Lyphomed and Jerrico .
wsj_1140	25	The NASD , which operates the Nasdaq computer system on which 5,200 OTC issues trade , compiles short interest data in two categories : the approximately two-thirds , and generally biggest , Nasdaq stocks that trade on the National Market System ; and the one-third , and generally smaller , Nasdaq stocks that are n't a part of the system .
wsj_1140	26	Short interest in 1,327 non-NMS securities totaled 40.3 million shares , compared with almost 38 million shares in 1,310 issues in September .
wsj_1140	27	The October short interest represents 1.04 days of average daily trading volume in the smaller stocks in the system for the reporting period , compared with 0.94 day a month ago .
wsj_1140	28	Among bigger OTC stocks , the figures represent 2.05 days of average daily volume , compared with 2.14 days in September .
wsj_1140	29	The adjacent tables show the issues in which a short interest position of at least 50,000 shares existed as of Oct. 13 or in which there was a short position change of at least 25,000 shares since Sept. 15 see accompanying tables -- WSJ Oct. 25 , 1989 .
wsj_1141	0	From the Sept. 30-Oct . 4 issue of The Economist :
wsj_1141	1	What defeated General Aoun was not only the weight of the Syrian army .
wsj_1141	2	The weight of Lebanon 's history was also against him ; and it is a history Israel is in danger of repeating .
wsj_1141	3	Like Lebanon , and however unfairly , Israel is regarded by the Arab world as a colonial aberration .
wsj_1141	4	Its best hope of acceptance by its neighbours lies in reaching a settlement with the Palestinians .
wsj_1141	5	Like Lebanon , Israel is being remade by demography .
wsj_1141	6	In Greater Israel more than half the children under six are Muslims .
wsj_1141	7	Within 25 years Jews will probably be the minority .
wsj_1141	8	Yet Israel will neither share power with all these Arabs nor , says its present prime minister , redraw its borders closer to its pre-1967 Jewish heartland .
wsj_1141	9	By not choosing one of these options , Israelis will condemn themselves , as the Maronites did , to perpetual war with the Muslims in their midst , and so to the internal erosion of their state .
wsj_1141	10	Unlike the Maronites , Israel 's Jews will not let themselves become the weakest force in a system of private armies ; Jerusalem will become Belfast before it becomes Beirut .
wsj_1141	11	But that is not much of a consolation to draw from the failure of General Aoun .
wsj_1142	0	The Nasdaq over-the-counter market did n't fully recover from a selling stampede , and closed down 1.2 % .
wsj_1142	1	The effects on the market of the mostly computer-driven sell-off among exchange-listed stocks irked many market makers , who watched the Nasdaq Composite Index tumble in sympathy with the Dow Jones Industrial Average , and then saw it get left behind in the subsequent rally .
wsj_1142	2	After plummeting 1.8 % at one point during the day , the composite rebounded a little , but finished down 5.52 , at 461.70 .
wsj_1142	3	In contrast , the industrial average recovered almost completely from its skid and closed down 0.1 % .
wsj_1142	4	The New York Stock Exchange Composite was 0.4 % lower for the day .
wsj_1142	5	As usual , the over-the-counter market 's biggest technology stocks were hardest hit .
wsj_1142	6	Microsoft , battered by profit taking in recent sessions , sank as much as 4 ; but it finished at 80 7/8 , down 2 1/4 on volume of one million shares .
wsj_1142	7	MCI Communications , the most active issue , finished down 5/8 to 42 1/8 .
wsj_1142	8	MCI traded as low as 41 3/8 during the session .
wsj_1142	9	Other active stocks included Jaguar , whose American depositary receipts added 1/8 to 11 1/4 .
wsj_1142	10	Apple Computer improved 7/8 to 47 5/8 ; Intel slipped 1/4 to 33 1/4 , and Valley National Corp. was up 1/8 to 15 1/8 .
wsj_1142	11	`` The market started with several strikes against it , '' said Peter DaPuzzo , head of retail equity trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton , referring to news that the labor-management buy-out of UAL Corp. continued to unravel , and reports that the junk-bond market is disintegrating .
wsj_1142	12	But the computer-guided selling in response to those developments dealt a serious blow to the over-the-counter market , Mr. DaPuzzo said .
wsj_1142	13	Even though the over-the-counter market usually does n't fall by as much as listed stocks during program-selling blitzes , he said , `` when the market does recover , the damage is done and it leaves Nasdaq down more than the Big Board . ''
wsj_1142	14	Mr. DaPuzzo also complained that the sharp swings in stock prices lately is scaring away retail and foreign investors .
wsj_1142	15	While Shearson does n't do computer-guided program trading for its own account , the firm does execute orders for clients involved in the buying and selling of shares tied to movements in certain stock indexes , Mr. DaPuzzo acknowledged .
wsj_1142	16	The volatility inherent in program trading troubled other traders , too .
wsj_1142	17	They do n't like the risks they are forced to assume when prices swing so drastically .
wsj_1142	18	Market makers are supposed to keep supplies of stocks on hand to maintain orderly trading when imbalances occur .
wsj_1142	19	That means that on days when prices are tumbling and sellers abound they must be willing to buy shares from sellers when no one else will .
wsj_1142	20	In such an environment , a market maker can absorb huge losses .
wsj_1142	21	But the recent volatility in stock prices caused by the program trading has made some market makers less willing to soak up the stocks that are for sale .
wsj_1142	22	The market makers say they are n't comfortable carrying big positions in stocks because they realize prices can tumble quickly .
wsj_1142	23	The situation makes it harder to buy and sell shares quickly , exacerbating the rise and fall in stock prices during program-dominated trading .
wsj_1142	24	Groused Robert Antolini , head of over-the-counter trading at Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette : `` It 's making it tough for traders to make money . ''
wsj_1142	25	He said that when sell programs kick in , many traders believe that `` there 's no sense in sticking your nose out because you 're an instant loser . ''
wsj_1142	26	Kinder-Care Learning Centers added 1/4 to 4 7/8 on 461,200 shares .
wsj_1142	27	Lodestar Group said it will make a $ 6-a-share offer for the remaining Kinder-Care Learning Center common stock if it acquires a majority of the company 's shares in a pending rights offering by Kinder-Care Learning Center 's parent , Kinder-Care Inc .
wsj_1142	28	Shares of KinderCare Inc. closed at 3 1/2 , also up 1/4 , on volume of 700,000 .
wsj_1142	29	Ohio Casualty dropped 2 1/8 to 49 1/2 .
wsj_1142	30	The company posted third-quarter earnings of 95 cents a share , down from $ 1.26 a year earlier .
wsj_1142	31	The company estimated that losses from Hurricane Hugo reduced net income by 32 cents a share in the most recent quarter .
wsj_1142	32	The company said losses from the Oct. 17 earthquake in California have n't yet been determined , but that it provides earthquake coverage to about 1,400 properties in the stricken area .
wsj_1142	33	Any quake-related losses will be reported in the fourth quarter , the company said .
wsj_1142	34	North Atlantic Industries jumped 1 to 5 3/4 .
wsj_1142	35	The electronics-instruments maker is to be acquired by Asset Management Associates for $ 7.25 a share .
wsj_1142	36	LIN Broadcasting slid 1 3/8 to 108 3/4 , despite reporting third-quarter net of 46 cents a share , up from 39 cents the previous year .
wsj_1142	37	The company said the latest quarter included about $ 3.4 million in special legal and financial advisory costs related to McCaw Cellular Communications ' bid for the company and LIN 's merger pact with BellSouth .
wsj_1142	38	McCaw was unchanged at 40 .
wsj_1142	39	XL/Datacomp slid 2 1/4 to 16 1/2 amid continuing concerns about the company 's contract negotiations with International Business Machines .
wsj_1142	40	IBM is reviewing its entire business-partners program , and XL/Datacomp confirmed earlier this month that it was in talks with the company about possible modifications to its current IBM-remarketer contract .
wsj_1142	41	Remarketers make modifications to IBM 's computer hardware and resell the products .
wsj_1142	42	Omni Capital Group surged 1 3/4 to 16 1/4 .
wsj_1142	43	The company said net rose to 38 cents a share in its fiscal-first quarter ended Sept. 30 , from 35 cents a shares a year ago .
wsj_1144	0	Manville Corp. said it offered to buy $ 500 million of its convertible preferred stock from the Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trust in a move that would improve the trust 's liquidity and reduce the potential number of Manville shares outstanding .
wsj_1144	1	Manville said it made the offer within the past several weeks as part of an effort to improve shareholder value .
wsj_1144	2	It said it would purchase the stock at market price .
wsj_1144	3	Manville and a spokeswoman for the trust said that the two are discussing the proposal but a decision has n't been made .
wsj_1144	4	`` We are considering that offer along with all other alternatives , '' the trust spokeswoman said .
wsj_1144	5	`` We need to look at how to maximize our cash flow to pay our beneficiaries . ''
wsj_1144	6	The trust , created as part of Manville 's bankruptcy-law reorganization to compensate victims of asbestos-related diseases , owns 7.2 million of the Series A convertible preferred shares , which are each convertible into 10 Manville common shares .
wsj_1144	7	The trust also owns half of Manville 's 48 million common shares outstanding .
wsj_1144	8	Based on Manville 's closing price yesterday of $ 9.25 a share , Manville 's offer would purchase about 5.4 million of its preferred shares , or about 75 % of the trust 's preferred stock holding .
wsj_1144	9	In addition to the stock and 20 % of Manville 's profits beginning in 1992 , the trust is supposed to receive $ 2.5 billion over its 27-year life .
wsj_1144	10	But it initially was funded with about $ 765 million and may soon face a cash crunch .
wsj_1144	11	As of June 30 , it had settled about 15,000 of 81,000 claims filed and its unpaid claims totaled $ 136 million , a large portion of its $ 268 million in cash and marketable securities .
wsj_1144	12	Since most of its assets are tied to Manville , a forest and building products concern , the trust might also want to diversify its holdings .
wsj_1144	13	As part of its offer , Manville said it requested changes in some covenants between it and the trust to allow Manville to `` reflect a more typical corporate ownership and financial structure . ''
wsj_1144	14	A Manville spokesman would n't elaborate on the proposed changes .
wsj_1144	15	But he said they are `` to a large degree , housekeeping , '' although some may generate some disagreement .
wsj_1144	16	Manville said the shares issued to the trust were intended to be sold , as needed , and that Manville has the right of first refusal to buy those shares .
wsj_1145	0	Northeast Utilities raised its bid for Public Service Co. of New Hampshire , which is operating under Bankruptcy Code protection , to $ 2.25 billion from $ 1.85 billion .
wsj_1145	1	Northeast 's raised bid , which was supported by PS of New Hampshire 's official shareholder committee , is a prelude to what is expected to be a round of higher bids by the other groups trying to acquire the company , the largest utility in New Hampshire .
wsj_1145	2	The $ 2.25 billion value claimed by Northeast , based in Hartford , Conn. , is the highest yet given to a bid .
wsj_1145	3	Some of the three other bidding groups are expected to increase their offers tomorrow , a date set for revised offers by a bankruptcy court judge .
wsj_1145	4	A hearing is set for Nov. 15 , but participants do n't expect a resolution until July 1990 .
wsj_1145	5	Under the new Northeast Utilities plan , it would pay $ 1.65 billion in cash to creditors and assume $ 100 million in pollution control bonds .
wsj_1145	6	Secured creditors would recover both principal and interest , while unsecured creditors would receive only principal and interest accrued before PS of New Hampshire filed for Bankruptcy Code protection in January
wsj_1145	7	The biggest change in Northeast 's offer was in improvements made for equity holders who had been given short shrift previously .
wsj_1145	8	Assuming full operation of the Seabrook nuclear power plant , which is completed but is n't yet operating , equity holders would receive up to $ 500 million in cash , preferred stock and new 10-year Seabrook bonds .
wsj_1145	9	Northeast 's previous offer had proposed that equity holders receive just $ 165 million .
wsj_1145	10	In addition , Northeast promised the State of New Hampshire that rate increases would be limited to 5.5 % annually for seven years .
wsj_1145	11	Its previous proposal had conditioned rate limits on Seabrook operations and other contingencies .
wsj_1145	12	Wilbur Ross , financial adviser to the equity holders said , `` Given the state 's strong bargaining position ... we believe the NU plan provides the best recovery available '' to PS of New Hampshire 's equity holders .
wsj_1145	13	Officials of PS of New Hampshire could n't be reached for comment .
wsj_1145	14	The company has filed an internal reorganization plan it valued at $ 2.2 billion that would require 5.5 % rate increases .
wsj_1145	15	That plan would leave existing preferred shareholders with at least a 41 % stake and give common shareholders as little as 13 % .
wsj_1145	16	New England Electric System , Westborough , Mass. , has proposed buying the company for $ 2 billion as part of a plan that would require rate increases of only 4.8 % annually for seven years .
wsj_1145	17	The state of New Hampshire has favored that plan .
wsj_1145	18	The other bidder is United Illuminating Co. , New Haven , Conn. , with a bid valued at $ 2.2 billion and and a proposal for seven years of 5.5 % rate increases .
wsj_1149	0	The Justice Department is in the process of trying to gain control over a law that federal Judge David Sentelle recently called a `` monster . ''
wsj_1149	1	Needless to say , he was talking about RICO .
wsj_1149	2	With its recently revised guidelines for RICO , Justice makes it clear that the law currently holds too many incentives for abuse by prosecutors .
wsj_1149	3	The text of the `` new policy '' guidelines from the Criminal Division are reprinted nearby .
wsj_1149	4	They strongly suggest that Justice 's prosecutions of Drexel Burnham Lambert , Michael Milken and Princeton/Newport violated notions of fundamental fairness .
wsj_1149	5	Justice is attempting to avoid a replay of these tactics .
wsj_1149	6	This amounts to an extraordinary repudiation of the tenure of New York mayoral candidate and former U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani , who was more inclined to gathering scalps than understanding markets .
wsj_1149	7	The new guidelines limit the pretrial forfeitures of assets of RICOed defendants and their investors , clients , bankers and others .
wsj_1149	8	This follows earlier new guidelines from the Tax Division prohibiting Princeton/Newport-like tax cases from masquerading as RICO cases .
wsj_1149	9	The forfeiture memo cited `` considerable criticism in the press , because of a perception that pre-trial freezing of assets is tantamount to a seizure of property without due process . ''
wsj_1149	10	It told prosecutors not to seek forfeitures if there are `` less intrusive '' alternatives , such as bonds , and in any case not to seek forfeitures `` disproportionate to the defendant 's crime . ''
wsj_1149	11	These changes come a tad late for Princeton/Newport , the first RICOed securities firm .
wsj_1149	12	It was forced into liquidation before trial when investors yanked their funds after the government demanded a huge pre-trial asset forfeiture .
wsj_1149	13	Princeton/Newport investors , including McKinsey & Co. and the Harvard endowment , made the rational decision to withdraw their money ; for the firm , the liquidation was sentence first , verdict later .
wsj_1149	14	Prosecutors wanted $ 23.8 million in forfeiture for alleged tax fraud of some $ 400,000 .
wsj_1149	15	The experience of Princeton/Newport and initiation of other RICO-forfeiture cases against legitimate businesses taught Drexel that a RICOed investment bank would be an ex-investment bank .
wsj_1149	16	Drexel therefore agreed instead to an arrangement allowing it to plea to charges `` which the company is not in a position to dispute '' because of RICO .
wsj_1149	17	Part of Drexel 's plea was to cut Mr. Milken loose .
wsj_1149	18	So after all the prosecutorial hoopla no one has established what , if anything , Drexel did wrong .
wsj_1149	19	So two cheers for the new rules .
wsj_1149	20	Justice has finally recognized its employees ' abuses , thanks largely to the demands for reform by former U.S. attorney in Washington Joseph diGenova , who wants to salvage RICO for real criminals .
wsj_1149	21	But prosecutorial guidelines are effective only if someone at Justice is willing and able to supervise hyperactive prosecutors .
wsj_1149	22	Judge Sentelle , of the appeals court in Washington , made this point at a Cato Institute conference last week in a remarkable speech titled , `` RICO : The Monster That Ate Jurisprudence . ''
wsj_1149	23	He said ours is supposed to be `` a government of laws not of men , '' and yet RICO defenders `` tell us that we should rely on prosecutorial discretion to protect against overbreadth of RICO . ''
wsj_1149	24	No prosecutorial guidelines , observed or unobserved , limit civil RICO cases by plaintiffs for damages .
wsj_1149	25	What now for Princeton/Newport officials , Drexel and Mr. Milken ?
wsj_1149	26	Justice should review these cases to see what other prosecutorial abuses may have occurred .
wsj_1149	27	We suspect that Justice will some day agree that only the complete repeal of RICO can guarantee an end to injustices in its name .
wsj_1150	0	`` The Famous Teddy Z , '' which CBS Inc. had hoped would emerge as one of the few bright spots in its otherwise lackluster prime-time schedule , is n't turning out to be the hit the network envisaged .
wsj_1150	1	Although the half-hour situation comedy seen Mondays at 9:30 p.m . Eastern and Pacific time is n't a candidate for cancellation , it is slated for fine-tuning and by next week the network may announce `` Teddy Z '' is moving to 8:30 p.m. from its 9:30 time slot , replacing `` The People Next Door , '' which became the first network show to be canceled this season .
wsj_1150	2	`` Teddy Z , '' which centers on a mailroom clerk-turned agent at a Hollywood talent agency , was scheduled in the coveted 9:30 p.m. slot to follow `` Murphy Brown , '' a situation comedy about a television news magazine , starring Candice Bergen .
wsj_1150	3	`` Teddy Z '' was boosted by favorable reviews and a network-wide promotional tie-in contest with K mart Corp .
wsj_1150	4	It was promoted on cable services , including MTV , Nick at Night and VH-1 , and premiered as the No. 22-rated show for the week .
wsj_1150	5	But five weeks after the premiere , the series has floundered .
wsj_1150	6	In figures released yesterday by A.C. Nielsen Co . `` Teddy Z , '' produced by the television unit of Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. , was in 37th place .
wsj_1150	7	Worse , every week it suffers audience drop-off from `` Murphy Brown '' and viewership on CBS picks up again once `` Teddy Z '' is over and is followed by `` Designing Women . ''
wsj_1150	8	`` There is strong indication that ` Teddy Z ' is not compatible with the shows it is surrounding , '' said John Sisk , senior vice president at J. Walter Thompson Co. , a unit of WPP Group PLC .
wsj_1150	9	Last week , `` Murphy Brown '' was viewed by 14.1 % of the available television households , while the number dropped to 12.6 % for `` Teddy Z '' and rose to 14.2 % for `` Designing Women . ''
wsj_1150	10	CBS executives said the program is also slated to undergo some plot changes .
wsj_1150	11	Creator Hugh Wilson , for example , included the lead character 's Greek family in the cast , `` but that is not the right focus anymore , '' said one CBS executive .
wsj_1150	12	Instead , CBS hopes the show will increasingly highlight the talent agency and the business of being an agent .
wsj_1150	13	`` We 're making adjustments on the show , yes , but nothing radical , '' said Craig Nelson , the story consultant on `` Teddy Z . ''
wsj_1150	14	`` But we hope to keep a balance between the office and the family . ''
wsj_1150	15	The opening credits are being redone , Mr. Nelson said , `` to make Teddy 's situation clear to viewers who have not been with us since the beginning .
wsj_1150	16	Those viewers find the show confusing .
wsj_1151	0	The stock market 's woes spooked currency traders but prompted a quiet little party among bond investors .
wsj_1151	1	Prices of long-term Treasury bonds moved inversely to the stock market as investors sought safety amid growing evidence the economy is weakening .
wsj_1151	2	But the shaky economic outlook and the volatile stock market forced the dollar lower against major currencies .
wsj_1151	3	The bond market got an early boost from the opening-hour sell-off in stocks .
wsj_1151	4	That rout was triggered by UAL Corp. 's announcement late Monday that the proposed management-labor buy-out had collapsed .
wsj_1151	5	The 80-point decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average during the morning trading session touched off a flight to safety that saw investors shifting assets from stocks to Treasury bonds .
wsj_1151	6	At its strongest , the Treasury 's benchmark 30-year bond rose more than a point , or more than $ 10 for each $ 1,000 face amount .
wsj_1151	7	As the stock market recovered some of its losses later in the day , bond prices retreated .
wsj_1151	8	But analysts said the combination of a second consecutive decline in monthly durable-goods orders and lackluster mid-October auto sales helped prop up the Treasury market .
wsj_1151	9	A slowing economy and the implication of lower inflation and interest rates tend to bolster bond prices .
wsj_1151	10	On the surface , the decline in September durable goods -- only 0.1 % -- did n't appear very weak .
wsj_1151	11	But orders for non-defense capital goods , a precursor of future plant and equipment spending , were off 5.6 % after falling 10.3 % in August .
wsj_1151	12	Auto makers reported that mid-October sales were running at an annual rate of about 5.8 million units , far less than the 6.6 million units analysts had expected .
wsj_1151	13	Taken together , the auto-sales and durable-goods reports confirmed perceptions that the economy is bogging down .
wsj_1151	14	Although analysts do n't expect the Federal Reserve to ease credit policy soon , reports like those yesterday help build the case for lower rates .
wsj_1151	15	Now bond investors are looking toward next week 's report from national purchasing managers and the government 's October employment report as potentially prompting the Fed to lower rates .
wsj_1151	16	The stock market 's precipitous drop frightened foreign investors , who quickly bid the dollar lower .
wsj_1151	17	But as stock prices recovered some of the early losses , so did the U.S. currency .
wsj_1151	18	Although dealers said investors are becoming more bearish toward the dollar in the wake of the stock market 's recent troubles and as the U.S. economy weakens , the dollar ended down only modestly .
wsj_1151	19	In major market activity : Bond prices rose .
wsj_1151	20	The Treasury 's benchmark 30-year bond gained nearly half a point , or about $ 5 for each $ 1,000 face amount .
wsj_1151	21	The yield on the issue slipped to 7.89 % .
wsj_1151	22	In late New York trading the currency was quoted at 1.8355 marks and 141.45 yen , compared with 1.8470 marks and 141.90 yen Monday .
wsj_1152	0	`` Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous '' may be visiting some new venues in the near future .
wsj_1152	1	Judge Robert `` Maximum Bob '' Potter sentenced Jim Bakker to 45 years in the big house yesterday , while a Beverly Hills judge tucked away Zsa Zsa Gabor for three days , plus 120 hours of work with homeless women .
wsj_1152	2	Miss Gabor recanted her earlier-expressed fear of jailhouse lesbians .
wsj_1152	3	Mr. Bakker said he was guilty of sin but not fraud .

wsj_1153	0	Boeing Co. said Trans European Airways ordered a dozen 737 jetliners valued at a total of about $ 450 million .
wsj_1153	1	The 300 and 400 series aircraft will be powered by engines jointly produced by General Electric Co. and Snecma of France .
wsj_1153	2	Currently , Boeing has a backlog of about $ 80 billion , but production has been slowed by a strike of 55,000 machinists , which entered its 22nd day today .
wsj_1153	3	Last week , a mediator failed to rekindle talks between the company and the strikers , who have rejected a pay raise offer of 10 % over three years .
wsj_1155	0	Cray Research Inc. forecast that 1990 will be a no-growth year for its supercomputer line .
wsj_1155	1	In what has become a series of bad-news announcements , the world 's largest maker of supercomputers said that after reviewing its order prospects , `` we have concluded it is prudent to plan for next year on the assumption that revenue again will be flat . ''
wsj_1155	2	Cray jolted the market in July when it slashed revenue and earnings projections for this year , citing a slowing economy that has delayed orders from government as well as commercial customers .
wsj_1155	3	The company made its 1990 projection -- an unusual event for Cray -- in announcing improved net income for the third quarter .
wsj_1155	4	Cray said it earned $ 30.6 million , or $ 1.04 a share , up 35 % from $ 22.6 million , or 73 cents a share , a year ago .
wsj_1155	5	Revenue gained 45 % to $ 210.2 million from $ 145.2 million .
wsj_1155	6	For the nine months , earnings totaled $ 36.6 million , or $ 1.24 a share , down 46 % from $ 68.1 million , or $ 2.19 a share , a year earlier .
wsj_1155	7	Revenue was $ 454.6 million , a 6.9 % gain from $ 425.4 million .
wsj_1155	8	Cray made its announcement after the stock market closed .
wsj_1155	9	In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , Cray closed down $ 1.125 at $ 34.25 .
wsj_1155	10	Cray said its order backlog at Sept. 30 was $ 315 million , down $ 25 million from June 30 .
wsj_1155	11	Marcello Gumucio , president , said the company `` did well in the quarter as far as revenues and earnings are concerned , and not quite as well in terms of signing orders . ''
wsj_1155	12	As for the current period , Mr. Gumucio said , `` We anticipate that fourth-quarter revenue and earnings will be substantially greater than any of the preceding three quarters , but not up to the record levels of last year 's fourth quarter '' when Cray earned $ 88.5 million , or $ 2.80 a share .
wsj_1155	13	He added that the company expects `` strong '' operating profit for the year , `` but at a level significantly lower than last year . ''
wsj_1155	14	He said 1989 's net income could be 11 % to 13 % of revenue , which , assuming current expectations , would be 40 % to 45 % below 1988 's level .
wsj_1155	15	Last year , Cray earned $ 156.6 million , or $ 4.99 a share , on revenue of $ 756.3 million .
wsj_1155	16	Next year `` looks dismal , '' said analyst Paul Luber of Robert Baird & Co. , Milwaukee .
wsj_1155	17	Noting that Cray does n't have a low-end supercomputer to compete with the likes of Convex Computer Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. , Mr. Luber said such a machine would be necessary `` to get things back on line here . ''
wsj_1155	18	Cray has indicated it will decide on whether to build such a machine before year end .
wsj_1156	0	Johnson & Johnson reported a 10 % rise in third-quarter net income on a 12 % sales increase - results that were driven particularly by new products including pharmaceuticals and the company 's professional operations .
wsj_1156	1	Net for the New Brunswick , N.J. , maker of health-care products climbed to $ 265 million , or 80 cents a share , from $ 240 million , or 71 cents a share , in the year-earlier period .
wsj_1156	2	Sales rose to $ 2.45 billion from $ 2.2 billion .
wsj_1156	3	The year-ago per-share earnings are adjusted to reflect a 2-for-1 stock split last May .
wsj_1156	4	In a statement , Ralph S. Larsen , chairman and chief executive officer , said the company was pleased with its third-quarter sales performance , `` especially in light of the extremely competitive environment in domestic consumer markets and the negative impact of unfavorable exchange rates this quarter . ''
wsj_1156	5	David J. Lothson , an industry analyst for PaineWebber Group Inc. , said Johnson & Johnson 's results slightly exceeded his expectations for the third quarter .
wsj_1156	6	In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , Johnson & Johnson shares fell 37.5 cents to $ 54.625 .
wsj_1156	7	Mr. Larsen noted `` substantial sales growth '' for the recently introduced Acuvue disposable contact lens and Hismanal , a once-a-day antihistamine .
wsj_1156	8	Eprex , used by dialysis patients who are anemic , and Prepulsid , a gastro-intestinal drug , did well overseas , he said .
wsj_1156	9	Despite health-care cost controls and programs to hold down inventory , the professional division , which makes products including sutures and surgical stapling equipment , `` achieved solid growth , '' Johnson & Johnson said .
wsj_1156	10	But domestic consumer sales slipped 1.2 % for the quarter , to $ 490 million from $ 496 million .
wsj_1156	11	The company cited softness in the retail health and beauty aids category , `` as well as the intense competition in the company 's sanitary protection product line . ''
wsj_1156	12	Overseas sales were stronger , principally because of a rebound in Brazil , where economic turmoil had hurt year-earlier results , Johnson & Johnson said .
wsj_1156	13	Mr. Lothson of PaineWebber said the company 's sales pace has been picking up largely because the effect of unfavorable exchange rates has been easing -- a pattern continuing this quarter .
wsj_1156	14	He cautioned , however , that a `` tough tax-rate comparison '' may slow the company 's earnings growth for the current quarter .
wsj_1156	15	For last year 's fourth quarter , the company 's tax rate was less than 20 % , he said .
wsj_1156	16	While the third period contained no major surprises , Mr. Lothson said , the results show how sensitive the multinationals can be to developments in a single country such as Brazil .
wsj_1156	17	He also questioned whether recent gains in that country can be sustained .
wsj_1156	18	The following issues were recently filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission :
wsj_1156	19	Bergen Brunswig Corp. , proposed offering of liquid yield option notes , via Merrill Lynch Capital Markets .
wsj_1156	20	Columbia Gas System Inc. , shelf offering of up to $ 200 million of debentures .
wsj_1156	21	Laserscope , initial offering of 1,656,870 common shares , of which 1,455,000 shares are to be sold by the company and 201,870 by holders , via Alex . Brown & Sons Inc. and Volpe , Covington & Welty .
wsj_1156	22	TeleVideo Systems Inc. , proposed offering of 1,853,735 common shares , to be sold by holders .
wsj_1156	23	Western Gas System Inc. , initial offering of 3,250,000 common shares , of which 3,040,000 shares will be sold by the company and 210,000 by a holder , via Prudential-Bache Capital Funding , Smith Barney , Harris Upham & Co. and Hanifen , Imhoff Inc .
wsj_1157	0	Insiders have been selling shares in Dun & Bradstreet Corp. , the huge credit-information concern .
wsj_1157	1	Six top executives at the New York-based company sold shares in August and September .
wsj_1157	2	Four of those insiders sold more than half their holdings .
wsj_1157	3	The stock , in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , closed at $ 51.75 , up 62.5 cents , well below the $ 56.13 to $ 60 a share the insiders received for their shares .
wsj_1157	4	Much of the recent slide in Dun & Bradstreet 's stock came late last week , after negative comments by analysts at Merrill Lynch & Co. and Goldman , Sachs & Co .
wsj_1157	5	A company spokesman declined to comment and said that the officials who sold shares would n't comment .
wsj_1157	6	One of Dun & Bradstreet 's chief businesses is compiling reports that rate the credit-worthiness of millions of American companies .
wsj_1157	7	It also owns Moody 's Investors Service , which assigns credit-ratings to bonds and preferred stock ; A.C. Nielsen , known for its data on television-viewing patterns , and Yellow-pages publisher Donnelley .
wsj_1157	8	Last March , this newspaper reported on widespread allegations that the company misled many customers into purchasing more credit-data services than needed .
wsj_1157	9	In June , the company agreed to settle for $ 18 million several lawsuits related to its sales practices , without admitting or denying the charges .
wsj_1157	10	An investigation by U.S. Postal inspectors is continuing .
wsj_1157	11	Among the insider sales , Charles Raikes , the firm 's general counsel , sold 12,281 shares in August , representing 46 % of his holdings in the company .
wsj_1157	12	He received $ 724,579 for the shares , according to insider filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission .
wsj_1157	13	John C. Holt , an executive vice president and Dun & Bradstreet director , sold 10,000 shares on Aug. 31 for $ 588,800 , filings show .
wsj_1157	14	He retains 9,232 shares .
wsj_1157	15	William H.J. Buchanan , the firm 's secretary and associate general counsel , sold 7,000 shares in two separate sales in September for $ 406,000 .
wsj_1157	16	The shares represented 66 % of his Dun & Bradstreet holdings , according to the company .
wsj_1157	17	The other insiders , all senior or executive vice presidents , sold between 2,520 and 6,881 shares , representing between 8 % and 70 % of their holdings , according to SEC filings .
wsj_1157	18	Dun & Bradstreet 's stock price began its recent spiral downward last Wednesday , when the company reported third-quarter results .
wsj_1157	19	Net income rose to 83 cents a share from 72 cents a share the year-earlier period .
wsj_1157	20	But analysts focused more on the drop in revenue , to $ 1.04 billion from $ 1.07 billion , reflecting in part a continuing drop in sales of the controversial credit-reporting services .
wsj_1157	21	Last Thursday , Merrill Lynch securities analyst Peter Falco downgraded his investment rating on the firm , according to Dow Jones Professional Investors Report , citing a slowdown in the credit-reporting business .
wsj_1157	22	He cut his rating to a short-term hold from above-average performer and reduced his 1990 earnings estimate .
wsj_1157	23	Mr. Falco continues to rank the stock a longterm buy .
wsj_1157	24	The stock slid $ 1.875 on more than four times average daily volume .
wsj_1157	25	The stock received another blow on Friday , when Goldman Sachs analyst Eric Philo advised that investors with short-term horizons should avoid Dun & Bradstreet stock because it is unlikely to outperform the market .
wsj_1157	26	The stock fell 75 cents .
wsj_1157	27	Insider selling is not unusual at Dun & Bradstreet ; in fact , the recent pace of selling is just about average for the company , according to figures compiled by Invest/Net , a North Miami , Fla. , firm that specializes in tracking and analyzing SEC insider filings .
wsj_1157	28	But previous sales have often been sales of shares purchased through the exercise of stock options and sold six months later , as soon as allowed , said Robert Gabele , president of Invest/Net .
wsj_1157	29	The most recent sales do n't appear to be option-related , he said .
wsj_1157	30	Michael A. Miles , chief executive officer of Philip Morris Cos . ' Kraft General Foods unit , bought 6,000 shares of the company on Sept. 22 for $ 157 each .
wsj_1157	31	The $ 942,000 purchase raised his holdings to 74,000 shares .
wsj_1157	32	The stock split four-for-one on Oct. 10 .
wsj_1157	33	Mr. Miles 's newly purchased shares are now worth $ 1,068,000 , based on Philip Morris 's closing price of $ 44.50 , up 62.5 cents , in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday .
wsj_1157	34	A spokesman for Mr. Miles said he bought the shares because he felt they were `` a good investment . ''
wsj_1157	35	The executive made his purchases shortly before being named to his current chief executive officer 's position ; formerly he was Kraft General Foods ' chief operating officer .
wsj_1157	36	Two directors of Pegasus Gold Inc. , a Spokane , Wash. , precious-metals mining firm , sold most of their holdings in the company Aug. 31 .
wsj_1157	37	John J. Crabb sold 4,500 shares for $ 11.13 each , leaving himself with a stake of 500 shares .
wsj_1157	38	He received $ 50,085 .
wsj_1157	39	Peter Kutney sold 5,000 shares , all of his holdings , for $ 11.38 a share , or $ 56,900 .
wsj_1157	40	Gary Straub , corporate counsel for the company , said the directors sold for `` personal financial reasons . ''
wsj_1157	41	Both insiders declined to comment .
wsj_1157	42	On Wall Street , Merrill Lynch & Co. analyst Daniel A. Roling rates the stock `` neutral '' and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. lists it as a `` buy . ''
wsj_1157	43	Pegasus Gold `` has been on a lot of recommended lists as a junior growth company stepping into the big leagues , '' says Marty McNeill , metals analyst at Dominick & Dominick , a New York investment firm .
wsj_1157	44	`` It 's a good company , and growing ; there 's nothing that would warrant that it be sold . ''
wsj_1157	45	Yesterday , in composite trading on the American Stock Exchange , Pegasus closed at $ 10.125 , up 12.5 cents .
wsj_1159	0	The Justice Department scrambled to play down the significance of its new guidelines concerning prosecutions under the federal racketeering law .
wsj_1159	1	The guidelines were distributed to U.S. attorneys last summer but were disclosed for the first time by press reports this week .
wsj_1159	2	They discourage prosecutors , under certain circumstances , from seeking court orders seizing the assets of racketeering defendants prior to trial .
wsj_1159	3	But David Runkel , chief Justice Department spokesman , said the guidelines `` are a codification and a clarification far more than a new direction . ''
wsj_1159	4	Use of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law against white-collar defendants , as opposed to alleged organized-crime figures , has come under attack from some defense lawyers and legal scholars .
wsj_1159	5	Critics have complained that the law unfairly strips defendants of assets before a jury determines they have committed a crime and that aggressive use of the forfeiture provisions can ruin corporate defendants or force them into unfavorable plea bargains .
wsj_1159	6	In the new guidelines , the Justice Department says that in attempting to freeze disputed assets before trial , `` the government will not seek to disrupt the normal , legitimate business activities of the defendant '' and `` will not seek ... to take from third parties assets legitimately transferred to them . ''
wsj_1159	7	The guidelines also state , `` The government 's policy is not to seek the fullest forfeiture permissible under the law where that forfeiture would be disproportionate to the defendant 's crime . ''
wsj_1159	8	Another provision clarifies certain limits on when prosecutors may use tax-fraud charges as a basis for bringing a racketeering case .
wsj_1159	9	Mr. Runkel declined to speculate on whether the guidelines would curb racketeering prosecutions against corporate defendants .
wsj_1159	10	`` The impact , if there is any , will be impossible to judge ahead of time because the decision whether to use racketeering charges is made in individual cases '' by Justice Department officials in Washington , he said .
wsj_1159	11	In a memorandum describing the guidelines , Assistant Attorney General Edward Dennis Jr. said that government efforts to freeze defendants ' assets pending racketeering prosecutions `` have been the subject of considerable criticism in the press . ''
wsj_1159	12	But Mr. Runkel said the government is n't `` backing off on these kinds of matters at all .
wsj_1161	0	The following were among yesterday 's offerings and pricings in the U.S. and non-U.S. capital markets , with terms and syndicate manager , as compiled by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report :
wsj_1161	1	Exxon Capital Corp. -- $ 200 million of 8 1/4 % notes due Nov. 1 , 1999 , priced at 99.60 to yield 8.31 % .

wsj_1161	3	Rated triple-A by both Moody 's Investors Service Inc. and Standard & Poor 's Corp. , the issue will be sold through Salomon Brothers Inc .
wsj_1161	4	Citicorp -- $ 200 million of 8 3/4 % notes due Nov. 1 , 1996 , priced at 99.64 to yield 8.82 % .
wsj_1161	5	The noncallable issue was priced at a spread of 98 basis points above the Treasury 's seven-year note .

wsj_1164	0	During its centennial year , The Wall Street Journal will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of American business history .
wsj_1164	1	MORGAN STANLEY , THE ONCE STODGY investment house , in 1974 helped a corporate client complete a hostile takeover .
wsj_1164	2	It was the start of a boom in unfriendly , even ungentlemanly , mergers .
wsj_1164	3	On July 18 , 1974 , International Nickle of Canada -- advised by Morgan -- offered $ 28 a share , equal to $ 157 million , for ESB , a Philadelphia battery maker .
wsj_1164	4	ESB said it was given only a three-hour advance warning on a `` take it or leave it '' basis from Inco , as the Toronto company is called .
wsj_1164	5	`` ESB is aware that a hostile tender offer is being made by a foreign company for all of ESB 's shares , '' said F.J. Port , ESB 's president .
wsj_1164	6	`` Hostile '' thus entered the merger-acquisition lexicon .
wsj_1164	7	Joseph Flom , of Skadden , Arps , Slote , Meagher & Flom , which became a leading legal firm in merger cases , said the case `` made takeovers respectable . ''
wsj_1164	8	ESB spurned Inco and within five days ESB had a `` white knight '' as United Aircraft -- headed by Harry Gray , a shrewdly friendly acquirer of companies -- offered $ 34 a share .
wsj_1164	9	Gray was advised by Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch .
wsj_1164	10	ESB directors warmly accepted , but a whirlwind bidding match ensued .
wsj_1164	11	Within a few days in July , Inco raised its bid to $ 36 and United matched it .
wsj_1164	12	On a single day Inco lifted its offer to $ 38 and then to $ 41 , equal to $ 225.5 million .
wsj_1164	13	United met the $ 38 but then withdrew .
wsj_1164	14	ESB on July 29 accepted the Inco offer and the brief battle -- unlike the intricate and lengthy big takeovers of 1984-1989 -- was over .
wsj_1164	15	The new gritty game became a money maker for Wall Street 's once austere old-name houses .
wsj_1164	16	Inco paid Morgan an advisory fee of about $ 250,000 , a paltry figure by today 's measures .
wsj_1164	17	Early this year Morgan and three other investment houses each received $ 25 million in advisory fees from Kohlberg Kravis & Roberts in its $ 25 billion friendly buy-out of RJR Nabisco .
wsj_1165	0	HomeFed Corp. said third-quarter net income slid 14 % to $ 23.9 million , or $ 1.10 per fully diluted share , from $ 27.9 million , or $ 1.21 a fully diluted share , because of increased bad assets and unexpected trouble in unloading foreclosed property .
wsj_1165	1	The decline surprised analysts and jolted HomeFed 's stock , which lost 8.6 % of its value , closing at $ 38.50 on the New York Stock Exchange , down $ 3.625 .
wsj_1165	2	HomeFed had been one of the handful of large West Coast thrifts that in recent quarters had counteracted interest-rate problems dogging the industry by keeping a lid on problem assets and lending heavily into the furious California housing market .
wsj_1165	3	Analysts had been projecting fully diluted earnings in the third quarter in the range of about $ 1.30 a share .
wsj_1165	4	However , HomeFed 's loan originations and purchases plunged 26 % in the quarter , to $ 1.4 billion from $ 1.9 billion a year earlier .
wsj_1165	5	Meanwhile , non-performing assets rose to $ 593 million from $ 518.7 million .
wsj_1165	6	Some $ 380 million of the troubled assets is repossessed real estate , a 55.6 % surge from the $ 244.2 million of repossesed property HomeFed held a year ago .
wsj_1165	7	HomeFed has $ 17.9 billion of assets .
wsj_1165	8	HomeFed said most of the troubled assets are apartment complexes , shopping malls and other commercial real estate .
wsj_1165	9	It said about half are in California , with the rest scattered across the country .
wsj_1165	10	It said sales of such properties were slower than anticipated in the third quarter , but it expects sales to pick up in the rest of the year .
wsj_1165	11	HomeFed said the slide in loan originations was more a matter of design than a sign of cooling in the California market .
wsj_1165	12	Any such downturn in California would be grim news for West Coast thrifts , particularly the less healthy ones , which have performed poorly even with a torrid market .
wsj_1165	13	But HomeFed said it purposely curbed loan originations in the quarter because of uncertainty over the new capital requirements and regulations that will emerge from negotiations over implementing the government 's massive thrift bailout bill .
wsj_1165	14	It said its real-estate operations earned a record $ 21.7 million , more than double year-earlier real estate profit of $ 9 million .
wsj_1165	15	And analysts said they see no signs of an imminent swoon in California real estate , even with last week 's earthquake .
wsj_1165	16	The thrift said earnings also were nicked in the quarter by a $ 4 million provision for losses associated with its previously reported plan to liquidate a real-estate franchise network .
wsj_1165	17	For the nine months , HomeFed earned $ 82.5 million , or $ 3.52 a fully diluted share , a 4.3 % increase from year-earlier net income of $ 79.1 million , or $ 3.43 a fully diluted share .
wsj_1166	0	Yields on certificates of deposit at major banks were little changed in the latest week .
wsj_1166	1	The average yield on six-month CDs of $ 50,000 and less slipped to 7.96 % from 8.00 % , according to Banxquote Money Markets , an information service based here .
wsj_1166	2	On one-year CDs of $ 50,000 and less , the average slid to 8.02 % from 8.06 % .
wsj_1166	3	Both issues are among the most popular with individual investors .
wsj_1166	4	`` Because of shrinkage in the economy , rates can be expected to decline over a one-year horizon , '' said Norberto Mehl , chairman of Banxquote .
wsj_1166	5	`` It 's unclear how much rates can fall and how soon . ''
wsj_1166	6	Changes in CD yields in the week ended Tuesday were in line with blips up and down within a fairly narrow range for the last two months .
wsj_1166	7	Interest rates generally began declining last spring after moving steadily upward for more than a year .
wsj_1166	8	The average yield on small-denomination three-month CDs moved up two-hundredths of a percentage point in the latest week to 7.85 % .
wsj_1166	9	Long-term CDs declined just a fraction .
wsj_1166	10	The average yield on both two-year CDs and five-year CDs was 7.98 % .
wsj_1166	11	Only CDs sold by major brokerage firms posted significant increases in average yields in the latest week , reflecting increased yields on Treasury bills sold at Monday 's auction .
wsj_1166	12	The average yield on six-month broker-sold CDs rose to 8.29 % from 8.05 % and on one-year CDs the average yield rose to 8.30 % from 8.09 % .
wsj_1166	13	The brokerage firms , which negotiate rates with the banks and thrifts whose CDs they sell , generally feel they have to offer clients more than they can get on T-bills or from banks and thrifts directly .
wsj_1166	14	T-bills sold at Monday 's auction yielded 7.90 % for six months and 7.77 % for three months , up from 7.82 % and 7.61 % , respectively , the week before .
wsj_1166	15	So-called jumbo CDs , typically in denominations of $ 90,000 and up , also usually follow T-bills and interest rate trends in general more than those aimed at small investors .
wsj_1166	16	Some jumbos posted fractional changes in average yields this week , both up and down .
wsj_1166	17	The average yield on threemonth jumbos rose to 8.00 % from 7.96 % , while the two-year average fell by the same amount to 7.89 % .
wsj_1166	18	Six-month and oneyear yields were unchanged , on average .
wsj_1166	19	`` The CD market is unsettled right now , '' said Banxquote 's Mr. Mehl .
wsj_1166	20	`` It 's very easily influenced by changes in the stock market and the junk bond market . ''
wsj_1166	21	The small changes in averages reflect generally unchanged yields at many major banks .
wsj_1166	22	Some , however , lowered yields significantly .
wsj_1166	23	At Chase Manhattan Bank in New York , for example , the yield on a small denomination six-month CD fell about a quarter of a percentage point to 8.06 % .
wsj_1166	24	In California , Bank of America dropped the yield on both six-month and one-year `` savings '' CDs to 8.33 % from 8.61 % .
wsj_1166	25	Yields on money-market deposits were unchanged at an average 6.96 % for $ 50,000 and less and down just a hundredth of a percentage point to 7.41 % for jumbo deposits .
wsj_1167	0	Lion Nathan Ltd. agreed to buy the franchise to bottle , distribute and market Pepsi-Cola soft-drink products in Australia , the company said .
wsj_1167	1	The New Zealand brewing and retail concern did n't disclose terms .
wsj_1167	2	The agreement is effective Jan. 1 and is subject to approval from Australia 's Foreign Investment Review Board .
wsj_1167	3	Cadbury Schweppes Australia Ltd. has held the Australian Pepsi franchise for the past four years .
wsj_1167	4	Lion Nathan and PepsiCola Australia , a unit of PepsiCo Inc. of the U.S. , did n't say why Cadbury Schweppes will no longer hold the franchise .
wsj_1168	0	Wang Laboratories Inc. has sold $ 25 million of assets and reached agreements in principle to sell an additional $ 187 million shortly , Richard Miller , president , said at the annual meeting .
wsj_1168	1	He said Wang had reached an agreement with a `` major financial firm '' to sell for $ 150 million its domestic equipment lease portfolio and that of its Wang Credit Corp. subsidiary .
wsj_1168	2	He said it also agreed to sell a portion of its European real estate unit for $ 37 million .
wsj_1168	3	Mr. Miller said that Wang has already sold some $ 12 million of miscellaneous assets and disclosed that it had received $ 13 million from Compaq Computer Corp. , Houston , in the previously announced sale of its Stirling , Scotland , plant .
wsj_1168	4	Mr. Miller repeated that in the next six months he plans to sell another $ 200 million to $ 300 million of assets to repay debt and reduce interest costs at Wang , a minincomputer maker in Lowell , Mass .
wsj_1168	5	In response to questions after the annual meeting , Mr. Miller said the company is no longer looking for an equity investor .
wsj_1168	6	During the summer , Wang executives had said they might seek outside investment .
wsj_1169	0	Murata Mfg. Co. said it is establishing a subsidiary in Britain to produce electric parts , including ceramic condensers .
wsj_1169	1	The Tokyo maker of ceramic capacitors said it purchased a plant in Plymouth .
wsj_1169	2	The company did n't disclose a purchase price or capitalization figures .
wsj_1169	3	Murata said , however , it will invest about 1.4 billion yen $ 9.9 million in the new company .
wsj_1169	4	Production is slated to begin in April .
wsj_1169	5	The company , which has a European foothold , Murata Europe Management G.m.b . H. in Germany , said the latest venture is designed to meet demand for electric parts in European Community countries ahead of the creation of the unified market by the end of 1992 .
wsj_1169	6	Murata expects sales at the unit of about 1.5 billion yen in the first year .
wsj_1170	0	Safeway Stores Inc. reported a 69 % decline in profit for the fiscal third quarter , but said operating improvements were masked by unusual gains in the year-earlier period .
wsj_1170	1	The Oakland grocery retailer , closely held since a $ 4.2 billion leveraged buy-out in 1986 , said profit for the three months ended Sept. 9 was $ 7.1 million , compared with $ 23 million a year earlier .
wsj_1170	2	But it said the year-earlier results included gains of $ 23.5 million from divestitures .
wsj_1170	3	Sales rose 4.2 % to $ 3.31 billion from $ 3.2 billion .
wsj_1170	4	For the nine months , the company said profit fell 49 % to $ 23.5 million from $ 46 million in the year-earlier quarter , which included divestiture-related gains of $ 50.6 million .
wsj_1170	5	Sales increased 5.5 % to $ 9.81 billion from $ 9.3 billion .
wsj_1171	0	Benjamin Jacobson & Sons has been the New York Stock Exchange specialist firm in charge of trading stock in UAL Corp. and its predecessors since the early 1930s .
wsj_1171	1	But the firm has never had a day like yesterday .
wsj_1171	2	At first UAL did n't open because of an order imbalance .
wsj_1171	3	When it did a half-hour into the session , it was priced at $ 150 a share , down more than $ 28 from Monday 's close .
wsj_1171	4	It sank further to as low as $ 145 , but a big rally developed in the last half hour , pushing the stock back up to close at $ 170 , down just $ 8.375 from Monday .
wsj_1171	5	In the process , 4.9 million shares traded , making UAL the second most active issue on the Big Board .
wsj_1171	6	Munching pizza when they could and yelling until their voices gave out , the two Benjamin Jacobson specialists at the Big Board 's UAL trading post yesterday presided over what can only be described as a financial free-for-all .
wsj_1171	7	`` It was chaotic .
wsj_1171	8	But we like to call it ` controlled chaos , ' '' said 47-year-old Robert J. Jacobson Jr. , grandson of the firm 's founder .
wsj_1171	9	He manned the UAL post yesterday with Christopher Bates , 33 , an energetic Long Islander who 's a dead ringer for actor Nicolas Cage .
wsj_1171	10	Who was doing all the selling ?
wsj_1171	11	`` Options traders , arbitrage traders -- everyone , '' said Mr. Bates , cooling down with a carton of apple juice after the close yesterday .
wsj_1171	12	Added Mr. Jacobson , `` There were some pretty bad losses in the stock . ''
wsj_1171	13	Big Board traders said a 200,000-share buy order at $ 150 a share entered by Bear , Stearns & Co. , which was active in UAL stock all day , is what set off the UAL crowd in the late afternoon .
wsj_1171	14	A subsequent rally in UAL helped the staggering stock market stage an astonishing recovery from an 80-point deficit to finish only slightly below Monday 's close .
wsj_1171	15	Both Jacobson traders , who had been hoping UAL trading would get back to normal , read the news about the unraveling of UAL takeover plans on the train into work yesterday morning .
wsj_1171	16	The news told them it would be a while longer before UAL resumed trading like a regular airline stock after months of gyrations .
wsj_1171	17	When Mr. Jacobson walked into the office at 7:30 a.m. EDT , he announced : `` OK , buckle up . ''
wsj_1171	18	Messrs. Jacobson and Bates walked on the Big Board floor at about 8:45 a.m. yesterday and immediately spotted trouble .
wsj_1171	19	Already entered in the Big Board 's computers and transmitted to their post were sell orders for 65,000 UAL shares .
wsj_1171	20	The UAL news had already caused a selling furor in the so-called third market , in which firms buy and sell stock away from the exchange floor .
wsj_1171	21	UAL , which closed on the Big Board Monday at $ 178.375 a share , traded in the third market afterward as low as $ 158 a share .
wsj_1171	22	There were rumors of $ 148-a-share trades .
wsj_1171	23	In the 45 minutes before the 9:30 opening bell , the Jacobson specialists kept getting sell orders , heavier than they imagined .
wsj_1171	24	And at 9:15 , they posted a $ 135 to $ 155 `` first indication , '' or the price range in which the stock would probably open .
wsj_1171	25	That range was quickly narrowed to $ 145 to $ 155 , although traders surrounding the post were told that $ 148 to $ 150 would be the likely target .
wsj_1171	26	When UAL finally opened a half hour late , some 400,000 shares traded at $ 150 .
wsj_1171	27	There was `` selling pressure from everyone , '' said one trader .
wsj_1171	28	This month 's Friday-the-13th market plunge spurred by UAL news was n't as bad for the Jacobson specialists as yesterday 's action .
wsj_1171	29	On that earlier day , the stock 's trading was halted at a critical time so the specialists could catch their breath .
wsj_1171	30	Mr. Jacobson , his gray hair flying , did n't wear out his red-white-and-blue sneakers , but he sweat so much he considered sending out for a new shirt .
wsj_1171	31	Mr. Bates usually handles day-to-day UAL trading on his own .
wsj_1171	32	But yesterday , the heavy trading action eventually consumed not only Messrs. Jacobson and Bates but four other Jacobson partners , all doing their specialist-firm job of tugging buyers and sellers together and adjusting prices to accommodate the market .
wsj_1171	33	About 30 floor traders crammed near the UAL post most of the day , and probably hundreds more came and went -- a `` seething mass , '' as one trader described it .
wsj_1171	34	The 4.9 million-share volume flowing through the Jacobson specialist operation was about five times normal for the stock .
wsj_1171	35	The heavy buying in the last half hour led the specialists to take special steps .
wsj_1171	36	The Bear Stearns order that marked the late-day turnaround caused a `` massive buying effort '' as UAL jumped $ 20 a share to $ 170 in the last half hour , said Mr. Bates .
wsj_1171	37	With 15 seconds of trading to go , Mr. Jacobson , with what voice he had left , announced to the trading mob : `` We 're going to trade one price on the bell . ''
wsj_1171	38	That meant no trading would occur in the final seconds , as a way of making sure that last-second orders are n't subjected to a sudden price swing that would upset customers .
wsj_1171	39	About 11,000 shares sold at $ 170 on the bell , representing about eight to 10 late orders , the specialists estimate .
wsj_1171	40	Big Board traders praised the Jacobson specialists for getting through yesterday without a trading halt .
wsj_1171	41	In Chicago , a UAL spokesman , `` by way of policy , '' declined to comment on the company 's stock or the specialists ' performance .
wsj_1171	42	Leaving the exchange at about 5 p.m. , the Jacobson specialists made no predictions about how trading might go today .
wsj_1171	43	Said Earl Ellis , a Jacobson partner who got involved in the UAL action , `` It all starts all over again '' today .
wsj_1173	0	Vickers PLC , a British aerospace , defense and automotive conglomerate , said it reached an agreed cash bid of # 108.2 million $ 173.3 million for Ross Catherall Group PLC , a maker of specialty alloy and ceramics .
wsj_1173	1	The company said it expects to receive acceptances for its offer of 253 pence $ 4.05 per share representing at least 67 % of Ross Catherall 's issued share capital , or 12.7 million ordinary shares .
wsj_1173	2	Vickers said its offer also includes an option to receive a redeemable loan note in lieu of cash .
wsj_1173	3	The notes can be redeemed starting in July 1991 .
wsj_1173	4	The company said its acquisition of Ross Catherall will be covered largely by cash raised in its July disposal of Howson-Algraphy for # 241.7 million .
wsj_1175	0	BUELL INDUSTRIES Inc. halved its quarterly dividend to five cents a share , payable Nov. 17 to stock of record Nov. 3 .

wsj_1176	0	Dunkin ' Donuts Inc. , battling a takeover proposal by Canada 's DD Acquisition Corp. , said that its directors will evaluate takeover offers submitted by Nov. 10 .
wsj_1176	1	Dunkin ' Donuts , based in Randolph , Mass. , previously said it would explore `` alternatives , '' including a leveraged buy-out of the company , but had n't set a date for submission of proposals .
wsj_1176	2	Dunkin ' Donuts Chairman and Chief Executive Robert M. Rosenberg said `` a sale is one alternative being considered , '' but he added the board has n't decided whether to sell the doughnut franchiser .
wsj_1176	3	DD Acquisition , jointly owned by Unicorp Canada Corp. 's Kingsbridge Capital Group unit and Cara Operations Ltd. , has made a $ 45-a-share tender offer valued at $ 268 million for Dunkin ' Donuts .
wsj_1176	4	Dunkin ' Donuts ' announcement followed DD Acquisition 's request to the Delaware Court of Chancery Monday to set a trial date for its suit against the company .
wsj_1176	5	The trial had been postponed to allow Dunkin ' Donuts to seek alternatives to DD Acquisition 's offer .
wsj_1177	0	Combustion Engineering Inc. said third-quarter net income of $ 22.8 million , reversing a $ 91.7 million year-earlier loss .
wsj_1177	1	The Stamford , Conn. , power-generation products and services company said per-share earnings were 56 cents compared with the year-ago loss of $ 2.39 .
wsj_1177	2	Sales fell 1.5 % to $ 884 million from $ 897.2 million .
wsj_1177	3	Strong profit in the process industries , including chemical and pulp and paper , were offset by higher interest expense and by lower earnings as the company closed out certain long-term contracts .
wsj_1177	4	Combustion reported improved profits in its automation and control products businesses , and it narrowed its losses in its public sector and environmental segment .
wsj_1177	5	Power generation had higher sales but lower earnings ; the company cited factors including work on certain low profit-margin contracts from previous years .
wsj_1177	6	Net in the latest quarter included a pretax gain of $ 22.4 million from the sale of Combustion 's minority interest in Stein Industrie to GEC Alsthom N.V. of the Netherlands .
wsj_1177	7	Last year 's results reflected a gain of $ 28.2 million on disposition of assets and a $ 165 million pretax provision mainly from costs of completing certain waste-to-energy and other power plants .
wsj_1179	0	Honeywell Inc. , Minneapolis , said it completed its previously announced sale of 16 % of the shares outstanding in its Japanese joint venture , Yamatake-Honeywell , for $ 280 million .
wsj_1179	1	The stake was acquired by a group of 10 Japanese financial institutions and industrial corporations , primarily insurance companies , Honeywell said .
wsj_1179	2	Proceeds will be used to repurchase as many as 10 million shares of Honeywell stock , as previously announced .
wsj_1179	3	Honeywell said a second sale of Yamatake-Honeywell is still being negotiated .
wsj_1179	4	The company , which now holds a 34 % stake in the venture , has indicated that it intends to retain at least a 20 % stake long term .
wsj_1179	5	A 20 % stake would allow Honeywell to include Yamatake earnings in its results .
wsj_1179	6	A company spokesman said the gain on the sale could n't be estimated until the `` tax treatment has been determined .

wsj_1181	0	Bank of Montreal said it added 850 million Canadian dollars US$ 725.8 million to its reserves against losses on Third World loans , bringing the total it has set aside this year to C$ 1 billion .
wsj_1181	1	The bank said the C$ 1 billion in reserves will result in a charge of C$ 595 million against earnings but said it still expects to report a profit for the year ending Tuesday .
wsj_1181	2	The bank reported net income of C$ 389 million for the nine months ended July 31 .

wsj_1184	0	General Electric Co. executives and lawyers provided `` misleading and false '' information to the Pentagon in 1985 in an effort to cover up `` longstanding fraudulent '' billing practices , federal prosecutors alleged in legal briefs .
wsj_1184	1	The government 's startling allegations , filed only days before the scheduled start of a criminal overcharge trial against GE in Philadelphia federal district court , challenge the motives and veracity of the nation 's third-largest defense contractor .
wsj_1184	2	In a strongly worded response summarizing a filing made in the same court yesterday , GE asserted that `` prosecutors have misstated the testimony of witnesses , distorted documents and ignored important facts . ''
wsj_1184	3	The company attacked the government 's allegations as `` reckless and baseless mudslinging , '' and said its management `` promptly and accurately reported '' to the Pentagon all relevant information about billing practices .
wsj_1184	4	The case strikes at the corporate image of GE , which provides the military with everything from jet engines and electronic warfare equipment to highly classified design work on the Strategic Defense Initiative , and could cause a loss of future defense contracts if Pentagon and Justice Department officials take a tough stance .
wsj_1184	5	The company has been considered an industry leader in advocating cooperation and voluntary disclosures of improper or inflated billing practices .
wsj_1184	6	But the government now claims that a group of company managers and lawyers engaged in an elaborate strategy over five years to obscure from federal authorities the extent and details of `` widespread '' fraudulent billing practices .
wsj_1184	7	The problems were uncovered during a series of internal investigations of the company 's Space Systems division , which has been the focus of two separate overcharge prosecutions by the government since 1985 .
wsj_1184	8	The dispute stems from pretrial maneuvering in the pending court case , in which prosecutors have been demanding access to a host of internal company memos , reports and documents .
wsj_1184	9	Last November , a federal grand jury indicted GE on charges of fraud and false claims in connection with an alleged scheme to defraud the Army of $ 21 million on a logistics computer contract .
wsj_1184	10	The company , for its part , maintains that many of the disputed documents are privileged attorney-client communications that should n't be turned over to prosecutors .
wsj_1184	11	A hearing is scheduled on the issue today .
wsj_1184	12	The government 's 136-page filing covers events leading up to the current case and an earlier indictment in March 1985 , when GE was accused of defrauding the Pentagon by illegally claiming cost overruns on Minuteman missile contracts .
wsj_1184	13	GE pleaded guilty and paid a fine of more than $ 1 million in the Minuteman case , which involved some of the same individuals and operations that are at the center of the dispute in the Philadelphia court .
wsj_1184	14	In order to show that all of its units had corrected billing problems and therefore should become eligible again for new contracts , prosecutors contend that `` high-level GE executives '' and company lawyers provided `` misleading statements '' to then-Air Force Secretary Verne Orr and other Pentagon officials during a series of meetings in 1985 .
wsj_1184	15	Overall , the government contends that GE 's disclosure efforts largely were intended to `` curry favor '' with Pentagon officials without detailing the extent of the management lapses and allegedly pervasive billing irregularities uncovered by company investigations .
wsj_1184	16	Prosecutors depict a company that allegedly sat on damaging evidence of overcharges from 1983 to 1985 , despite warnings from an internal auditor .
wsj_1184	17	When GE finally disclosed the problems , prosecutors contend that Mr. Orr `` was erroneously informed that the suspected practices had only just been discovered '' by GE management .
wsj_1184	18	In its brief , the government asserted that it needs the internal GE documents to rebut anticipated efforts by GE during the trial to demonstrate `` its good corporate character . ''
wsj_1184	19	GE , which was surprised by the last-minute subpoena for more than 100 boxes and file cabinets of documents , countered that senior GE managers did n't find out about questionable billing practices until 1985 , and that the information was passed on quickly to Mr. Orr at his first meeting with company representatives .
wsj_1184	20	Subsequent meetings , initiated after the company and two of its units were briefly suspended from federal contracts , were held to familiarize Mr. Orr with the company 's self-policing procedures and to disclose additional information , according to GE .
wsj_1184	21	GE 's filing contends that the billing practices at the heart of the current controversy involved technical disputes rather than criminal activity .
wsj_1184	22	The company 's conduct `` does not even raise a question of wrongful corporate intent , ratification or cover-up , '' GE 's brief asserts .
wsj_1184	23	`` On the contrary , it shows a corporation reacting swiftly and aggressively to very difficult issues in largely uncharted waters . ''
wsj_1184	24	Mr. Orr could n't be reached for comment yesterday .
wsj_1185	0	Applied Solar Energy Corp. of City of Industry , Calif. , said it and its majority shareholder , American Cyanamid Co. , signed a non-binding letter of intent for the acquisition of Applied Solar by McDonnell Douglas Corp. for about $ 38 million .
wsj_1185	1	The proposed acquisition provides for a cash payment of $ 10 a share at closing and a contingent payment of as much as 80 cents a share placed in escrow .
wsj_1185	2	Details of the escrow agreement have n't been completed , the companies said .
wsj_1185	3	There are 3.5 million shares of Applied Solar , of which American Cyanamid owns 2.7 million .
wsj_1185	4	American Cyanamid is a Wayne , N.J. , chemicals , drugs and fertilizer concern .
wsj_1185	5	Completion of the acquisition is subject to execution of a definitive agreement , approval by all three companies ' boards and the approval of Applied Solar 's shareholders .
wsj_1185	6	An Applied Solar spokesman said completion is expected at the end of the year or early next year .
wsj_1185	7	A spokeswoman for the St. Louis aerospace and defense concern said it wanted the acquistion because Applied Solar is involved in solar cells and solid-state laser components , and this fits with McDonnell 's business of laser applications for military space .
wsj_1186	0	Trading in Cineplex Odeon Corp. shares was halted on the New York and Toronto stock exchanges late yesterday afternoon at the company 's request , Toronto Stock Exchange officials said .
wsj_1186	1	Brian Hemming , a spokesman for the company 's committee of independent directors , established in May to solicit and evaluate offers for the company , said it was expected to make an announcement early this morning .
wsj_1186	2	But Mr. Hemming said he was n't aware of the nature of the talks under way between committee members and their advisers .
wsj_1186	3	Cineplex traded on the New York Stock Exchange at $ 11.25 a share , up $ 1.125 , before trading was halted .
wsj_1186	4	Analysts have speculated in recent days that the value of offers received by the committee fell well short of what they had hoped , or even that the company 's chairman , president and chief executive officer , Garth Drabinsky , is the only bidder for the company as a whole .
wsj_1186	5	The current effort to auction off the company was triggered by a dispute between Mr. Drabinsky and the Toronto-based movie chain 's major shareholder , MCA Inc .
wsj_1188	0	Directors of Bergen Bank and Den Norske Creditbank , two of Norway 's leading banks , announced they had agreed to the formal merger of the banks .
wsj_1188	1	The merger would create Scandinavia 's seventh largest bank , with combined assets of 210 billion Norwegian kroner $ 30.3 billion .
wsj_1188	2	The banks said an application for a concession to merge into one entity to be called Den Norske Bank AS was sent Monday to the Finance Ministry .
wsj_1188	3	The two boards said in a joint statement that the proposed merger agreement was considered in separate board meetings in Oslo Monday .
wsj_1188	4	They said the agreement will be submitted to their respective supervisory boards next Wednesday .
wsj_1188	5	Extraordinary general meetings , to be held Nov. 28 , will decide the share exchange ratio .
wsj_1188	6	The merger requires the approval of Norwegian authorities .
wsj_1190	0	Time Warner Inc. is considering a legal challenge to Tele-Communications Inc. 's plan to buy half of Showtime Networks Inc. , a move that could lead to all-out war between the cable industry 's two most powerful players .
wsj_1190	1	Time is also fighting the transaction on other fronts , by attempting to discourage other cable operators from joining Tele-Communications as investors in Showtime , cable-TV industry executives say .
wsj_1190	2	Time officials declined to comment .
wsj_1190	3	Last week , Tele-Communications agreed to pay Viacom Inc. $ 225 million for a 50 % stake in its Showtime subsidiary , which is a distant second to Time 's Home Box Office in the delivery of pay-TV networks to cable subscribers .
wsj_1190	4	Tele-Communications , the U.S. 's largest cable company , said it may seek other cable partners to join in its investment .
wsj_1190	5	Tele-Communications is HBO 's largest customer , and the two have a number of other business relationships .
wsj_1190	6	Earlier this year , Time even discussed bringing Tele-Communications in as an investor in HBO , executives at both companies said .
wsj_1190	7	The purchase of the Showtime stake is `` a direct slap in our face , '' said one senior Time executive .
wsj_1190	8	Time is expected to mount a legal challenge in U.S. District Court in New York , where Viacom in May filed a $ 2.5 billion antitrust suit charging Time and HBO with monopolizing the pay-TV business and trying to crush competition from Showtime .
wsj_1190	9	Executives involved in plotting Time 's defense say it is now preparing a countersuit naming both Viacom and Tele-Communications as defendants .
wsj_1190	10	The executives say Time may seek to break up the transaction after it is consummated , or may seek constraints that would prevent Tele-Communications from dropping HBO in any of its cable systems in favor of Showtime .
wsj_1190	11	Viacom officials declined to comment .
wsj_1190	12	Jerome Kern , Tele-Communications ' chief outside counsel , said he was n't aware of Time 's legal plans .
wsj_1190	13	But he said that any effort by Time to characterize the Tele-Communications investment in Showtime as anti-competitive would be `` the pot calling the kettle black . ''
wsj_1190	14	`` It 's hard to see how an investment by the largest cable operator ) in the weaker of the two networks is anti-competitive , when the stronger of the two networks is owned by the second largest '' cable operator , Mr. Kern said .
wsj_1190	15	In addition to owning HBO , with 22 million subscribers , Time Warner separately operates cable-TV system serving about 5.6 million cable-TV subscribers .
wsj_1190	16	Tele-Communications controls close to 12 million cable subscribers , and Viacom has about one million .
wsj_1190	17	In its suit against Time , Viacom says the ownership of both cable systems and cable-programming networks gives the company too much market power .
wsj_1190	18	Time argues that in joining up with Tele-Communications , Viacom has potentially more power , particularly since Viacom also owns cable networks MTV , VH-1 and Nick at Nite .
wsj_1190	19	Ironically , Tele-Communications and Time have often worked closely in the cable business .
wsj_1190	20	Together , they control nearly 40 % of Turner Broadcasting Systems Inc. ; Tele-Communications has a 21.8 % stake , while Time Warner has a 17.8 % stake .
wsj_1190	21	But since Time 's merger with Warner Communications Inc. , relations between the two have become strained .
wsj_1190	22	Each company worries that the other is becoming too powerful and too vertically integrated .
wsj_1190	23	Meanwhile , some legal observers say the Tele-Communications investment and other developments are weakening Viacom 's antitrust suit against Time .
wsj_1190	24	Viacom accuses Time in its suit of refusing to carry Showtime or a sister service , The Movie Channel , on Time 's Manhattan Cable TV system , one of the nation 's largest urban systems .
wsj_1190	25	But yesterday , Manhattan Cable announced it will launch Showtime on Nov. 1 to over 230,000 subscribers .
wsj_1190	26	Showtime has also accused HBO of locking up the lion 's share of Hollywood 's movies by signing exclusive contracts with all the major studios .
wsj_1190	27	But Showtime has continued to sign new contracts with Hollywood studios , and yesterday announced it will buy movies from Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. , which currently has a non-exclusive arrangement with HBO .
wsj_1191	0	The Federal Trade Commission said it authorized its staff to seek a preliminary injunction barring Imo Industries Inc. from acquiring the shares outstanding of the U.S. unit of the British company , United Scientific Holdings PLC , for $ 69 million .
wsj_1191	1	The FTC said it `` had reason to believe that the proposed acquisition could substantially reduce competition '' in the production of certain image intensifier tubes , which are important components of night-vision devices sold primarily to the defense industry .
wsj_1191	2	The FTC said it would seek to enjoin the proposed acquisition in a federal trial court , but declined to specify which one .
wsj_1191	3	Under federal law , if the court grants a preliminary injunction , the FTC must begin administrative proceedings to determine the legality of the proposed stock purchase within 20 days .
wsj_1191	4	Officials at the United Scientific unit , Optic-Electronic Corp. of Garland , Texas , and at Imo Industries of Lawrenceville , N.J. , could n't be reached for comment .
wsj_1194	0	International Business Machines Corp. agreed to acquire a 15 % stake in Paxus Corp. , an Australian computer-software and information-services concern , for 20 million Australian dollars US$ 17 million .
wsj_1194	1	The investment will be made through IBM Australia Ltd. , a unit of IBM , the two companies said yesterday .
wsj_1194	2	IBM can raise its stake in Paxus to 20 % over three years , but agreed to not go beyond 20 % in that time .
wsj_1194	3	Paxus said in a statement it has several `` well developed product and services relationships '' with the U.S. computer company , and plans to expand these links .
wsj_1194	4	The company earns about half its revenue overseas and plans further expansion .
wsj_1194	5	A majority stake in Paxus currently held by NZI Corp. will be diluted to slightly less than 50 % after IBM acquires its interest .
wsj_1194	6	The agreement requires approval from Australia 's Foreign Investment Review Board and National Companies and Securities Commission , and from shareholders of Paxus .
wsj_1195	0	Bond Corp . Holdings Ltd. 's consolidated debt totals 6.9 billion Australian dollars US$ 5.32 billion , including A$ 1.6 billion of bonds convertible into shares .
wsj_1195	1	Alan Bond , chairman and controlling shareholder of the cash-strapped Australian media , brewing , resources and property concern , disclosed the debt figures yesterday .
wsj_1195	2	The disclosure follows last Friday 's news that Bond Corp. incurred an overall loss of A$ 980.2 million for the fiscal year ended June 30 , the largest loss in Australian corporate history .
wsj_1195	3	The debt load would have been higher but for a reduction of A$ 5 billion over the past year from asset sales , Mr. Bond said at a business gathering .
wsj_1195	4	Mr. Bond indicated the consolidated debt figures , which include debt of units such as Bell Group Ltd. , will be published soon in Bond Corp. 's 1989 annual accounts .
wsj_1195	5	He predicted the debt will be reduced by another A$ 3.8 billion this fiscal year ending June 30 , 1990 , but did n't explain how this will be achieved .
wsj_1195	6	Mr. Bond blamed rising Australian interest rates and the acquisition of Bell Group `` with its very high levels of shortterm debt '' for producing a condition `` that was no longer sustainable .
wsj_1195	7	`` In order to restore confidence and ensure the support of our principal lenders , '' Mr. Bond said , `` we embarked on fundamantal changes in the structure and direction of the group . ''
wsj_1195	8	That reassessment resulted in continuing asset sales , as well as write-offs exceeding A$ 1.1 billion last fiscal year .
wsj_1195	9	`` In essence we have made a decision to clear the decks , '' Mr. Bond told the meeting .
wsj_1195	10	While some assets have been written down , others are undervalued in the accounts , Mr. Bond maintained .
wsj_1195	11	Among these are the company 's Australian brewing assets , in the books at A$ 950 million but actually worth A$ 2.5 billion , he said .
wsj_1195	12	An investment in Chile 's telephone company is carried at US$ 300 million but really worth US$ 500 million , and the company 's property portfolio is undervalued by at least A$ 250 million , Mr. Bond said .
wsj_1195	13	Mr. Bond forecast that by next June , `` what will emerge will be a company with a honed sense of purpose ... a stable balance sheet , with good-quality assets in brewing , telecommunications , media and property . ''
wsj_1195	14	He did n't name energy resources in that list , signaling that all the company 's coal and oil interests might be for sale in total or in part .
wsj_1195	15	Some of the oil interests already have been sold .
wsj_1196	0	Mercedes-Benz of North America Inc. , Grosse Pointe Shores , Mich. , estimated it will sell about as many cars in 1990 as the 75,000 it expects to deliver this year .
wsj_1196	1	Mercedes officials said they expect flat sales next year even though they see the U.S. luxury-car market expanding slightly .
wsj_1196	2	Erich Krampe , president of the U.S. sales arm of West German auto maker Daimler Benz AG , predicted luxury-car sales will rise to 840,000 in 1990 from 830,000 this year primarily because of the new Japanese makes .
wsj_1196	3	Most of the growth , he said , will come in the $ 35,000-to-$50,000 price range , where Mercedes has a 35 % U.S. market share .
wsj_1196	4	Mercedes sold 82,348 cars in 1988 .
wsj_1196	5	Mr. Krampe also said that Mercedes plans to bring out new models every year through the mid-1990s and it will shorten its product development cycle to eight years from 10 or 12 years to compete more effectively with Toyota Motor Corp. 's Lexus , Nissan Motor Co. 's Infiniti and Honda Motor Co. 's Acura luxury-car divisions .
wsj_1197	0	Homestake Mining Co. , San Francisco , blamed the continued slump in gold prices for an 83 % plunge in third-quarter net income to $ 2 million , or two cents a share , from $ 11.2 million , or 12 cents a share , a year earlier .

wsj_1197	3	`` A significant increase in gold sales to 248,279 ounces for the quarter from 188,726 in the third quarter of 1988 was more than offset by the continued decline in average gold price realization to $ 367 from $ 429 per ounce , '' the company said .
wsj_1197	4	For the nine months , the mining company posted a 40 % drop in profit to $ 30.1 million , or 31 cents a share , from $ 50.6 million , or 52 cents a share , on a 6 % rise in revenue to $ 323.2 million from $ 305.7 million .

wsj_1199	0	Apogee Enterprises Inc. said profit for the third quarter ending Dec. 2 will fall below the year-earlier results because of an after-tax charge of $ 1.9 million related to a project that was guaranteed by the company .
wsj_1199	1	A year ago , the Minneapolis glass products and aluminum window maker earned $ 4 million , or 30 cents a share , on revenue of $ 114 million .
wsj_1199	2	Apogee said the charge stems from a building supply contract in which the company guaranteed a contractor 's performance .
wsj_1199	3	Apogee said a subcontractor had severe cost overruns and was unable to fulfill the contract terms on its own , making it necessary for Apogee to advance cash to ensure completion of the project .

wsj_1202	3	Stronger results from the company 's broadcast and cable television units and professional and textbook publishing divisions , plus increased advertising at the company 's largest newspaper , the Los Angeles Times , offset advertising declines in the company 's newspapers in the Eastern U.S. , the company said .

wsj_1205	1	The agreement also calls for General Electric Pension , a unit of General Electric Co. , to receive as much as 10 % of Color Systems ' fully diluted common stock , depending on the proceeds from the sale of the AEI Film Library and its receivables .
wsj_1205	2	General Electric Pension took control of the 85-title library last month after Color Systems defaulted on the loan .
wsj_1205	3	The agreement depends on Color Systems ' ability to win similar concessions from other creditors .
wsj_1205	4	Buddy Young , president , said the company expects to conclude negotiations with other creditors within 60 days .
wsj_1205	5	Color Systems , which converts black-and-white film to color videotape , posted a loss of $ 7.1 million , or $ 1.32 a share , on revenue of $ 10.6 million for the fiscal year ended June 30 .

wsj_1207	1	The maker of household products said the new dividend is payable Dec. 1 to shares of record Nov. 10 .
wsj_1207	2	Separately , the company 's board adopted a proposal to amend its 1986 shareholder rights plan , further insulating the company from takeover .
wsj_1207	3	Rubbermaid officials said they are n't aware of any effort to take over the company , but believed the shareholder plan needed to be strengthened .
wsj_1207	4	`` The board has stated repeatedly that Rubbermaid should be independent , '' said Walter W. Williams , Rubbermaid president .
wsj_1207	5	Some changes to the plan were minor adjustments , but the most significant was an amendment that provides that if any investor holds 25 % or more of Rubbermaid 's voting securities , each right held by others would entitle the holder to buy Rubbermaid shares with a market value of twice the right 's exercise price .
wsj_1207	6	Mr. Williams said the exercise price is $ 125 , meaning holders would have the right to buy $ 250 of Rubbermaid stock for half price , diluting the investor 's 25 % stake .
wsj_1207	7	For the third quarter , Rubbermaid earned $ 32.6 million , or 44 cents a share , up 16 % from $ 28.1 million , or 38 cents a share , a year earlier .

wsj_1210	0	Fireman 's Fund Corp. said third-quarter net income plunged 85 % to $ 7.2 million from last year 's $ 49.1 million , or 99 cents a share , because of ravages of Hurricane Hugo and increased reserves for legal expenses .

wsj_1210	8	Hurricane Hugo accounted for about $ 36 million in pretax third-quarter losses , net of reinsurance recoveries .
wsj_1210	9	The company said there was an additional increase in loss and loss-expense reserves of $ 71 million reflecting `` higher than expected '' development in claims legal expenses from to prior periods .
wsj_1210	10	For the third quarter , net premiums were $ 742 million , up 9.6 % from $ 677 million in last year 's quarter , because of the expiration of the National Indemnity quota share reinsurance agreement .
wsj_1210	11	Net premiums written through Sept. 30 fell 5 % to $ 2.1 billion from $ 2.2 billion a year ago , because of the writing of fewer policies at flat prices , the company said .
wsj_1210	12	Third-quarter and nine-month results do n't include any provision for premium returns that could be ordered by the California Department of Insurance under Proposition 103 .
wsj_1210	13	Fireman 's Fund said it has applied for an exemption from these rate rollbacks , and plans to defend its filing in hearings before the department .

wsj_1215	0	Staar Surgical Co. 's board said that it has removed Thomas R. Waggoner as president and chief executive officer and that John R. Wolf , formerly executive vice president , sales and marketing , has been named president and chief executive officer .
wsj_1215	1	Mr. Waggoner has been involved in a dispute with the board since August , when he ousted all the directors .

wsj_1219	0	The Justice Department said it filed a lawsuit seeking more than $ 7.7 million from a Meredith Corp. unit on charges that the company defrauded the government on a contract to provide relocation services for federal employees .
wsj_1219	1	The suit , filed in federal trial court in Des Moines , Iowa , where Meredith is based , alleges that the diversified media company 's relocation unit cheated the government by misrepresenting the value of government employees ' homes .
wsj_1219	2	The government contract required Meredith Relocation Corp. to purchase employees ' homes based on independent appraisals .
wsj_1219	3	The Justice Department alleges that the company `` engaged in various forms of misrepresentation '' with the goal of reducing the appraised value of employees ' homes .
wsj_1219	4	In the suit , the department seeks to recover $ 7.7 million in costs incurred when the government terminated its contract with Meredith Relocation and sought other contracts to replace it .

wsj_1219	6	Officials with Meredith did n't have any immediate comment on the suit .
wsj_1220	0	Lloyd 's of London said it plans to clamp down on the ability of underwriting syndicates to leave their annual accounts open beyond the customary three years .
wsj_1220	1	Underwriting syndicates at Lloyd 's , the world 's largest insurance market , generally do n't close their accounts for three years , to allow for the filing of claims and litigation .
wsj_1220	2	When such claims and litigation extend beyond the period , the syndicates can extend their accounting deadlines .
wsj_1220	3	Lloyd 's said there are currently 115 open account years involving 68 of the market 's roughly 360 syndicates .
wsj_1220	4	The open-year accounting practice `` is widely recognized within Lloyd 's as of serious concern '' to the 31,329 member investors , who underwrite insurance at Lloyd 's in return for premium and investment income , Lloyd 's said .
wsj_1220	5	The procedure causes `` great uncertainty '' because an investor ca n't be sure of his or her individual liability , Lloyd 's said .
wsj_1220	6	As a result , the insurance market plans new measures to restrict the ability of syndicate officials to leave years open .
wsj_1220	7	Lloyd 's said it expects to enact new rules mandating the changes by year end .
wsj_1220	8	Under the new rules , the officials will have to secure additional information and reports from actuaries , including an assessment of whether officials have acted reasonably .
wsj_1220	9	In addition , officials will have to get quotes for certain reinsurance contracts and obtain approvals from other syndicate directors .
wsj_1221	0	Computer Associates International Inc. reported earnings for the second quarter , ended Sept. 30 , plummeted 66 % , primarily because of the acquisition of Cullinet Software Inc .
wsj_1221	1	The nation 's largest software company earned $ 9.6 million , or five cents a share , compared with $ 28 million , or 16 cents a share , a year earlier .
wsj_1221	2	Revenue rose 5 % to $ 282 million from $ 268.3 million .
wsj_1221	3	The drop in earnings had been anticipated by most Wall Street analysts , but the results were reported after the market closed .
wsj_1221	4	Computer Associates closed at $ 13.625 , down 25 cents , in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange .
wsj_1221	5	Anthony Wang , president , attributed the drop to the disruption of the company 's business resulting from the prolonged process of acquiring Cullinet .
wsj_1221	6	The acquisition was completed in September .
wsj_1221	7	In August , the company warned investors that the acquisition was being delayed , and many customers were holding off on purchase decisions until the takeover was completed .
wsj_1221	8	The delays mainly affected sales of data base management products , a core area for both Computer Associates and Cullinet , as well as sales of other products as part of package sales .
wsj_1223	0	Euro Disneyland shares made a debut like Snow White yesterday while most of the London stock market looked like it had eaten the Evil Queen 's poisoned apple .
wsj_1223	1	In its first day of when-issued trading here , Euro Disney soared like Dumbo to close at 814 pence $ 13.05 , up 15 % from its 707-pence offering price .
wsj_1223	2	The overall London market , following Wall Street 's early nosedive , took a late beating .
wsj_1223	3	The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-Share Index plummeted 40.4 points to close at 2149.3 .
wsj_1223	4	Traders credited Euro Disney 's share performance to the tremendous hyping of the project that the shares are destined to help finance : Walt Disney Co. 's 4,800-acre theme park 20 miles east of Paris .
wsj_1223	5	The park is slated to open in 1992 .
wsj_1223	6	`` The issue was very well-received -- Disney is such a well-known , you can say world-wide , name , '' said Vernon Dempsey , head trader of European equities at Kleinwort Benson Ltd. , which is making a market in the issue .
wsj_1223	7	Mr. Dempsey estimated that the issue 's London debut was accompanied by `` very , very heavy turnover -- between five million and six million shares . ''
wsj_1223	8	Most of the buying was institutional , he added .
wsj_1223	9	Official trading in the shares will start in London , Paris and Brussels on Nov. 6 , when the French-franc denominated offering , valued at the equivalent of nearly $ 1 billion , comes to market in the European Community .
wsj_1223	10	U.S. investors will be permitted to buy the shares from EC investors 90 days later .
wsj_1223	11	Because of the interest connected with the issue , the London exchange took the unusual step of letting traders establish an officially sanctioned when-issued market .
wsj_1223	12	A volatile , unofficial `` gray '' market in the shares has been operating in Paris for about two weeks .
wsj_1223	13	In contrast to the London performance , Euro Disney there closed down three francs yesterday , at 79 1/2 francs $ 12.66 bid , but still about 10 % over the 72-franc offering price .
wsj_1223	14	`` A lot of people are getting hurt on this wicked whipsawing , '' cautioned Alistair Cuddeford , a London-based Salomon Brothers International Ltd. trader who makes a market in franc-denominated Euro Disney shares .
wsj_1223	15	`` There should be no great rush for investors to buy this .
wsj_1223	16	A lot of big European banks , mostly French , and Swiss arb accounts have been buying the stock just to flip it '' for a quick profit , he said .
wsj_1224	0	Albert Fried Jr. , a 59-year-old director and holder of a 9.5 % stake in the company , was named chairman of this maker of products for the construction equipment , material handling and railroad industries .
wsj_1224	1	He succeeds L.L. White Jr. , 62 , who resigned but continues as a director .
wsj_1224	2	Mr. Fried also is the managing partner of Albert Fried & Co .
wsj_1225	0	Ford Motor Co. intensified its battle with General Motors Corp. over Jaguar PLC by saying it is prepared to make a bid for all of the British auto maker when restrictions on its shareholding are lifted .
wsj_1225	1	The statement was part of a Ford filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission .
wsj_1225	2	Ford did n't say how much it might offer for Jaguar , or when .
wsj_1225	3	The British government currently forbids any outside investor from holding more than 15 % of the company 's shares without permission until Dec. 31 ,
wsj_1225	4	But with its stake in Jaguar , which it raised yesterday to 11.95 % , Ford could convene a special Jaguar shareholders ' meeting and urge holders to vote to drop the restriction sooner .
wsj_1225	5	A successful vote would put pressure on the British government to lift the restriction .
wsj_1225	6	`` We have not made that decision '' to seek a Jaguar special shareholders ' meeting , said Martyn Watkins , a Ford spokesman in London .
wsj_1225	7	He emphasized that the car maker only would bid for all of Jaguar under the right circumstances , and said `` those circumstances are n't right or possible at the moment . ''
wsj_1225	8	Last month , Ford announced plans to acquire as much as 15 % of Jaguar .
wsj_1225	9	Since then , Jaguar officials have confirmed that they are discussing an alliance with GM and said last week that they hoped to reach an agreement within a month .
wsj_1225	10	Analysts have been expecting a GM-Jaguar pact that would give the U.S. car maker an eventual 30 % stake in the British company and create joint ventures that would produce an executive-model range of cars .
wsj_1225	11	But the specter of Ford eventually launching a full-fledged bid could unravel the GM-Jaguar talks .
wsj_1225	12	Jaguar seems to be losing interest in giving GM a minority stake , said one individual close to the talks , adding , `` It would n't surprise me if Jaguar executives want to wait and see what the color of that Ford bid ) is '' first .
wsj_1225	13	He predicted Ford officials will meet with Jaguar executives in the next week to outline their proposed offer .
wsj_1225	14	Sir John Egan , Jaguar 's chairman , so far has refused to meet with Ford officials , but he is believed to be willing to consider a specific bid proposal .
wsj_1225	15	As for GM , its `` fallback position has to be a full bid itself , '' said Stephen Reitman , European auto-industry analyst at London brokers UBS-Phillips & Drew .
wsj_1225	16	A Ford takeover of Jaguar would `` have such implications for the balance of power in the 1990s that General Motors ca n't afford to step aside .
wsj_1225	17	They will have to throw their hat in the ring . ''
wsj_1225	18	A GM spokesman yesterday reiterated the company 's interest in acquiring a minority stake to help Jaguar remain independent .
wsj_1225	19	A pitched battle could mean Jaguar would fetch # 10 $ 16.02 a share , or about # 1.8 billion $ 2.88 billion , several analysts believe .
wsj_1225	20	The prospect of such a takeover fight has sent Jaguar shares soaring in recent weeks .
wsj_1225	21	U.S. takeover-stock speculators now own an estimated 25 % of Jaguar shares .
wsj_1225	22	In a declining London stock market yesterday , Jaguar shares were down four pence from Monday in late trading , at 694 pence $ 11.11 a share .
wsj_1225	23	In the U.S. , Jaguar 's American depositary receipts rose 12.5 cents in over-the-counter trading , to $ 11.25 .
wsj_1225	24	Both Ford and GM badly need a luxury brand to combat new competition from the Japanese in the European and U.S. markets .
wsj_1225	25	And financially strapped Jaguar has spent over a year looking for a rich uncle to provide cash and technological know-how .
wsj_1225	26	The company has expressed a preference for GM over Ford because GM has promised it would keep Jaguar independent .
wsj_1225	27	Ford 's need to acquire some or all of Jaguar became more acute last week when it abandoned a four-year effort to market its German-built Merkur Scorpio sedan as a European luxury import in the U.S. .
wsj_1225	28	Then , last Friday , Ford 's talks about a possible alliance with Saab-Scania AB of Sweden collapsed .
wsj_1225	29	GM 's interest in Jaguar reflects a desire to help diversify the U.S. company 's products in the growing luxury-car segment of the market .
wsj_1225	30	Its Opel line has a solid image and a recent string of highly successful new models , but it lacks Jaguar 's cachet .
wsj_1225	31	GM officials also see a lot of potential in marrying Jaguar 's cars to the technological know-how of Group Lotus PLC , a British engineering and specialty car maker GM bought in 1986 .
wsj_1226	0	Texaco Inc. reported an 11 % increase in third-quarter earnings , which it attributed partly to the company 's massive restructuring after it emerged from bankruptcy-law proceedings 18 months ago .
wsj_1226	1	Sun Co. also reported higher earnings .
wsj_1226	2	Meanwhile , like many other oil companies hurt by less-profitable downstream businesses , Mobil Corp. , Shell Oil Co. and Chevron Corp. reported lower quarterly earnings .
wsj_1226	3	Texaco 's exploration and production earnings improved as a result of its streamlining of those operations as it sold many of its marginal producing properties over the past 18 months .
wsj_1226	4	An increase in production at some major oil fields in the North Sea , which had been knocked out by an explosion in July 1988 , also aided results .
wsj_1226	5	The sale of a portion of refining and marketing operations to Saudi Arabia helped alleviate the decline in earnings from that business .
wsj_1226	6	`` The company has been completely revamped , '' said Frank Knuettel , analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc .
wsj_1226	7	Third-quarter net income at Texaco rose to $ 305 million from $ 274 million last year .
wsj_1226	8	Revenue declined 3.4 % , to $ 8.4 billion from $ 8.7 billion .
wsj_1226	9	Per-share earnings declined to $ 1.10 a share from $ 1.12 a share , largely because of 21 million additional shares issued to retire $ 1 billion of debt .
wsj_1226	10	Per-share earnings also shrank because of dividends on a new series of preferred stock .
wsj_1226	11	Sun Sun Co. 's net income climbed 18 % to $ 85 million , or 80 cents a share , from $ 72 million , or 67 cents a share .
wsj_1226	12	Revenue increased 11 % , to $ 2.73 billion from $ 2.46 billion .
wsj_1226	13	Sun said some of the growth reflects higher earnings in the oil sands operation of Suncor , a majority-owned Canadian subsidiary .
wsj_1226	14	Chairman Robert McClements Jr. said the synthetic crude oil production from the facility rose even as the price for that oil increased .
wsj_1226	15	Overseas exploration and production results also improved because of additional output from the North Sea Magnus Field , a portion of which was acquired by Sun earlier this year .
wsj_1226	16	Results declined , however , in Sun 's refining and marketing and coal businesses .
wsj_1226	17	Profits of Shell , a subsidiary of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group , tumbled $ 24 million , or 6.6 % , to $ 340 million , despite a gain of $ 30 million from an insurance settlement .
wsj_1226	18	President Frank Richardson attributed the decline to lower natural gas prices , which countered higher earnings from the crude oil sector of Shell 's exploration and production operation .

wsj_1248	0	A # 320 million $ 508 million British Airways PLC rights issue flopped badly -- the victim of recent market turbulence and the collapse of the buy-out bid for United Airlines ' parent , UAL Corp .
wsj_1248	1	The United Kingdom carrier had planned the issue to help finance its $ 750 million purchase of a 15 % stake in UAL .
wsj_1248	2	But British Airways withdrew from the UAL labor-management buy-out plan last Friday , after the group failed to get bank financing for its $ 6.79 billion buy-out .
wsj_1248	3	British Airways said its shareholders accepted only 6.3 % of the convertible capital bonds , but that the rest of the issue will be taken up by underwriters .
wsj_1248	4	Analysts said that 6.3 % level marked the poorest showing for any major British rights issue since the 1987 global stock market crash .
wsj_1248	5	`` It is close to being a record undersubscription , '' said Bob Bucknell , an analyst with London broker Smith New Court Securities .
wsj_1248	6	`` Fund managers do n't like to have rights issues that do n't have an obvious reason .
wsj_1248	7	The obvious reason was for British Air to buy a stake in United Airlines . ''
wsj_1248	8	In a statement , British Air Chairman Lord King said the company was `` obviously disappointed that the issue was not taken up , but it would have been unreasonable to expect a better result given the volatility of the stock market since the launch of the issue . ''
wsj_1248	9	But except for the embarrassment , British Air will emerge relatively unscathed from the flopped issue .
wsj_1248	10	Underwriters led by Lazard Brothers & Co. will pick up the rest of the airline 's offer of four convertible capital bonds for every nine common shares .
wsj_1248	11	Lazard and other primary underwriters have reduced or eliminated their exposure by sub-underwriting the issue among U.K. institutional investors .
wsj_1248	12	`` The paper loss here is very small '' for these sub-underwriters , observed John Nelson , a Lazard managing director .
wsj_1248	13	In any case , he added , `` most institutions probably wo n't sell '' the bonds .
wsj_1248	14	And instead of buying the UAL stake , the U.K. carrier will be able to reduce its high debt level and build an acquisition war chest .
wsj_1248	15	`` From a cash flow point of view , British Airways is better off not being in United Airlines in the short term , '' said Andy Chambers , an analyst at Nomura Research Institute in London .
wsj_1248	16	Added another U.K. analyst : `` It gives them some cash in the back pocket for when they want to do something . ''
wsj_1248	17	For instance , British Air is continuing to negotiate with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines about each acquiring a 20 % stake in Sabena World Airlines , the air transport subsidiary of the Belgian national airline .
wsj_1248	18	A definitive agreement had been expected by the end of July .
wsj_1248	19	The failed rights issue also should have a modest impact on British Air shares .
wsj_1248	20	The airline 's share price already is far below the 210 pence $ 3.33 level seen after the company announced the rights issue in late September .
wsj_1248	21	In late trading on London 's Stock Exchange yesterday , the shares were off three pence at 194 pence .
wsj_1248	22	And because British Air is issuing convertible bonds rather than ordinary shares , the share price wo n't be directly hurt by any surplus left with underwriters after they try to sell the issue in the open market .
wsj_1248	23	But British Air 's withdrawal from the UAL buy-out could have further repercussions .
wsj_1248	24	Some analysts speculated yesterday that the move has set off a board room split , which may lead to the resignation of Sir Colin Marshall , the carrier 's chief executive officer .
wsj_1248	25	`` The stories are rubbish , '' a British Air spokesman said .
wsj_1248	26	`` There is no difference of opinion between Chairman Lord King and Sir Colin on any aspect of company policy .
wsj_1250	0	Big gains for the ultra-right Republicans party in Baden-Wuerttemburg state municipal elections Sunday showed eroding support for Chancellor Helmut Kohl in a traditional bastion for his Christian Democratic Union .
wsj_1250	1	With ballots from most of the state 's major cities in by yesterday morning , the Republicans came away with 10 % of the vote in several of the key districts .
wsj_1250	2	With many rural districts yet to report ballots , election officials estimate support for Christian Democrats fell an average five percentage points statewide .
wsj_1250	3	The left-of-center Social Democrats and the environmental Greens party posted mixed results .
wsj_1250	4	Headed by a former Waffen SS sergeant and working from a nationalistic platform of anti-foreigner rhetoric , the fledgling Republicans party has scored surprising gains in earlier elections in the states of West Berlin , Hesse and North-Rhine Westphalia .
wsj_1250	5	With West German unemployment remaining high at two million jobless and the lack of affordable housing becoming a primary issue for next year 's campaign , the Republicans are seen drawing support for their `` Germans First '' stand on social-welfare issues .
wsj_1250	6	Election analysts acknowledge that a `` Red-Green '' coalition of Social Democrats and Greens could edge out Chancellor Kohl 's coalition in the December 1990 national election if support for the Republicans continues to spread .
wsj_1250	7	International investigators urged Britain to allow prosecution of suspected Nazi war criminals who took refuge there after 1945 .

wsj_1250	13	In a sign of easing tension between Beijing and Hong Kong , China said it will again take back illegal immigrants caught crossing into the British colony .

wsj_1250	16	Italy 's Foreign Ministry said it is investigating exports to the Soviet Union by an Ing . C. Olivetti & Co. subsidiary called OCN-PPL that makes numerically controlled machine tools .
wsj_1250	17	Although Italy 's investigation of whether Olivetti had violated Western export-control rules had previously been made known , this marked the first time the unit and product were named .
wsj_1250	18	The U.S. is worried about the convertibility of Olivetti 's machine tools to military use .
wsj_1250	19	However , an Olivetti spokeswoman said OCN-PPL , of which Olivetti sold the majority interest last year , `` does n't make equipment that has the type of precision necessary for sophisticated productions . ''
wsj_1250	20	Conservationists say that drift-net fishing threatens to wipe out much of the world 's tuna stocks in a few years .
wsj_1250	21	But the Japanese Fisheries Association criticized moves to ban the practice in international waters .
wsj_1250	22	`` It is really unfortunate for human beings to be swayed by emotional discussions , '' the association said .
wsj_1250	23	In driftnet , or `` wall of death , '' fishing , fleets lay nets up to three miles long that trap almost everything in their path .
wsj_1250	24	Earlier this year , Japan said it would cut the number of its drift-net vessels in the South Pacific by two-thirds , or down to 20 .
wsj_1250	25	Workers at Peugeot S.A. 's car plant at Sochaux , in eastern France , voted to end a six-week-old strike that has cost the Peugeot group production of 60,000 automobiles , a company spokesman said .
wsj_1250	26	The strikers voted to accept a series of management proposals that will give them a higher basic wage , better profit-sharing benefits and bigger annual bonuses .
wsj_1250	27	The spokesman said the vote at Sochaux is expected to be followed by a similar move at the company 's assembly plant at Mulhouse , where the number of strikers has been whittled down to 80 .
wsj_1250	28	About 8,000 National Union of Mineworkers members resumed their strike against De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. after further negotiations to settle a wage dispute broke down .
wsj_1250	29	Striking workers , who began striking five diamond mines on Oct. 13 , had returned to work last week when the union and De Beers arranged to reopen negotiations .
wsj_1250	30	A De Beers spokesman said yesterday the company had offered to increase the minimum wage by 18 % , while the union was demanding 26.6 % .
wsj_1250	31	Before the two parties resumed talks last week , De Beers offered 17 % and the union wanted 37.6 % .
wsj_1250	32	China 's People 's Daily took note of the growing problem of computer fraud .

wsj_1250	34	The number of computers has mushroomed in recent years , with 10,000 in use , as well as 30,000 miniature models .
wsj_1250	35	But security systems , effective management controls and regulations to govern their use have not kept pace , the People 's Daily said .

wsj_1251	1	The report to Congress said that fatalities rose 18 % in 1987 and 13 % in 1988 on rural interstates .
wsj_1251	2	The 1987 highway bill permitted states to raise the speed limit to 65 mph from 55 mph on interstate roads , which are defined as highways that pass through areas with fewer than 50,000 people .
wsj_1251	3	Since 1987 , 40 states have increased the speed limit on rural interstates .
wsj_1251	4	`` About one-third of the fatality increase is attributed to greater travel , and about two-thirds is attributed to other factors primarily to greater speed , '' according to NHTSA .
wsj_1251	5	The report showed that deaths on urban interstate highways rose 7 % between 1986 and last year , while fatalities on non-interstate roads were about the same in 1988 as in 1986 .
wsj_1251	6	In states that raised the speed limit on rural interstates , the fatality rate rose about 18 % to 1.7 deaths per 100 million miles traveled between 1986 and 1988 .
wsj_1251	7	In contrast , the fatality rate in the states that retained the 55 mph limit was 0.9 last year , the same as in 1986 .

wsj_1254	0	The government said it would streamline its enormous and often-criticized food marketing and distribution network , Compania Nacional de Subsistencias Populares , or Conasupo .
wsj_1254	1	Conasupo Director Ignacio Ovalle Fernandez said the agency will sell 589 midsized supermarkets and several food-production plants and warehouses beginning early next year .
wsj_1254	2	The agency will withdraw from the production of nine food products , maintaining production of the two most important ones , corn and milk .
wsj_1254	3	Mr. Ovalle also said Conasupo will cut back subsidies to producers of nonessential farm products and close retail outlets in wealthy neighborhoods .
wsj_1254	4	The agency 's workers and private companies would be allowed to bid for the assets up for sale .
wsj_1254	5	Conasupo controls prices on agricultural goods and operates retail outlets where basic consumer items are sold at state-subsidized prices .
wsj_1254	6	Business leaders have long criticized the agency as a leading example of bureacratic waste .
wsj_1254	7	Private-sector leaders praised the Conasupo restructuring .
wsj_1254	8	But most economists doubt the streamlining would cut deeply into Conasupo government subsidy , which largely goes to reduce consumer prices for corn and milk .
wsj_1255	0	The Food and Drug Administration banned all imports of mushrooms from China in response to a rash of food-poisoning outbreaks linked to canned Chinese mushrooms .
wsj_1255	1	`` The agency has concluded that contamination may be widespread throughout the mushroom-processing industry in China , '' an FDA spokesman said yesterday .
wsj_1255	2	The agency wo n't allow mushrooms that were canned or packed in brine at any Chinese plant to enter the U.S. until `` satisfactory sanitation-control measures are implemented in China to prevent '' bacterial contamination .
wsj_1255	3	On May 19 , the FDA began detaining Chinese mushrooms in 68-ounce cans after more than 100 people in Mississippi , New York and Pennsylvania became ill from eating tainted mushrooms .
wsj_1255	4	In subsequent tests , the agency found smaller-size cans from several Chinese plants to be similarly contaminated .
wsj_1255	5	The outbreaks were traced to staphylococcus aureus , a type of bacteria that produces a toxin capable of surviving the high temperatures used in canning vegetables .
wsj_1255	6	A recall of the mushrooms blamed for the food poisoning began in early March .
wsj_1255	7	In 1987 , China exported 65 million pounds of mushrooms , valued at $ 47 million , to the U.S. .
wsj_1255	8	The shipments went mostly to food-service distributors that supply pizzerias and restaurants .
wsj_1255	9	A spokesman for the Chinese Embassy here said that the Beijing government has taken `` many effective measures '' to stop the mushroom contamination and is further investigating the underlying causes .
wsj_1255	10	He predicted the problem will be solved `` very soon . ''
wsj_1257	0	Ramada Inc. revised the terms of its restructuring and extended to Feb. 28 , 1990 , ) the deadline to complete the sale of its hotel business to New World Development Co. of Hong Kong and Prime Motor Inns Inc. of Fairfield , N.J .
wsj_1257	1	Ramada 's previous plan was derailed by upheaval in the junk-bond market that hindered the offering of $ 400 million in high-yield securities of Aztar Corp. , the new company that will operate Ramada 's casinos in Nevada and Atlantic City ,
wsj_1257	2	Under the new terms , New World will still pay $ 540 million for Ramada 's hotel business , subject to adjustment at closing , but Ramada will now reimburse New World for $ 10 million in expenses .
wsj_1257	3	Prime will still manage Ramada 's domestic franchise system when the sale closes .
wsj_1257	4	Revised terms call for each Ramada common share to be exchanged for $ 1 in cash , subject to possible reduction , and one share of Aztar common stock .
wsj_1257	5	Shareholders will also receive one cent per share for the redemption of preferred stock purchase rights .
wsj_1257	6	The cash payout will be reduced by 40 % of any amount by which the weighted mean price of Ramada 's common stock exceeds $ 14 on the day the transaction closes .
wsj_1257	7	The provision will help provide for tax liabilities that may stem from the restructuring .
wsj_1257	8	Ramada 's stock rose 87.5 cents on the news to close at $ 11.25 in composite New York Stock Exchange trading .
wsj_1257	9	The announcement dispelled some Wall Street observers ' fears that New World might demand a huge premium for the delay , or scrap the deal entirely .
wsj_1257	10	The previous deadline to complete the sale was Nov. 30 .
wsj_1257	11	One major advantage of the revised plan is that Aztar will have far less debt than under the old terms .
wsj_1257	12	`` They 'll go from being one of the most leveraged to one of the least leveraged casino companies , '' said Daniel Lee , an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc .
wsj_1257	13	Mr. Lee values the package at between $ 15 and $ 20 a share , based on current trading prices of other casino-company stocks .
wsj_1257	14	The much-revised restructuring , which was first announced in October 1988 , must again be approved by shareholders and state casino regulators in Nevada and New Jersey .
wsj_1257	15	Financing plans include raising $ 170 million in debt secured by the company 's holdings in New Jersey .
wsj_1257	16	In May , Ramada sold its Marie Callender Pie Shops Inc. unit to a group of private investors as part of its plan to focus on its casinos in Atlantic City and in Las Vegas and Laughlin , Nev .
wsj_1259	0	The Wall Street Journal `` American Way of Buying '' Survey consists of two separate , door-to-door nationwide polls conducted for the Journal by Peter D. Hart Research Associates and the Roper Organization .
wsj_1259	1	The two surveys , which asked different questions , were conducted using national random probability samples .
wsj_1259	2	The poll conducted by Peter D. Hart Research Associates interviewed 2,064 adults age 18 and older from June 15 to June 30 , 1989 .
wsj_1259	3	The poll conducted by the Roper Organization interviewed 2,002 adults age 18 and older from July 7 to July 15 , 1989 .
wsj_1259	4	Responses were weighted on the basis of age and gender to conform with U.S. Census data .
wsj_1259	5	For each poll , the odds are 19 out of 20 that if pollsters had sought to survey every household in the U.S. using the same questionnaire , the findings would differ from these poll results by no more than 2 1/2 percentage points in either direction .
wsj_1259	6	The margin of error for subgroups -- for example , married women with children at home -- would be larger .
wsj_1259	7	In addition , in any survey , there is always the chance that other factors such as question wording could introduce errors into the findings .

wsj_1260	0	Ironically , American Airlines ' attempt to lead industry prices higher was reported in the same issue as your survey showing that consumers had the least confidence in the airline industry Sept. 20 .
wsj_1260	1	You quote Robert Crandall , chairman of American 's parent , AMR Corp. , as having said that discount deals for big customers would be `` dumb '' because `` you will go to Detroit because you have to go to Detroit whether the fare is $ 175 , $ 275 or $ 375 . ''
wsj_1260	2	Even if Mr. Crandall is correct , he of all people must realize our society relies on competition to keep prices at a competitive level .
wsj_1260	3	In 1986 , he settled an antitrust suit based on a taped telephone conversation of him proposing to Braniff 's president that they both raise fares 20 % .
wsj_1260	4	Braniff declined .
wsj_1260	5	When I asked American Airlines for its side of the story for use in my MBA class , where I teach business ethics , it did not respond .
wsj_1260	6	Perhaps the ethics of an industry 's leader filters down and is one of the factors that ultimately shapes consumer trust in that industry .

wsj_1263	0	The management turnover at Reebok International Ltd. continued with the resignation of company president C. Joseph LaBonte , who joined Reebok just two years ago .
wsj_1263	1	Mr. LaBonte 's departure follows by two months the resignation of Mark Goldston as senior vice president and chief marketing officer after only 11 months at Reebok .
wsj_1263	2	The resignations by the two executives , considered hard-charging and abrasive by Reebok insiders , reflect a difference in style with Paul Fireman , chairman and chief executive , according to several former executives .
wsj_1263	3	The two executives are among a number of outsiders recruited by Reebok in the past few years to help it make the transition from a small start-up company to a marketing giant with sales last year of $ 1.79 billion .
wsj_1263	4	The changes come as Reebok , which grew rapidly in the mid-1980s but has seen its sales flatten of late , is seeking to regain momentum in the athletic-shoe business against rivals Nike Inc. and L.A. Gear Inc .
wsj_1263	5	The departures , said Alice Ruth , an analyst at Montgomery Securities in San Francisco , should enable the company to focus on business issues instead of management differences .
wsj_1263	6	`` I think it 's more an issue of style .
wsj_1263	7	I would view it as a net positive .
wsj_1263	8	The company can go about its business .
wsj_1263	9	They 're in the midst of a turnaround , '' she noted .
wsj_1263	10	Earnings have rebounded in 1989 after a 20 % decline last year .
wsj_1263	11	A former executive agreed that the departures do n't reflect major problems , adding : `` If you see any company that grows as fast as Reebok did , it is going to have people coming and going . ''
wsj_1263	12	Reebok said Mr. LaBonte will resume the presidency of Vantage Group Inc. , a California-based venture capital firm that he founded in 1983 .
wsj_1263	13	Before that he was president and chief operating officer of Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corp .
wsj_1263	14	Reebok added that Mr. Fireman will assume the title of president .
wsj_1263	15	A spokesman said that neither Mr. Fireman nor Mr. LaBonte would be available for comment .
wsj_1263	16	`` We will not be commenting beyond the news release , '' the spokesman said .
wsj_1263	17	Mr. Goldston , who had been president of Faberge Inc. 's Faberge U.S.A. division before joining Reebok in September 1988 , left in August to pursue other interests .
wsj_1265	0	MCA Inc. said its toy-making unit agreed to buy Buddy L Corp. , producer of a line of toy vehicles and preschool products .
wsj_1265	1	The price was n't disclosed , but an executive of LJN Toys Ltd. , the MCA unit , said the closely held Buddy L had annual sales in excess of $ 20 million .
wsj_1265	2	The 40-year-old Buddy L concern , based in New York , designs and develops toys under the names `` Buddy L '' and `` My First Buddy , '' he said .

wsj_1273	0	Reaching for that extra bit of yield can be a big mistake -- especially if you do n't understand what you 're investing in .
wsj_1273	1	Just ask Richard Blumenfeld , a New Jersey dentist who considers himself `` a reasonably sophisticated investor . ''
wsj_1273	2	In May 1986 , Dr. Blumenfeld gave Merrill Lynch & Co. about $ 40,000 for a federally insured certificate of deposit offering an effective yield of more than 9 % .
wsj_1273	3	`` It was a time when interest rates came down very rapidly , '' Dr. Blumenfeld recalls .
wsj_1273	4	Yields on five-year CDs at major banks were averaging about 7.45 % , and 10-year Treasury notes were paying less than 8 % .
wsj_1273	5	The CD seemed like a great deal .
wsj_1273	6	But nearly 3 1/2 years later , Merrill says the investment is worth about $ 43,000 -- an amount that represents an annual return of just over 2 % on Dr. Blumenfeld 's $ 40,000 .
wsj_1273	7	The problem is that the CD he bought for a retirement plan was n't a plain vanilla CD .
wsj_1273	8	Instead , his Merrill broker put him in a zero-coupon CD , which is sold at a deep discount to its face value .
wsj_1273	9	The difference between the price and the face value payable at maturity is the investor 's return .
wsj_1273	10	More important , the CD was purchased on the secondary , or resale , market .
wsj_1273	11	Because the CD had an effective yield of 13.4 % when it was issued in 1984 , and interest rates in general had declined sharply since then , part of the price Dr. Blumenfeld paid was a premium -- an additional amount on top of the CD 's base value plus accrued interest that represented the CD 's increased market value .
wsj_1273	12	Now the thrift that issued the CD is insolvent , and Dr. Blumenfeld has learned to his surprise that the premium is n't insured under federal deposit insurance .
wsj_1273	13	The tip-off came when he opened a recent Merrill Lynch statement and found that the CD 's `` estimated current market value '' had plummeted by $ 9,000 in a month .
wsj_1273	14	Several phone calls and a visit to his broker 's office later , the dentist found out that the $ 9,000 drop represented the current value of the premium he paid when he bought the CD , and that the amount was n't insured .
wsj_1273	15	`` This is one thing I was never aware of , '' he says .
wsj_1273	16	He assumed that principal and interest were `` fully insured up to $ 100,000 , '' he adds .
wsj_1273	17	Dr. Blumenfeld is n't unique .
wsj_1273	18	Especially at times like these , when declining rates make it hard for investors to get yields they have come to expect , too many people chase the promise of above-market returns without fully appreciating the risk .
wsj_1273	19	`` Yield greed often gets in the way of understanding things , '' says John Markese , research director of the American Association of Individual Investors , a Chicago-based educational group .
wsj_1273	20	`` The biggest problem we have is that investors realize , after the fact , that they did n't understand what they were investing in . ''
wsj_1273	21	Dr. Blumenfeld concedes he did n't fully understand what he was buying .
wsj_1273	22	He says that he knew he was getting a zero-coupon CD and that he had previously invested in TIGRs Treasury Income Growth Receipts , a type of zero-coupon Treasury security sold by Merrill Lynch .
wsj_1273	23	But he says he did n't understand he was buying the CD on the secondary market , and he contends his broker never fully explained the risks .
wsj_1273	24	The broker , Thomas Beairsto of Merrill Lynch 's Morristown , N.J. , office , refuses to discuss the matter with a reporter , referring inquiries to Merrill Lynch officials in New York .
wsj_1273	25	Those officials say there was full disclosure of the risks in a `` fact sheet '' sent to all CD investors with their confirmation of sale .
wsj_1273	26	The fact sheet , dated April 1986 , says on page three : `` If the price paid for a CD purchased in the secondary market ... is higher than the accreted value in the case of zero-coupon CDs , the difference ... is not insured ... .
wsj_1273	27	Computations involving zero-coupon CDs are more complicated and you should discuss any questions you may have with your financial consultant . ''
wsj_1273	28	Dr. Blumenfeld says he does n't remember the paragraph about premiums in the fact sheet he received and did n't realize part of what he paid was a premium .
wsj_1273	29	`` I assumed I was buying a CD as a CD , '' he says .
wsj_1273	30	Nevertheless , Merrill Lynch has agreed that if the thrift that issued Dr. Blumenfeld 's CD , Peoples Heritage Federal Savings & Loan Association in Salina , Kan. , is liquidated and the CD terminated , the brokerage firm would cover the premium Dr. Blumenfeld paid .
wsj_1273	31	Federal deposit insurance would pay principal and interest accrued to the date of liquidation , to a maximum of $ 100,000 . )
wsj_1273	32	`` It 's not a blanket commitment , it 's a case-by-case situation , '' says Albert Disposti , a managing director of Merrill Lynch Money Markets Inc .
wsj_1273	33	`` There 's a question whether brokers at the time were fully aware '' of the risks .
wsj_1273	34	`` We were n't sure that full disclosure , as we wanted it , was being made . ''
wsj_1273	35	Merrill Lynch says it 's impossible to estimate how many investors are in Dr. Blumenfeld 's situation , although it says the firm has received only one other complaint about premiums on the secondary market in three years .
wsj_1273	36	Merrill Lynch now provides credit rating information about the institutions whose CDs it sells , which it did n't provide in 1986 .
wsj_1273	37	Zero-coupon CDs are only a small portion of the $ 1 trillion-plus in CDs outstanding , and those purchased on the secondary market are an even smaller part of the total .
wsj_1273	38	Merrill Lynch estimates that fewer than 10 financial institutions currently issue zero-coupon CDs .
wsj_1273	39	Still , there are several billion dollars of zero-coupon CDs with various maturities outstanding .
wsj_1273	40	Because of the tax consequences of zero-coupon investments -- income tax is payable in the year interest is accrued , although interest is n't actually paid until maturity -- zero-coupon CDs are usually sold for tax-advantaged accounts to finance things like retirement and children 's education .
wsj_1273	41	Most zero-coupon CDs are in maturities of six to nine years , and they usually double in value by maturity .
wsj_1273	42	But investors who bought zero-coupon CDs in the secondary market are n't the only ones who may be surprised to learn the full amount of their investments is n't insured .
wsj_1273	43	People who paid a premium for standard CDs purchased on the secondary market could also find that those premiums are n't insured if the institutions that issued the CDs failed .
wsj_1273	44	However , those premiums are usually far smaller than on zero-coupon CDs , and the simpler pricing structure of a standard CD makes it more apparent when a premium is paid .
wsj_1273	45	Whatever the case , a Merrill Lynch spokesman emphasizes , investors should n't have to worry about the uninsured premium issue , unless the bank or thrift that issued the CD is closed and its deposits paid off before maturity or transferred to another institution at a lower rate .
wsj_1273	46	Dr. Blumenfeld says he 's satisfied that his problem has been resolved .
wsj_1273	47	And he says he 's learned a lesson : `` You always have to watch out for yourself .
wsj_1273	48	No one else will watch out for you .

wsj_1279	2	`` I am convinced that a monetary policy for this country that would return interest rates to the historical level of 4 % or 5 % would have not only an immediate impact on housing starts , the housing stock , our industry in America , the refurbishing of our industrial system , it would help the Third World economies considerably and it would particularly have a favorable impact upon our budget deficit , '' Mr. Kemp said .

wsj_1280	0	McDonald 's Corp. said third-quarter earnings rose 14 % on a hefty sales gain , but domestic franchisees apparently did n't partake of the improvement .
wsj_1280	1	The world 's largest fast-food chain said net income rose to $ 217.9 million , or 59 cents a share , from $ 191.3 million , or 51 cents a share , a year ago .
wsj_1280	2	In the latest period , the company had an average of 370.8 million shares , 5.6 million shares below last year 's level .
wsj_1280	3	Revenue rose 12 % to $ 1.63 billion from $ 1.46 billion .
wsj_1280	4	Systemwide sales , which include sales at franchisee as well as company-owned stores , totaled $ 4.59 billion compared with $ 4.2 billion .
wsj_1280	5	But sales for U.S. franchisees were flat at best on a per-store basis despite weak 1988 figures .
wsj_1280	6	Compared with the first nine months of last year , average franchisee store sales this year were down nearly $ 3,200 , reflecting a fierce discounting war among fast-food chains .
wsj_1280	7	Since McDonald 's menu prices rose this year , the actual decline may have been more .
wsj_1280	8	McDonald 's closed at $ 31.375 , up $ 1 , in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday .
wsj_1280	9	While franchisees were having a tough time holding sales , McDonald 's company-operated stores posted hefty gains for the nine months , with sales per company-operated unit rising $ 20,000 .
wsj_1280	10	One analyst noted that the company often has better store locations than do its franchisees , thus aiding promotional efforts .
wsj_1280	11	On average in the latest nine months , company-operated units in the U.S. had $ 90,552 more in sales than did franchised outlets .
wsj_1280	12	There are more than three times as many franchised domestic outlets as there are company stores .
wsj_1280	13	Profit margins at U.S. company-owned stores in the quarter were up nearly 1 % , which the company attributed in part to lower food costs .
wsj_1280	14	Prudential-Bache Securities analyst Leslie Steppel said reduced labor costs helped boost margins , although she doubted `` that kind of performance is sustainable . ''
wsj_1280	15	Calling sales `` still relatively soft , '' Ms. Steppel believes that in real terms , U.S. sales slipped 3 1/2 % to 4 % at company-operated stores in the quarter .
wsj_1280	16	Apparently acknowledging weaker U.S. sales systemwide , McDonald 's vowed `` to use our size and muscle to do all that is necessary to build the brand . ''
wsj_1280	17	Overseas , both franchisees and the company performed substantially better than a year ago .
wsj_1280	18	Third-quarter sales in Europe were exceptionally strong , boosted by promotional programs and new products -- although weaker foreign currencies reduced the company 's earnings .
wsj_1280	19	McDonald 's said that systemwide sales would have been $ 115 million greater had 1988 exchange rates remained in effect .
wsj_1280	20	`` Going into the fourth quarter the sales comparison will be more difficult , '' predicted restaurant analyst Howard Hansen of Kidder , Peabody & Co .
wsj_1280	21	Reflecting better growth prospects abroad , McDonald 's noted that as of Sept. 30 more stores were under construction overseas than a year ago , while the opposite was true for domestic expansion .
wsj_1280	22	At the end of the third quarter McDonald 's had 10,873 units operating world-wide .
wsj_1280	23	In the nine months , earnings rose 12 % to $ 555.6 million , or $ 1.49 a share , from $ 494.4 million , or $ 1.31 a share , a year earlier .
wsj_1280	24	Revenue rose 11 % to $ 4.56 billion from $ 4.12 billion .
wsj_1281	0	Carnival Cruise Lines Inc. 's common stock was dragged down yesterday amid concerns that a bankruptcy filing by a Finnish shipbuilder would delay delivery of three big cruise ships .
wsj_1281	1	The Miami-based company 's stock fell $ 1.75 yesterday to $ 20.75 a share in heavy American Stock Exchange composite trading .
wsj_1281	2	Early yesterday , Carnival said in a company statement that it had been `` notified unofficially '' that Waertsilae Marine Industries , the Finnish shipyard that is building its three new cruise ships , planned to file for bankruptcy .
wsj_1281	3	Officials at Carnival declined to comment .
wsj_1281	4	`` There is just a tremendous amount of uncertainty about what the effect , if any , of all this is , '' said John P. Uphoff , an analyst at Raymond James Associates Inc .
wsj_1281	5	`` I did n't even know that a company in a socialistic country could file for bankruptcy . ''
wsj_1281	6	Carnival said the `` Fantasy , '' the first of the three $ 200 million ships that Carnival has on order , is scheduled to be delivered next month , just in time for the winter tourist season in the Caribbean .
wsj_1281	7	That ship , which would carry about 2,050 passengers , would expand the capacity of Carnival 's existing 14-ship fleet by 24 % .
wsj_1281	8	The second ship , which is half-completed , is scheduled to be delivered in fall 1990 , and the third in fall 1991 .
wsj_1281	9	`` There 's a 99 % chance that the Fantasy will be delivered close to schedule , '' said Caroline Levy , an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc .
wsj_1281	10	`` The others will probably be delivered as well , but Carnival will likely have to pay a higher price for them . ''
wsj_1281	11	She said the company could pay as much as 25 % more for the ships .
wsj_1281	12	If the ships are n't delivered , however , it will likely have an effect on the company 's earnings as soon as the 1990 fiscal year , which begins Dec. 1 .
wsj_1281	13	Analysts said those estimates -- which range from about $ 1.80 a share to $ 1.95 a share -- are based on Fantasy being in operation in 1990 .
wsj_1281	14	If the ship fails to arrive , those per-share earnings estimates could be trimmed 15 cents or more .
wsj_1281	15	Analysts were n't willing to speculate on how much money Carnival might lose through deposits .
wsj_1281	16	Normally , a company pays a portion of the total cost of a ship as it reaches various stages of construction .
wsj_1281	17	Carnival , for example , has already paid about $ 160 million of the total cost for Fantasy .
wsj_1281	18	Some analysts say this may give it the right to seize the ship if the situation warrants it .
wsj_1281	19	According to reports from Finland , Waertsilae Marine , 19%-owned by conglomerate Oy Waertsilae , filed for bankruptcy yesterday after the shipyard 's contractors had started to demand bank guarantees .
wsj_1281	20	The shipyard disclosed in mid-August that it expected losses stemming from a series of unprofitable orders .
wsj_1282	0	Designer Sandra Garratt filed for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy Code protection , saying that her cash flow had been cut off .
wsj_1282	1	The designer , whose line of modular , one-size-fits-all clothing has spawned a host of clones , has been in a dispute with her latest licensee , Jerell Inc. for several months .
wsj_1282	2	Ms. Garratt was the subject of a Wall Street Journal article in March .
wsj_1282	3	The designer 's attorney , Molly Bartholow , said that Ms. Garratt was forced to start bankruptcy-law proceedings because Jerell began withholding her royalty payments last month .
wsj_1282	4	Jerell paid Ms. Garratt royalties for the line known as Multiples by Sandra Garratt , which are sold primarily through department stores .
wsj_1282	5	Ms. Garratt sued the Dallas apparel maker earlier this year , charging that Jerell developed and marketed clothing lines fashioned after her designs , in violation of their contract .
wsj_1282	6	That lawsuit is still pending .
wsj_1282	7	Jerell could n't immediately be reached for comment .
wsj_1282	8	Ms. Garratt 's assets and liabilities were n't disclosed .
wsj_1283	0	Eaton Corp. had a 26 % drop in third-quarter profit mainly because of lower sales of truck parts , its largest and most profitable single business .
wsj_1283	1	Sales of medium and heavy-duty trucks continue to lag previous-year rates , leading Eaton to expect fourth-quarter net income to fall below year-earlier levels , said Stephen R. Hardis , vice chairman and chief financial and administrative officer .
wsj_1283	2	He declined to make a specific earnings estimate .
wsj_1283	3	Third-quarter net was $ 40 million , or $ 1.04 a share , from $ 54.4 million , or $ 1.47 a share , a year ago .
wsj_1283	4	Sales rose 2.8 % to $ 864.1 million , from $ 840.4 million .
wsj_1283	5	The quarter net was below analyst expectations mainly because truck-parts sales did n't rebound in September from the summer doldrums as they usually do , said Patrick E. Sheridan , analyst with McDonald & Co .
wsj_1283	6	Mr. Sheridan , who had been expecting quarter profit of about $ 1.25 a share , says he is reducing his estimate for the year to the area of $ 5.70 a share , from his previous estimate of $ 6.10 .
wsj_1283	7	Eli Lustgarten of PaineWebber Inc. , who a couple of weeks ago reduced his 1989 estimate to $ 5.70 a share because of the weakening truck market , says he will make another cut to about $ 5.50 a share in light of the third-quarter report .
wsj_1283	8	He said Eaton 's quarter profit margin on controls was lower than he anticipated .
wsj_1283	9	Eaton said sales of truck axles , transmissions and other parts fell 7.2 % to $ 295 million .
wsj_1283	10	Sales of parts for cars and construction vehicles rose .
wsj_1283	11	Eaton does n't provide profit figures separately for each category , but operating profit for vehicle parts as a group fell 26 % to $ 51 million on an about 1 % drop in sales to $ 488 million .
wsj_1283	12	Mr. Hardis said truck-fleet operators appear to be cautious about buying new trucks until they see how the economy behaves .
wsj_1283	13	The truck sales slowdown reflects the general slowing in sales of consumer goods , he said , and the latest reports show a slight improvement rather than any indication of a downward spiral .
wsj_1283	14	Operating profit from electrical and electronics controls , Eaton 's other major business group , fell 11 % to $ 32 million , despite a 7.7 % increase in sales to $ 376 million .
wsj_1283	15	The company attributed the decline to weakness in the commercial-switch market in North America and in the European appliance-controls market .
wsj_1283	16	For the nine months , net -- including profit from discontinued operations both years and in 1988 an extraordinary charge of $ 17.7 million related to settlement of a lawsuit -- was $ 170.6 million , or $ 4.54 a share , up 5.8 % from $ 161.3 million , or $ 4.32 a share , a year ago .
wsj_1283	17	Eaton earned from continuing operations $ 165.1 million , or $ 4.40 a share , down 7 % from $ 177.5 million , or $ 4.76 a share , a year earlier .
wsj_1283	18	Nine-month sales were $ 2.79 billion , up 8.2 % from $ 2.58 billion a year earlier .
wsj_1283	19	In New York Stock Exchange composite trading , Eaton closed at $ 57.50 a share , down $ 2.50 .
wsj_1284	0	In Poland 's rapid shift from socialism to an undefined alternative , environmental issues have become a cutting edge of broader movements to restructure the economy , cut cumbersome bureaucracies , and democratize local politics .
wsj_1284	1	Initial steps were taken at Poland 's first international environmental conference , which I attended last month .
wsj_1284	2	The conference , held in Lower Silesia , was co-sponsored by the Environment Ministry , the Rockefeller Brothers Fund , and the Polish Ecological Club , and was attended by 50 Poles from government and industry , as well as Hungarians , Czechs , Russians , Japanese and Americans .
wsj_1284	3	The conference was entitled `` Economic Mechanisms for Environmental Protection , '' a significant departure from East Bloc usage , which recognizes only one economic mechanism -- central planning -- to direct industrial behavior .
wsj_1284	4	Even more remarkably , it focused on emissions trading and similar market approaches to address pollution , notwithstanding Poland 's lack of functioning markets .
wsj_1284	5	Why did East Bloc participants unanimously endorse market-based pollution approaches ?
wsj_1284	6	The answer lies both in the degraded environment of these countries and the perceived causes of that degradation .
wsj_1284	7	Like other East Bloc countries , Poland possesses environmental laws more honored in their breach than in their observance .
wsj_1284	8	According to a detailed report by Zbigniew Bochniarz of the University of Minnesota 's Hubert Humphrey Institute , 27 areas containing a third of Poland 's population are regarded as `` ecological hazards '' due to multiple violations of standards .
wsj_1284	9	Norms are consistently exceeded at 60 % of nitrogen oxide monitoring sites and 80 % of those for dust and soot emissions .
wsj_1284	10	Four-fifths of Poland 's soils have become highly acidified ; 70 % of its southern forests are projected to die by century 's end .
wsj_1284	11	Between 1965 and 1985 , Polish waters fit for human consumption dropped from 33 % to 6 % of all surface waters , while those unfit even for industry use nearly doubled .
wsj_1284	12	Poland produces about 20 times more soot and five times more sulfur dioxide and solid waste per unit of gross national product than does Western Europe .
wsj_1284	13	Its mortality rate for males over 35 is about 50 % higher than West Germany 's , and 50 % higher in hazard areas than the national average .
wsj_1284	14	Since 1978 , average annual growth rates for most pollutants have outstripped the growth of GNP .
wsj_1284	15	Conference participants saw these effects as flowing directly from a Marxist devaluation of environmental resources , which are not produced by labor ; b planned economies ' inability to control pollution where enterprises are state-owned and penalties are paid by the government ; and c the continuing Stalinist emphasis on heavy industry for economic development , producing a far heavier and more wasteful use of energy and natural resources than in the West .
wsj_1284	16	They repeatedly noted that environmental progress could not be secured without true ownership , genuine competition based on market factors , and the risk of bankruptcy if a business makes the wrong decisions .
wsj_1284	17	The solutions they formally proposed included lead/sulfur taxes , conservation and recycling incentives , reforestation offsets , transferable pollution permits , an ecological bank to finance pollution-reduction credits , and debt-for-environment swaps .
wsj_1284	18	But their most fundamental recommendation was to separate industry from the state , making it fully accountable for pollution control .
wsj_1284	19	A revolution takes more than conference manifestos .
wsj_1284	20	Indeed , skepticism was amply captured by a joke told by Poles at the conference : `` The world must be coming to an end .
wsj_1284	21	The Russians are talking peace .
wsj_1284	22	The Palestinians are talking elections .
wsj_1284	23	And the Poles are engaged in commerce . ''
wsj_1284	24	But the implications of such a shift to market approaches go well beyond the fact that Poland is already working on nationwide emissions trades to reduce smelter pollution , or that the Soviets plan to introduce marketable pollution permits in some republics next year .
wsj_1284	25	Those implications include : -- Privatization .
wsj_1284	26	Faced with a $ 40 billion foreign debt and skyrocketing inflation , Poland must privatize industry and eliminate subsidies to stabilize its currency and qualify for international assistance .
wsj_1284	27	Market-based pollution control may consume some capital that would otherwise purchase state industries .
wsj_1284	28	But it could also accelerate `` marketization '' by reinforcing industrial accountability , breaking up state monopolies , giving managers a stake in solutions , and ensuring that modernization is not reversible for failure to address environmental effects .
wsj_1284	29	As conferees noted , scarce capital means the costs of control must be minimized through a broad menu of compliance choices for individual firms .
wsj_1284	30	That means simple , clear rules that secure the first large blocks of reduction , deferring more complex issues such as risk .
wsj_1284	31	It also means use of quantity-based pollution limits such as transferable permits , rather than price-based limits such as effluent fees .
wsj_1284	32	That 's because quota-trained managers will likely respond better to quantity than to price signals .
wsj_1284	33	Even least-cost environmental solutions will require billions of dollars .
wsj_1284	34	New types of financing must make funds available without draining Poland 's hard-currency reserves .
wsj_1284	35	East Bloc pollution data typically have been state secrets .
wsj_1284	36	While Polish data have been freely available since 1980 , it was no accident that participants urged the free flow of information .
wsj_1284	37	For once information flows , public participation follows and repression becomes difficult to reimpose .
wsj_1284	38	One participant prematurely declared that America has had a free market in goods but a planned economy for environmental protection , while Poland represents the opposite .
wsj_1284	39	His point : It will be increasingly difficult for the U.S. to cling to command-and-control measures if even the East Bloc steps to a different drummer .
wsj_1284	40	At the moment , Poland resembles 19th-century Pittsburgh more than a modern industrial society -- with antiquated production , inadequate environmental management , and little ecological awareness .
wsj_1284	41	But the continuing pressures for free-market economics suggest the conference 's vision was not all fantasy .
wsj_1284	42	Mr. Levin , former head of EPA 's regulatory reform staff , adapted this from his November column for the Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association .
wsj_1287	0	International Business Machines Corp. unveiled a broad strategy to tackle the biggest problem that manufacturers face when computerizing their operations : Most machines ca n't talk to each other .
wsj_1287	1	The company unveiled more than 50 products , mostly software , that are designed to integrate the three areas of a manufacturing operation -- the plant floor , design operations and production planning .
wsj_1287	2	The aim , ultimately , is to increase the flow of information into a manufacturer 's main computer network for use in business planning , marketing and other operations .
wsj_1287	3	Manufacturers have already spent so heavily on automation that they are one of the computer industry 's leading revenue sources .
wsj_1287	4	But many manufacturers find that communication between different computers has been rendered nearly impossible by the babel of computer languages used by different machines , including robots and machine tools .
wsj_1287	5	IBM 's announcement , which was expected and will formally be made to customers today , also marks an attempt to gain credibility on the plant floor , where Digital Equipment Corp. has long dominated and where Hewlett-Packard Co. has recently gained market share .
wsj_1287	6	Consultants have said that it will take a while for all the pieces of the IBM strategy to fall into place , even though the specific products IBM unveiled will generally be available by the end of the first quarter .
wsj_1287	7	Sam Albert , a consultant in Scarsdale , N.Y. , said that in the past IBM has developed broad software strategies only for problems that crossed industry lines .
wsj_1287	8	He said he believes IBM 's decision to invest this sort of effort into a single industry showed that it was getting serious about understanding customers ' problems and was n't just selling technology .
wsj_1287	9	He said he expects IBM to unveil similar strategies for other industries in coming months .
wsj_1287	10	IBM 's push is also unusual in its approach to marketing .
wsj_1287	11	Rather than just send out marketing people to knock on customers ' doors , IBM is making several hundred of its own manufacturing people available to discuss specific needs .
wsj_1287	12	IBM 's manufacturing staff also will be able to provide software that IBM has developed internally and will be able to form teams with a customer to jointly solve manufacturing problems .
wsj_1287	13	IBM can obviously bring its expertise to bear on problems related to computer manufacturing , but it could also help customers on software to deal with such things as changes in engineering documents .
wsj_1287	14	`` We may not have every manufacturing problem , but we have most , '' said George Conrades , IBM 's top marketing official .
wsj_1288	0	Japan 's Big Four securities firms posted first-half unconsolidated results that mirrored softer performance as a result of slower turnover on the Tokyo Stock Exchange during July and August .
wsj_1288	1	Figures for the period ended Sept. 30 for the four largest brokerage firms -- Nomura Securities Co. , Daiwa Securities Co. , Yamaichi Securities Co. and Nikko Securities -- also reflected a changeover to a fiscal year ending March 31 , replacing the 12-month term formerly finishing Sept. 30 .
wsj_1288	2	As a result , brokerage house officials said , appropriate comparisons from the same period a year earlier were unavailable .
wsj_1288	3	Operating profit , pretax profit and net income results , however , were provided for the immediately preceding six-month period .
wsj_1288	4	The statistics follow a year-on-year rebound in consolidated and unconsolidated results in the full fiscal year ended in March 1989 , recovering from dismal results in the prior fiscal year as a result of the October 1987 stock market crash .
wsj_1288	5	Nomura said its pretax profits inched up 0.9 % to 248.91 billion yen US$ 1.75 billion from 246.60 billion yen in the six months ended March 31 .
wsj_1288	6	Total operating profit fell 3.1 % to 486.1 billion yen from 501.61 billion yen .
wsj_1288	7	Net income , however , rose 3.7 % to 107.87 billion yen from 103.98 billion yen .
wsj_1288	8	Per-share net rose to 55.10 yen from 54.51 yen .
wsj_1288	9	Daiwa said its pretax profits surged 9.6 % to 171.04 billion yen from 156.12 billion yen in the preceding six-month term .
wsj_1288	10	Operating profit rose 5.5 % to 332.38 billion yen from 315.12 billion yen .
wsj_1288	11	Net income jumped 21 % to 79.03 billion yen from 65.53 billion yen .
wsj_1288	12	Per-share net rose to 62.04 yen from 51.50 yen .
wsj_1288	13	Yamaichi said its pretax profit increased 8.9 % to 117.94 billion yen from 108.28 billion yen .
wsj_1288	14	Operating profit rose 5.3 % to 279.75 billion yen from 265.79 billion yen .
wsj_1288	15	Net income surged 21 % to 55.59 billion yen from 46.02 billion yen .
wsj_1288	16	Per-share net rose to 47.46 yen from 39.31 yen .
wsj_1288	17	Nikko 's pretax profit rose 1.6 % to 130.25 billion yen from 128.19 billion yen .
wsj_1288	18	Operating profit rose 4 % to 293.29 billion yen from 282.08 billion yen .
wsj_1288	19	Net income rose 23 % to 63.52 billion yen from 51.65 billion yen .
wsj_1288	20	Per-share net rose to 44.08 yen from 36.13 yen .
wsj_1289	0	Harken Energy Corp. of Dallas said it will drop its $ 11.75-a-share , or $ 190 million , offer for Tesoro Petroleum Corp. if the two companies do n't have an agreement to merge by Dec. 15 .
wsj_1289	1	Harken , which made its offer in August , said it still is awaiting a response to its offer from Tesoro 's board .
wsj_1289	2	Harken also said that its financing from Bankers Trust Co. has been extended until Dec. 15 to give Tesoro 's board time to consider the offer at a Tesoro board meeting scheduled for mid-November .
wsj_1289	3	Harken , which owns about 800 retail gas stations , has said it is particularly interested in Tesoro 's refinery because it would fill a gap in its business .
wsj_1289	4	However , Tesoro , based in Houston , already has rejected a suitor in the past year .
wsj_1290	0	Francis D. John , 35-year-old president , will assume the additional job of chief executive officer .
wsj_1290	1	He succeeds Paul J. Montle , 42 , who will remain chairman .
wsj_1290	2	National Environmental also said it will move its headquarters from Hingham to Folcroft , Pa. , the site of its sludge dewatering facility .
wsj_1290	3	National Environmental , formerly Yankee Cos. , is a sludge treatment company .
wsj_1291	0	Eagle Clothes Inc. , which is operating under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code , said it reached an agreement with its creditors .
wsj_1291	1	Under the accord , Albert Roth , chairman and chief executive officer , and Arthur Chase , Sam Beigel , and Louis Polsky will resign as officers and directors of the menswear retailer .
wsj_1291	2	Mr. Roth , who has been on leave from his posts , will be succeeded by Geoffrie D. Lurie of GDL Management Inc. , which is Eagle 's crisis manager .
wsj_1291	3	Mr. Lurie is currently co-chief executive .
wsj_1291	4	Arnold Levine , acting co-chief executive , will continue as senior vice president and a board member .
wsj_1291	5	Eagle also said it received a commitment for as much as $ 8 million in financing from Norfolk Capital Group Inc .
wsj_1291	6	In addition , a Norfolk affiliate , York Capital Inc. , will purchase all of the interests of Eagle 's secured lenders , which total $ 11.5 million , and guarantee as much as $ 8.2 million in payments to Eagle 's unsecured creditors .
wsj_1291	7	A committee representing the unsecured creditors agreed to accept 24 cents on the dollar , Eagle said .
wsj_1291	8	The plan would extend the period under which Eagle has the exclusive right to file a reorganization plan .
wsj_1291	9	It would extinguish all of Eagle 's existing capital stock and issue new stock to York as sole holder .
wsj_1291	10	A bankruptcy court hearing is set for Nov. 3 on these accords .
wsj_1291	11	In its bankruptcy-law petition , filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan , Eagle said its problems began in 1987 and early 1988 when its then-senior lender , Bankers Trust Co. , reduced its credit line .
wsj_1291	12	In September 1988 , Eagle acquired Biny Clothing Inc. , a closely held New York chain operated under the Bonds name .
wsj_1291	13	Eagle 's management retired and Biny 's management took control of the company .
wsj_1291	14	At the time , Eagle reached a new credit agreement with Bankers Trust and with Bank Leumi Trust Co. of New York for $ 8 million , and a new subordinated debt accord with First Century Partners and Biny management for $ 2 million .
wsj_1291	15	But Eagle said the financing was insufficient and sales during the past fiscal year sagged .

wsj_1292	2	American Medical is being acquired .
wsj_1293	0	The tougher new regulations under the savings-and-loan bailout law are accelerating the thrift industry 's shrinking act .
wsj_1293	1	Largely to meet tougher new capital requirements , thrifts reduced their assets $ 13.4 billion in August , by selling such assets as mortgage-backed securities and loans .
wsj_1293	2	Industry assets as of Aug. 31 were $ 1.31 trillion , the lowest since August 1988 .
wsj_1293	3	As thrifts sell assets to improve their capital-to-asset ratio , as required under the new law passed in August , they must also reduce liabilities , such as deposits .
wsj_1293	4	As interest rates paid depositors were lowered , thrift withdrawals exceeded deposits by $ 5.1 billion , not including interest credited to accounts .
wsj_1293	5	It was the third consecutive month in which thrifts shed assets to increase the size of their capital in relation to their assets , the Office of Thrift Supervision said .
wsj_1293	6	The asset shrinkage was particularly concentrated in several large California institutions .
wsj_1293	7	`` The downsizing of the thrift industry is well under way , '' said Bert Ely , an industry consultant in Alexandria , Va .
wsj_1293	8	`` This suggests the bailout law is having a more dramatic effect than anyone would have imagined so soon . ''
wsj_1293	9	James Barth , an economist with the Office of Thrift Supervision , also attributed some of the outflow to seasonal factors .
wsj_1293	10	`` August is a month when people are paying school tuition , '' he said .
wsj_1293	11	`` That and adjustment to the new law were the biggest factors in the industry . ''
wsj_1293	12	Not including thrifts under government conservatorship , S&Ls reduced their assets by $ 10.1 billion from the previous month , and deposit outflows totaled $ 3.9 billion .
wsj_1293	13	For the 264 insolvent thrifts under government management at the end of August , assets declined by $ 3.3 billion and withdrawals exceeded deposits by $ 1.2 billion .
wsj_1293	14	Thrifts raised capital mostly by selling mortgages and mortgage-backed securities , which were reduced by $ 7.8 billion in August from the prior month .
wsj_1293	15	As of Aug. 31 , thrifts held $ 185 billion in mortgage-backed securities .
wsj_1293	16	The deposit numbers for August marked a swing back to huge outflows after a July net deposit inflow of $ 54 million -- the only net inflow in more than a year .
wsj_1293	17	Deposits are n't expected to exceed withdrawals in the foreseeable future , as the industry continues to shrink .
wsj_1293	18	`` I think we are going to see deposit shrinkage continue , unless we see big changes in rates , '' Mr. Ely said .
wsj_1293	19	For the first eight months of 1989 , thrifts ' withdrawals exceeded deposits by $ 44.5 billion .
wsj_1293	20	For the prior year , deposits exceeded withdrawals by $ 8.8 billion .
wsj_1295	0	Union Carbide Corp. said third-quarter net income plunged 35 % from a year earlier on weakness in the company 's mainstay chemicals and plastics business .
wsj_1295	1	Net was $ 139 million , or 98 cents a share , for the quarter , compared with $ 213 million , or $ 1.56 a share , a year ago .
wsj_1295	2	Sales were $ 2.14 billion , up 1.6 % from $ 2.11 billion the previous year .
wsj_1295	3	Carbide , like other companies with a heavy reliance on the so-called commodity end of the chemicals industry , was expected to post earnings sharply lower than in an exceptionally strong 1988 third quarter .
wsj_1295	4	But the company 's latest quarter was a few pennies a share lower than the more pessimistic projections on Wall Street .
wsj_1295	5	`` It certainly was n't a disaster , but it does show weakness '' in some of the company 's chief markets , said George Krug , a chemicals-industry analyst at Oppenheimer & Co .
wsj_1295	6	In New York Stock Exchange composite trading , Carbide closed at $ 24.50 a share , down 50 cents .
wsj_1295	7	Prices for polyethylene , a common plastic and an important Carbide product , started to fall early this year ; the slide accelerated in the third quarter as buyers continued to trim inventories .
wsj_1295	8	Prices also fell for ethylene oxide and glycols , products used in making antifreeze .
wsj_1295	9	Some producers of polyethylene , figuring the inventory reductions are near an end , have announced price boosts .
wsj_1295	10	The first real test of whether prices have hit bottom may come in the next several weeks , when the new prices become effective .
wsj_1295	11	A Carbide spokesman said `` the conditions are right for the increase to hold . ''
wsj_1295	12	For the third quarter , operating profit from Carbide 's chemicals and plastics business fell to $ 238 million from $ 352 million a year ago , before accounting for taxes and interest expense .
wsj_1295	13	Operating profit from carbon products , such as graphite electrodes , also declined , to $ 6 million from $ 20 million .
wsj_1295	14	In the industrial-gases segment , operating profit climbed to $ 87 million from $ 58 million .
wsj_1295	15	The latest quarter included a gain of about $ 62 million on the sale of the company 's urethane polyols and propylene glycols businesses .
wsj_1295	16	Propylene glycols are used in making personal-care products such as shampoo , and urethane polyols are used in making the polyurethane foam found in furniture cushioning and other products .
wsj_1295	17	That gain was mostly offset by a loss of about $ 55 million from a write-down in its polysilicon business .
wsj_1295	18	Polysilicon is used in making integrated circuits .
wsj_1295	19	For the nine months , net totaled $ 526 million , or $ 3.74 a share , up 5 % from $ 501 million , or $ 3.71 a share , a year ago .
wsj_1295	20	Sales rose 7.7 % to $ 6.66 billion from $ 6.19 billion .
wsj_1298	0	Robert J. Penn , president and chief executive officer , will take early retirement from this steelmaker Dec 31 .
wsj_1298	1	William S. Leavitt , chairman , said Mr. Penn , 58 years old , would continue as a consultant and would work with the board in selecting a successor .
wsj_1298	2	UNR recently emerged from bankruptcy-law proceedings that left 64 % of the reorganized company 's common stock in the hands of trustees of an asbestos-disease claims trust .
wsj_1298	3	The company said it would have no further comment .
wsj_1298	4	Mr. Leavitt , 37 , was elected chairman earlier this year by the company 's new board , having served as vice president for legal and corporate affairs .
wsj_1298	5	His father , David S. Leavitt , was chairman and chief executive until his death in an accident five years ago , at which time Mr. Penn was named president .
wsj_1299	0	Some House Democrats are trying to head off an appointment by President Bush to the board that oversees the savings-and-loan bailout , contending that the prospective nominee is the head of troubled banks himself .
wsj_1299	1	Four Democrats on the House Banking Committee sent President Bush a letter stating their concerns about the expected appointment of James Simmons , an Arizona banker and former fund-raiser for Mr. Bush , to the Oversight Board of the Resolution Trust Corp .
wsj_1299	2	The Oversight Board , created in the savings-and-loan law signed in August , sets policy for the RTC , which will sell hundreds of the nation 's sick thrifts and billions of dollars of their assets .
wsj_1299	3	Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady , Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp are members of the board .
wsj_1299	4	President Bush must appoint two other members , one a Democrat and one a Republican .
wsj_1299	5	An administration official confirmed last week that Mr. Simmons , the chairman of Valley National Bank in Phoenix , is the Republican appointee , and that a security clearance was under way .
wsj_1299	6	The Democratic appointee has n't been determined , the official said .
wsj_1299	7	Mr. Simmons declined to comment , and the White House said the congressmen 's letter is under review .
wsj_1299	8	The letter , dated last Thursday , cited the losses at Valley National , and at United Bank , also of Phoenix , where Mr. Simmons was chairman for 29 years .
wsj_1299	9	Both banks have been battered , as have other Arizona banks , by falling real estate prices .
wsj_1299	10	Valley National , for example , had $ 470 million in problem assets as of June .
wsj_1299	11	`` We believe that there are numerous other candidates more qualified for this important position and we encourage you to give them your thorough consideration before making this key RTC appointment , '' the letter said .
wsj_1299	12	`` The RTC needs the most able , competent management available . ''
wsj_1299	13	But Mr. Simmons has long ties to both Republicans and banking .
wsj_1299	14	He was co-chairman of Mr. Bush 's Arizona campaign committee in last year 's election , and also worked for Mr. Bush in the 1980 election .
wsj_1299	15	The two met more than 30 years ago , when Mr. Simmons worked for Commercial Bank & Trust Co. of Midland , Texas , where Mr. Bush was an organizing director .
wsj_1299	16	In 1986 , Mr. Simmons also served on a committee of businessmen headed by William Seidman , chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Resolution Trust Corp .
wsj_1299	17	That committee determined to open Arizona to banking across state lines .
wsj_1299	18	Arizona Trend magazine referred to Mr. Simmons this year as one of the 25 most influential people in the state .
wsj_1299	19	The letter to Mr. Bush was signed by Reps. Bruce Vento D. , Minn. , the chairman of the Banking Committee 's RTC Task Force , Thomas McMillen D. , Md. , Kweisi Mfume D. , Md . and Paul Kanjorski D. , Pa . .
wsj_1300	0	Randolph W. McElroy , a vice chairman of this bank-holding company , was named to the additional position of chairman of its principal unit , Sovran Bank .
wsj_1300	1	Mr. McElroy , 54 years old , will remain president and chief executive officer of the unit .
wsj_1300	2	Sovran also named John B. Werner a vice chairman of the parent company and the unit and elected him to the newly created position of chief credit officer of Sovran Financial , increasing the number of corporate board members to 35 .
wsj_1300	3	Mr. Werner , 58 , was formerly senior executive vice president of the parent company and the unit .
wsj_1301	0	Moody 's Investors Service Inc. said it lowered the debt ratings of certain long-term debt held by this company .
wsj_1301	1	The debt-rating concern cited the bank 's move into the Texas market , noting its profitability and capital adequacy measurements will be depressed relative to the bank 's past performance .
wsj_1301	2	Moody 's also said it raised its rating on the Deposit Insurance Bridge Bank , now known as Bank One , Texas N.A. , reflecting the support of other banking affiliates and substantial assistance for the FDIC .
wsj_1301	3	Officials at the New York bank-holding company were n't available for comment on the debt-rating changes .
wsj_1304	0	Inco Ltd. posted a 35 % decline in third-quarter net income , a performance that was in line with analysts ' expectations .
wsj_1304	1	The nickel producer also raised its quarterly dividend to 25 cents a share from 20 cents and said it may buy back as much as 4.8 % of its common outstanding .
wsj_1304	2	Inco shares fell after the announcements .
wsj_1304	3	Analysts said some investors were disappointed that the cash-rich company had failed to announce a special dividend .
wsj_1304	4	Inco closed at $ 31.125 a share , down 62.5 cents , in New York Stock Exchange composite trading .
wsj_1304	5	Some analysts said Inco , which had cash reserves of $ 272 million as of Sept. 30 , could still announce a special dividend in the next few months , though it would be smaller than the $ 10-a-share special dividend it paid last year .
wsj_1304	6	The quarterly dividend is payable Dec. 1 to shares of record Nov. 3 .
wsj_1304	7	Inco 's net fell to $ 129.3 million , or $ 1.23 a share , in the third quarter from $ 200.3 million , or $ 1.88 a share , a year earlier .
wsj_1304	8	Sales rose 8.2 % to $ 848.7 million from $ 784.5 million .
wsj_1304	9	Excluding special gains from tax-loss carry-forwards , earnings in the latest quarter were $ 117.7 million , or $ 1.12 a share , compared with $ 187.4 million , or $ 1.76 a share .
wsj_1304	10	Inco said the drop in earnings resulted mainly from lower nickel prices for the period and a temporary cut in nickel output at the company 's Manitoba operations due to high levels of arsenic in the ore .
wsj_1304	11	Inco said it plans to buy back as many as five million common shares over the next 12 months if nickel market conditions are favorable .
wsj_1304	12	Under a previous buyback program , Inco has purchased 1.7 million of its shares since April .
wsj_1305	0	UAL Corp. 's board quashed any prospects for an immediate revival of a labor-management buy-out , saying United Airlines ' parent should remain independent for now .
wsj_1305	1	As a result , UAL 's chairman , Stephen M. Wolf , pulled out of the buy-out effort to focus on running the company .
wsj_1305	2	The two developments put the acquisition attempt back to square one and leaves the airline with an array of unresolved matters , including an unsettled labor situation and a management scrambling to restore its damaged credibility .
wsj_1305	3	The effort to create the nation 's largest employee-owned company began unraveling Oct. 13 when the labor-management group was unable to obtain financing for its $ 300-a-share , $ 6.79 billion offer .
wsj_1305	4	Just last week it suffered another major setback when British Airways PLC , the largest equity investor in the labor-management bid , withdrew its support .
wsj_1305	5	Takeover stock traders , focusing on the company 's intention to stay independent , took the announcement as bad news .
wsj_1305	6	UAL , which had risen $ 9.875 to $ 178.375 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange on reports of a new bid being prepared by the group , reversed course and plummeted in off-exchange trading after the 5:09 p.m. EDT announcement .
wsj_1305	7	Among the first trades reported by the securities firm of Jefferies & Co. , which makes a market in UAL after the exchange is closed , were 10,000 shares at $ 170 , 6,000 shares at $ 162 , 2,500 at $ 162 , and 10,000 at $ 158 .
wsj_1305	8	The rebound in UAL stock during regular trading hours Monday was its first daily gain after six consecutive losses left the price 41 % below its level before Oct. 13 , the day the group announced the bank financing could n't be obtained for the original deal .
wsj_1305	9	Twelve of UAL 's outside directors met at a five-hour meeting yesterday in Chicago to consider an informal proposal from the buy-out group for a revised bid .
wsj_1305	10	But the board said it was n't interested for now .
wsj_1305	11	That proposal , valued at between $ 225 and $ 240 a share , would have transferred majority ownership to employees while leaving some stock in public hands .
wsj_1305	12	The buy-out group had no firm financing for the plan .
wsj_1305	13	And , with no other offers on the table , the board apparently felt no pressure to act on it .
wsj_1305	14	The directors signaled , however , that they would be willing to consider future offers or take some other action to maximize shareholder value , saying they would continue to explore `` all strategic and financial alternatives . ''
wsj_1305	15	But it was clear that for the time being , the board wants the company to return to normalcy .
wsj_1305	16	The board said it concluded that `` the welfare of the company , its shareholders , its employees and the broader public ... can best be enhanced by continued development of UAL as a strong , viable , independent company . ''
wsj_1305	17	Mr. Wolf urged all employees to `` now turn their full attention '' to operating the airline .
wsj_1305	18	He also vowed to `` make every effort to nurture ... a constructive new relationship that has been forged with participating employee groups . ''
wsj_1305	19	But Mr. Wolf faces a monumental task in pulling the company back together again .
wsj_1305	20	Labor problems top the list .
wsj_1305	21	For a brief time , the buy-out effort seemed to solve his problems with United 's pilot union .
wsj_1305	22	In return for an ownership stake in the company , the pilots were willing to agree to a seven-year contract that included a no-strike clause and significant wage concessions and productivity gains the union previously resisted .
wsj_1305	23	That contract was tied to the success of the buy-out .
wsj_1305	24	As a `` good-will measure , '' the pilots had been working four extra hours a month and had agreed to fly UAL 's two new Boeing 747-400 aircraft .
wsj_1305	25	It 's uncertain if the pilots will continue to do so without a contract settlement .
wsj_1305	26	The union said late last night that it is still committed to majority employee ownership and that the labor disputes that faced the company prior to the buy-out effort `` still need to be addressed . ''
wsj_1305	27	The buy-out effort also worsened already-strained relations between United 's pilot and machinist unions .
wsj_1305	28	The machinists ' criticisms of the labor-management bid and their threats of a strike unless they received substantial wage increases this year helped cool banks ' interest in financing the transaction .
wsj_1305	29	The machinists previously had shown themselves to be an ally to Mr. Wolf , but he lost much of his credibility with that group when he teamed up with the pilot union .
wsj_1305	30	The machinists criticized the terms Mr. Wolf and management received in the buy-out .
wsj_1305	31	They paid $ 15 million for a 1 % stake and received an additional 9 % of the company at no additional cost .
wsj_1305	32	His credibility is also on the line in the investment community .
wsj_1305	33	Until the collapse of this bid , Mr. Wolf was regarded as one of the nation 's savviest airline executives after engineering turnarounds of Tiger International Inc. and Republic Airlines .
wsj_1305	34	But he and his chief financial officer , John Pope , sowed some of the seeds for the deal 's failure by insisting banks accept low financing fees and interest rates , while they invested in the transaction only a small fraction of the $ 114.3 million they stood to gain from sale of their UAL stock and options .
wsj_1305	35	The board 's actions leave takeover stock traders nursing some $ 700 million in losses and eager to respond to anyone who might make a new offer .
wsj_1305	36	It also inevitably leaves a residue of shareholder lawsuits .
wsj_1305	37	Arbitragers said they were disappointed the company did n't announce some recapitalization or other plan to maximize value .
wsj_1305	38	One takeover expert noted that arbitragers could force a recapitalization through the written consent process under which holders may oust the board by a majority vote .
wsj_1305	39	The machinists union has suggested it may propose a recapitalization that includes a special dividend for holders and a minority ownership stake for employees .
wsj_1305	40	Los Angeles investor Marvin Davis , whose $ 240-a-share offer for UAL in August triggered a bidding war , says he remains interested in the airline .
wsj_1305	41	However , he is restricted from making certain hostile moves by an agreement he signed to obtain confidential UAL data .
wsj_1305	42	Essentially , he ca n't make any hostile moves unless he makes a tender offer at least $ 300 a share .
wsj_1308	0	We 've heard California 's property-tax-cutting Proposition 13 blamed for a lot over the years , but ABC 's Ted Koppel came up with a new wrinkle in his earthquake coverage last week when he asked Democratic Assemblyman Richard Katz if Prop. 13 had withheld money needed for road maintenance .
wsj_1308	1	Mr. Katz happily agreed , sliding over the fact that California 's roads and bridges are n't funded by property taxes but by state and federal gasoline taxes .
wsj_1308	2	Both have been raised at least 30 % in recent years , even while the price of gasoline has fallen .
wsj_1308	3	Dragging Prop. 13 into this story is a pretty long stretch .
wsj_1309	0	A series of explosions tore through the huge Phillips Petroleum Co. plastics plant near here , injuring more than a hundred and closing parts of the Houston Ship Channel .
wsj_1309	1	There were no immediate reports of deaths , but officials said a number of workers were still unaccounted for last night .
wsj_1309	2	The Bartlesville , Okla. , oil company late yesterday still had n't said officially what caused the explosions and fires , which sent columns of heavy black smoke billowing high into the air .
wsj_1309	3	One local Phillips manager said a seal blew in one of the plant 's reactors .
wsj_1309	4	Glenn Cox , Phillips ' president and chief operating officer , and other Phillips officials flew from Bartlesville to assess the damage and determine the cause of the afternoon explosions .
wsj_1309	5	In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange , Phillips Petroleum shares fell $ 1.125 to $ 23.125 .
wsj_1309	6	The plastics plant is located on an 800-acre tract in the heart of the petrochemical corridor that reaches along the U.S. Gulf Coast .
wsj_1309	7	The U.S. Coast Guard closed six miles of the Houston Ship Channel , where about 150 companies have operations , because the thick , black smoke obscured the area .
wsj_1309	8	The Port of Houston closed its terminal for handling bulk cargo .
wsj_1309	9	Broken water lines and gas leaks hindered firefighters ' efforts , but by late yesterday authorities said they had the fire under control .
wsj_1309	10	The blasts blew out windows , spewed debris for miles and crumpled the ceiling in an area elementary school .
wsj_1309	11	The initial fireball was caught by cameras in downtown Houston , about 10 miles away .
wsj_1309	12	Nearby Pasadena , Texas , police reported that 104 people had been taken to area hospitals , but a spokeswoman said that toll could rise .
wsj_1309	13	The injured , including three in critical condition , were treated for burns , breathing problems and cuts from flying glass , hospital officials said .
wsj_1309	14	The plant employs between 800 and 900 on three shifts .
wsj_1309	15	The number working at the time of the blast was n't known .
wsj_1309	16	Yesterday 's explosions were the second round in two months at the plastics plant .
wsj_1309	17	In late August , four contract workers were injured and one Phillips employee died after an explosion at a fuel supply line near the facility 's boiler house .
wsj_1309	18	The Phillips facility manufactures polyethylene , polypropylene and K-resin , plastics used in a wide array of applications , including milk jugs and toys .
wsj_1309	19	Plastics are the cornerstone of Phillips ' chemicals operations , which is the biggest single contributor to the company 's profits .
wsj_1310	0	A federal judge in Manhattan has entered a judgment requiring a Chicago organized crime figure to pay the government $ 250,000 , representing alleged profits he gained from his involvement with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters .
wsj_1310	1	Manhattan U.S. Attorney Otto Obermaier said it was the first time ever that the government had obtained any disgorgement from an organized crime figure indicted under the civil racketeering law .
wsj_1310	2	Joseph Lombardo , who the government alleged was the `` captain '' of organized crime in Chicago , was one of numerous defendants in the government 's sweeping racketeering suit against the Teamsters .
wsj_1310	3	In the suit , filed in June 1988 , the government accused the union 's leadership of depriving its 1.6 million members of their rights through a pattern of racketeering .
wsj_1310	4	Among other things , the government claimed that organized crime figures had routinely handpicked the union 's top officials .
wsj_1310	5	U.S. District Judge David Edelstein also permanently enjoined Mr. Lombardo from any future dealings with the Teamsters or any other labor union .
wsj_1310	6	Mr. Lombardo , the last of the defendants to settle the suit , agreed to pay the government the $ 250,000 within one week .

wsj_1313	1	Morton Downey Jr. , who self-destructed as a talk-show host and frequently verbally abused his guests , has been signed to co-host a half-hour nightly program on the Consumer News and Business Channel , the cable channel partly owned by the General Electric Co. 's National Broadcasting Co .
wsj_1313	2	The premiere of `` Showdown , '' with Mr. Downey and Richard G. Carter , a columnist with the New York Daily News , is scheduled for Dec. 4 at 8 p.m .
wsj_1313	3	CNBC is available to 13 million cable households .
wsj_1313	4	Mr. Downey said he is not going to change his style , which some critics said was flamboyant and others deemed offensive .
wsj_1313	5	`` But I 'm going to proceed in a more logical way .
wsj_1313	6	I 'm not going to do anything that is not acceptable in anyone 's home .
wsj_1313	7	But that does n't mean I 'm not going to get angry . ''
wsj_1313	8	Michael Eskridge , president of CNBC , said that although there will be a studio audience , viewers will no longer have to endure the shouting of `` Mort ! Mort ! Mort ! ''
wsj_1313	9	But just how does Mr. Downey 's unorthodox style mesh with the sedate tone of CNBC 's business programming ?
wsj_1313	10	`` Ninety percent of Mort 's old show fits into our style , '' said Mr. Eskridge .
wsj_1313	11	`` That is consumer issues . ''
wsj_1313	12	Mr. Downey 's previous show , a one-hour shout fest , syndciated by MCA Inc. and produced by Quantum Media Inc. , was canceled in July after advertisers and stations abandoned it .
wsj_1316	0	Ingersoll Publications Co. agreed to buy the New Haven Register in a transaction valued at $ 275 million from Goodson Newspaper Group Inc .
wsj_1316	1	As part of the agreement , Goodson also terminated the contract under which Ingersoll manages Goodson 's 66 newspapers , ending a long association between the two companies that has turned increasingly bitter recently .
wsj_1316	2	Goodson has accused Ingersoll of paying less attention to its properties and more to such ventures as the recent launch of the St. Louis Sun .
wsj_1316	3	Under the terms of the accord , Ingersoll will pay about $ 255 million for the Register , a daily that Goodson bought for about $ 170 million in 1986 .
wsj_1316	4	Goodson will pay the additional $ 20 million in settlement of the management contract .
wsj_1316	5	Goodson also announced that it hired the former president and senior vice president of Ingersoll to run the Goodson papers .
wsj_1316	6	Both executives left the company after clashes with Chairman Ralph Ingersoll Jr .
wsj_1316	7	Goodson , which is based here , will use part of the proceeds to pay down debt associated with its purchase of the Morristown Daily Record for $ 155 million in 1987 .
wsj_1316	8	The New Jersey paper , like the New Haven , Conn. , paper , was purchased by Ingersoll on Goodson 's behalf as part of the management contract .
wsj_1316	9	Industry analysts have said that the purchase price for the paper was too high , causing a strain on Goodson 's finances .
wsj_1316	10	Investment bankers familiar with the company said Goodson is seeking a new bank credit line of $ 190 million and may have to sell additional newspapers .
wsj_1316	11	David N. Hurwitz , president and chief operating officer of Goodson , said in a telephone interview that the company does n't currently have any plans to sell additional newspapers .
wsj_1316	12	Goodson said David Carr , former president of Ingersoll Publications , and Ray Cockburn , former senior vice president , would head the new in-house management team at Goodson , which had revenue of $ 225 million in 1988 .
wsj_1316	13	The association between the two companies stretches back thirty years to a friendship between television producer Mark Goodson and Ingersoll founder Ralph Ingersoll .
wsj_1316	14	The latter 's son , Ralph Ingersoll Jr. , took over the company and has been managing the Goodson properties and acting as an agent in the purchase of newspapers for Goodson .
wsj_1316	15	But in recent years , Mr. Ingersoll began focusing more on expanding his own newspaper empire in partnership with investment banking firm Warburg , Pincus & Co .
wsj_1316	16	Ingersoll has 28 dailies and 200 other non-daily papers in the U.S. and Europe .
wsj_1316	17	The company said its revenue will exceed $ 750 million this year .
wsj_1316	18	Ingersoll President Robert M. Jelenic said in a statement that the company is `` delighted by the conclusion of the Goodson relationship '' and will be able to `` concentrate all our energies '' on Ingersoll 's own papers .
wsj_1316	19	Mr. Goodson , in his own statement , was less upbeat , saying `` unfortunately over the past few years , it has become increasingly clear that Ralph and I have different agendas , '' and that he feels `` more comfortable with a management team whose sole interest and responsibility is in the Goodson papers .
wsj_1319	0	In a sign the stock slump has n't quieted Europe 's takeover fever , Cie . Financiere de Paribas said it intends to bid for one of France 's other large financial and industrial holding companies , Cie. de Navigation Mixte .
wsj_1319	1	Paribas said that once it receives the go-ahead from French stock market authorities , it will offer to boost its Navigation Mixte stake to 66.7 % from the current 18.7 % .
wsj_1319	2	Its cash-or-shares bid values Navigation Mixte at about 22.82 billion francs $ 3.62 billion , making this one of France 's largest-ever attempted takeovers .
wsj_1319	3	The cost of buying the additional 48 % stake would be 10.95 billion francs $ 1.74 billion .
wsj_1319	4	The move would greatly boost Paribas 's stake in the insurance , transport and food businesses , where Navigation Mixte is strong .
wsj_1319	5	It also would make Paribas a major French ally of West Germany 's Allianz AG insurance group .
wsj_1319	6	Allianz holds a 50 % stake in Navigation Mixte 's insurance interests , acquired three weeks ago .
wsj_1319	7	Those include Rhin et Moselle Vie and Via Assurances .
wsj_1319	8	Long considered a potential takeover target , Navigation Mixte had hoped Allianz would help protect it from raiders .
wsj_1319	9	That idea may have backfired .
wsj_1319	10	Paribas is Allianz 's main French bank , and the Munich-based group said it intends to stay neutral .
wsj_1319	11	Navigation Mixte said it would n't have any comment until its board meets Wednesday .
wsj_1319	12	But Navigation Mixte is loosely held and hard to defend .
wsj_1319	13	`` The defensive options are limited , '' says Philippe Braye , a partner in portfolio management concern France Finance Quatre .
wsj_1319	14	`` Who would bid against Paribas ? ''
wsj_1319	15	If the Paribas bid succeeds , it will be the second time in two months a big French investment banking group has snapped up an insurance group .
wsj_1319	16	Last month , Paribas 's archrival , Cie . Financiere de Suez , won a battle for Groupe Victoire , France 's second-largest private-sector insurer , which itself had just acquired West Germany 's Colonia Versicherung AG .
wsj_1319	17	That complex bid was billed as France 's largest takeover ever this one is slightly smaller .
wsj_1319	18	Moreover , Suez had just finished winning an even larger battle last year for control of Societe Generale de Belgique .
wsj_1319	19	Paribas officials , once considered France 's toughest bankers , felt abashed at Suez 's success and its rapid growth .
wsj_1319	20	Although Paribas denies it , analysts say the new bid in part simply reflects the continuing rivalry between France 's two largest investment banking groups .
wsj_1319	21	It also reflects the broader pressure on companies in Europe to keep up as the European Community prepares to reduce internal trade barriers by 1992 .
wsj_1319	22	Although Paribas Chairman Michel Francois-Poncet would n't rule out eventually selling all of Navigation Mixte 's insurance operations to Allianz , he stressed the potential for the two groups instead to cooperate .
wsj_1319	23	He also told reporters the acquisition would give Paribas fresh diversity , bringing it properties in food and transport where it has been weak .
wsj_1319	24	Navigation Mixte has investments in a sugar company , a food and canning concern , a bakery and bus and trucking firms , among others .
wsj_1319	25	And Navigation Mixte has a huge hidden attraction .
wsj_1319	26	Payment by Allianz for the insurance interests it has just bought will help swell the French concern 's treasury to an estimated 11 billion francs .
wsj_1319	27	Paribas said it will bid 1,850 francs a share for Navigation Mixte shares that qualify for a full yearly dividend , and 1,800 francs for those created July 1 , which are eligible for partial dividends .
wsj_1319	28	Alternatively , it said it would offer three Paribas shares , themselves eligible for dividends as of next Jan. 1 , for one Navigation Mixte share .
wsj_1319	29	Paribas shares closed down 30 francs at 610 francs , and Navigation Mixte shares were suspended at 1,800 francs pending the outcome of the bid .
wsj_1319	30	Paribas said it would publish details of its bid once authorities clear it .
wsj_1319	31	This is one of the first bids under new takeover rules aimed at encouraging open bids instead of gradual accumulation of large stakes .
wsj_1319	32	Some financial sources said privately that Paribas blundered in failing to move sooner for the insurance and industrial group , bidding only after speculation had pushed up the price .
wsj_1319	33	Mr. Francois-Poncet responded that his group initially intended to take only a minority stake , striking an alliance with current management .
wsj_1319	34	When notoriously independent-minded Navigation Mixte Chairman Marc Fournier rejected Paribas 's offer and began buying Paribas shares in retaliation , Mr. Francois-Poncet said , he felt obliged to bid for control .
wsj_1319	35	He told reporters he had information that Mr. Fournier was preparing to buy as much as 20 % of Paribas , up from less than 5 % currently .
wsj_1319	36	A bid against Paribas could n't be ruled out .
wsj_1319	37	France 's second-largest government-owned insurance company , Assurances Generales de France , has been building its own Navigation Mixte stake , currently thought to be between 8 % and 10 % .
wsj_1319	38	Analysts said they do n't think it is contemplating a takeover , however , and its officials could n't be reached .
wsj_1320	0	Crude oil futures prices fell further as analysts and traders said OPEC oil producers are n't putting the brakes on output ahead of the traditionally weak first quarter .
wsj_1320	1	In trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange , the U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude fell 39 cents a barrel to $ 19.76 for December delivery .
wsj_1320	2	Petroleum products prices also declined .
wsj_1320	3	Analysts pointed to reports that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is producing substantially more than its official limit of 20.5 million barrels a day , with some accounts putting the 13-nation group 's output as high as 23 million barrels a day .
wsj_1320	4	That level of production did n't take its toll on futures prices for the fourth quarter , when demand is traditionally strong .
wsj_1320	5	But because first-quarter demand is normally the weakest of the year , several market participants say , OPEC production will have to decline to keep prices from eroding further .
wsj_1320	6	The group plans to meet in a month to discuss production strategy for early 1990 .
wsj_1320	7	With prices already headed lower , news of a series of explosions at a major Phillips Petroleum Co. chemical facility on the Houston Ship Channel also was bearish for prices .
wsj_1320	8	Even though such facilities use a relatively small amount of crude , analysts say , now the facility wo n't need any , at a time of already high availability .
wsj_1320	9	The Phillips plant makes polyethylene , polypropylene and other plastic products .
wsj_1320	10	A company official said the explosions began when a seal blew out .
wsj_1320	11	Dozens of workers were injured , authorities said .
wsj_1320	12	There was no immediate estimate of damage from the company .
wsj_1320	13	Some petroleum futures traders say technical considerations now will help to put downward pressure on futures prices .
wsj_1320	14	For instance , one trader said that prices inevitably will go lower now that they 've fallen below $ 20 a barrel .
wsj_1320	15	`` Our technician is a little bearish now that we 've taken out $ 20 , '' he said .
wsj_1320	16	In other commodity markets yesterday :
wsj_1320	17	The selling that started on Friday continued yesterday .
wsj_1320	18	The December contract fell 3.85 cents a pound to $ 1.1960 .
wsj_1320	19	London Metal Exchange warehouse stocks were down only 4,800 metric tons for the week to 84,500 tons ; expectations late last week were a drop of 10,000 to 15,000 tons .
wsj_1320	20	The New York market made its high for the day on the opening and when it dropped below the $ 1.23-a-pound level , selling picked up as previous buyers bailed out of their positions and aggressive short sellers -- anticipating further declines -- moved in .
wsj_1320	21	Fund selling also picked up at that point .
wsj_1320	22	According to Bernard Savaiko , senior commodity analyst at PaineWebber , the only stability to the market came when short sellers periodically moved in to cover their positions by buying contracts .
wsj_1320	23	This activity produced small rallies , which in turn attracted new short selling .
wsj_1320	24	Mr. Savaiko noted that copper had a steep fall in spite of a weak dollar , which would normally support the U.S. copper market .
wsj_1320	25	Such support usually comes from arbitragers who use a strong British pound to buy copper in New York .
wsj_1320	26	`` The sell-off would probably have been worse if the dollar had been strong , '' he said .
wsj_1320	27	Copper has been stuck in a trading range of $ 1.19 to $ 1.34 .
wsj_1320	28	Mr. Savaiko believes that if copper falls below the bottom of this range the next significant support level will be about $ 1.04 .
wsj_1320	29	Platinum and palladium struggled to maintain their prices all day despite news stories over the weekend that recent cold fusion experiments , which use both metals , showed signs of producing extra heat .
wsj_1320	30	January platinum closed down $ 2.80 an ounce at $ 486.30 , nearly $ 4 above its low for the day .
wsj_1320	31	December palladium was off $ 1.55 an ounce at $ 137.20 .
wsj_1320	32	Platinum is believed to have good support around $ 480 and palladium at around $ 130 .
wsj_1320	33	Some traders were thought to be waiting for the auto sales report , which will be released today .
wsj_1320	34	Such sales are watched closely by platinum and palladium traders because both metals are used in automobile catalytic converters .
wsj_1320	35	Mr. Savaiko theorized that the news on cold fusion did n't affect the market yesterday because many traders have already been badly burnt by such stories .
wsj_1320	36	He said the traders are demanding a higher level of proof before they will buy palladium again .
wsj_1320	37	Also weighing on both metals ' prices is the role of the chief supplier , the Soviet Union .
wsj_1320	38	Many analysts believe that the Soviets ' thirst for dollars this year to buy grain and other Western commodities and goods will bring them to the market whenever prices rally very much .
wsj_1320	39	Prices closed mixed as contracts reacted to largely offsetting bullish and bearish news .
wsj_1320	40	On the Chicago Board of Trade , soybeans for November delivery closed at $ 5.63 a bushel , down half a cent , while the December wheat contract rose three-quarters of a cent to $ 4.0775 a bushel .
wsj_1320	41	Supporting prices was the announcement late Friday of additional grain sales to the Soviet Union .
wsj_1320	42	But acting as a drag on prices was the improved harvest weather over the weekend and the prospect for continued fair weather this week over much of the Farm Belt .
wsj_1320	43	Strong farmer selling over the weekend also weighed on prices .
wsj_1320	44	World prices tumbled , mostly from their own weight , according to analysts .
wsj_1320	45	The March contract ended at 13.79 cents a pound , down 0.37 cent .
wsj_1320	46	For the past week or so , traders have been expecting India to buy between 150,000 and 200,000 tons of refined sugar , and there have been expectations of a major purchase by Japan .
wsj_1320	47	But with no reports of either country actually entering the market , analysts said , futures prices became vulnerable .
wsj_1320	48	Developing countries such as India , some analysts said , seem to have made it a point to stay away whenever sugar reached the top of its trading range , around 14.75 cents , and wait for prices to return to the bottom of the range , around 13.50 cents .
wsj_1320	49	But Erik Dunlaevy , a sugar analyst with Balfour Maclaine International Ltd. , said the explanation for the latest drop in sugar prices is much simpler : Speculators , he said , `` got too long too soon and ran into resistance around the old contract highs . ''
wsj_1320	50	A PaineWebber analyst said that in light of a new estimate of a production increase of four million metric tons and only a modest increase in consumption , sugar is n't likely to rise above the top of its trading range without a crop problem in a major producing country .
wsj_1320	51	The December contract rose $ 33 a metric ton to $ 1,027 , near its high for the day .
wsj_1320	52	Gill & Duffus Ltd. , a British cocoa-trading house , estimated that the 1989-90 world cocoa surplus would be 231,000 tons , down from 314,000 tons for the previous year .
wsj_1320	53	Market technicians were encouraged by the price patterns , which in the past have preceded sharp rallies .
wsj_1320	54	Recent prices for cocoa have been near levels last seen in the mid-1970s .
wsj_1320	55	At such prices , according to Mr. Savaiko , bargain hunting and short-covering -- buying back of contracts previously sold -- by speculators is n't uncommon .
wsj_1320	56	But Mr. Savaiko expects stepped-up producer selling at around the $ 1,040 to $ 1,050 level .
wsj_1320	57	He also noted that a strong sterling market yesterday might have helped cocoa in New York as arbitragers took advantage of the currency move .
wsj_1320	58	Sandra Kaul , research analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton , said the market pushed higher mainly in anticipation of a late harvest in the Ivory Coast , a major cocoa producer .
wsj_1321	0	Rockwell International Corp. bought out Ikegai Corp. 's interest in Ikegai-Goss , a joint venture of the two companies based in Tokyo .
wsj_1321	1	The price was 3.6 billion yen $ 25 million .
wsj_1321	2	The agreement provides that Ikegai Corp. will remain a supplier to Ikegai-Goss , which makes printing presses for the newspaper industry .
wsj_1321	3	The purchase was made by Rockwell Graphic Systems , a Chicago subsidiary of the El Segundo , Calif. , concern .
wsj_1321	4	Ikegai-Goss , which has about 200 employees , is among the industry leaders in keyless inking technology , which reduces time and materials waste when preparing a press for printing .
wsj_1323	0	`` The croaker 's done gone from the hook --
wsj_1323	1	My language sure goes to pot down here on the coast . ''
wsj_1323	2	The husky blond guide with the Aggie cap twists his face in mock fury .
wsj_1323	3	`` I got to get back to school and straighten out my English . ''
wsj_1323	4	He has two more years at Texas A&M .
wsj_1323	5	Right now he takes people out to fish in the bays behind the barrier islands that curve for hundreds of miles along the eastern coast of Texas , enclosing milky green lagoons behind ridges of sand and grassy scrub that rim the deep blue of the Gulf beyond .
wsj_1323	6	There have been three days of hot , wind-swept rain , and now with the first sun we are after speckled seatrout , which with redfish provides most of the game fishing hereabouts .
wsj_1323	7	The little radio fizzes as other boats want to see if we have found any fish -- spotting location is everything in this sport .
wsj_1323	8	Negative answers crackle back .
wsj_1323	9	The fish often are plentiful around the pilings of the old gas wells that dot the flat surface like the remains of sunken ships .
wsj_1323	10	We go from one to the other .
wsj_1323	11	The sun is hot now though it 's only 8 in the morning .
wsj_1323	12	The great silver clouds on the horizon build themselves on the pale water .
wsj_1323	13	We cruise toward another set of pilings .
wsj_1323	14	The guide scoops into a pail and puts a frantically wiggling croaker on the hook .
wsj_1323	15	Then he casts out .
wsj_1323	16	`` Just wait for that tap-tap , that thump-thump .
wsj_1323	17	It comes real gentle before it pulls .
wsj_1323	18	Do n't forget , trout have very soft mouths . ''
wsj_1323	19	The radio queries again .
wsj_1323	20	`` Pickin ' one or two , '' says the guide , chuckling .
wsj_1323	21	`` You can tell they 've got nothin ' . ''
wsj_1323	22	A pair of black skimmers zig-zag past close to the surface .
wsj_1323	23	Soon we have our limit of the shimmering fish stippled in rose-gold and black .
wsj_1323	24	And we are the first back at the dock , where the great blue herons stand waiting by the cleaning benches .
wsj_1323	25	The guide is young and he knows this business but he wants a different life after college , such as working for IBM and wearing a necktie .
wsj_1323	26	This must be the last big stretch of the American seacoast that is `` undeveloped . ''
wsj_1323	27	There are a few ramshackle fishing towns with quiet atolls of resort houses nearby .
wsj_1323	28	People are not apt to be self-conscious about the place or themselves .
wsj_1323	29	Texas is big and beautiful and they live here , that 's all .
wsj_1323	30	Jutting out just to the north of us is the Blackjack Peninsula after the oak , not the game which forms the core of the Aransas Wildlife Refuge .
wsj_1323	31	It is famous as the winter home of the whooping crane , that symbol of the destruction of wild America .
wsj_1323	32	Last year a gunner shot a whooper by mistake thinking that it was a snow goose .
wsj_1323	33	He paid an immense fine and was lucky , according to a local wag , to escape the gas chamber .
wsj_1323	34	The peninsula comes off the vast southeastern alluvial plain with fields of rice and cotton and sorghum as far as the eye can see .
wsj_1323	35	Near the coast there are dense coverts of live oak interspersed with marshes and prairies .
wsj_1323	36	Deer , wild hog , armadillos and alligators are the glamour quadrupeds and the birds are innumerable , especially the herons and the spoonbills .
wsj_1323	37	Above the blossoms of lantana and scarlet pea the inky-brown and golden palamedes butterfly floats on its lazy wingbeat .
wsj_1323	38	Inland a few miles from the refuge there is a place called Tivoli , with a white church , a gas station and a grocery , the houses relatively close together for such a settlement in these parts .
wsj_1323	39	`` Tivoli Motel , '' I read a sign in the usual pronunciation of the name as we whoosh through .
wsj_1323	40	`` Here in south Texas we say Tie-vole-ee , '' my host gently corrects .
wsj_1323	41	Mr. King is the director of the Foreign Press Center in New York .
wsj_1324	0	AEG AG and Siemens AG said they will launch their previously announced joint venture for power semiconductors in January .
wsj_1324	1	The two West German electronics concerns said they have set up European Power Semiconductor Co. to merge their activities in the field .
wsj_1324	2	AEG and Siemens each will hold a 50 % stake in the venture .
wsj_1324	3	The joint venture will have nominal capital of 50 million marks $ 26.9 million and 700 employees .
wsj_1324	4	It will develop , produce and market high-performance electronic parts .
wsj_1324	5	Siemens is West Germany 's largest electronics group .
wsj_1324	6	AEG is 80 % owned by Daimler-Benz AG , the country 's biggest industrial concern .
wsj_1325	0	Dana Corp. said its third-quarter net income fell 27 % to $ 29.6 million , or 72 cents a share , from $ 40.7 million , or $ 1 a share , a year earlier .
wsj_1325	1	Sales dropped 4 % to $ 1.12 billion from $ 1.17 billion .
wsj_1325	2	The company , which supplies transmissions and other drive-train parts to auto makers , said about half the earnings drop came from the `` virtual collapse '' of the Venezuelan auto industry .
wsj_1325	3	The Venezuelan currency plummeted this year , making it difficult for auto makers there to afford imported parts .
wsj_1325	4	Dana also said it was hurt by slumping U.S. truck sales and by a strike at a parts supplier .
wsj_1325	5	The company , based in Toledo , Ohio , had said it expected reduced third-quarter profit .
wsj_1325	6	Mary Anne Sudol , an analyst at Fitch Investors in New York , said automotive suppliers were reporting lower profit almost `` across the board . ''
wsj_1325	7	Southwood J. Morcott , Dana 's president , said the company 's decision to approve its normal fourth-quarter dividend indicated its underlying strength .
wsj_1326	0	Norimasa Furuta , president of Japan 's Mazda Motor Corp. , said the Japanese car maker is planning joint production with Ford Motor Co. in Europe ahead of the European Community 's 1992 integration .
wsj_1326	1	Mr. Furuta did n't disclose further details of the arrangement at a news conference , but said the project would be undertaken with Ford 's European subsidiary .
wsj_1326	2	A Ford official confirmed in Tokyo that the U.S. motor vehicle maker is studying such an arrangement .
wsj_1329	0	Emerson Electric Co. and Robert Bosch G.m.b.H. said the Federal Trade Commission has requested additional information from the two companies about their announced intention to acquire Vermont American Corp. for $ 40 a share , or about $ 440 million .
wsj_1329	1	Yesterday , in composite trading on the American Stock Exchange , Vermont American common closed at $ 39.75 , off 25 cents .
wsj_1329	2	The FTC 's request was `` not unusual '' and Emerson will make a `` full and prompt '' response , according to a spokesman .
wsj_1329	3	Spokesmen for Emerson and Vermont American , which has agreed to be acquired , said they do n't anticipate `` any problems '' with the completion of the transaction .
wsj_1329	4	An FTC spokesman said the matter is `` in a non-public posture at this time '' and declined to comment further .
wsj_1329	5	Emerson and Bosch , through their joint acquisition arm , Maple Acquisition , have begun a cash tender offer for all of Vermont 's common shares outstanding .
wsj_1329	6	The offer , set to expire Nov. 1 , may be extended pending the timing and resolution of the FTC request , the companies said .
wsj_1329	7	St. Louis-based Emerson and Stuttgart-based Bosch make electrical and electronic products , including power tools .
wsj_1329	8	The Vermont American acquisition is designed to enhance their position in the accessories portion of the power-tool industry .
wsj_1330	0	Santa Fe Pacific Corp. is preparing a plan to sell a 20 % stake in its large real estate unit to a California public employee pension fund for $ 400 million , after which it would spin off the realty operation to shareholders .
wsj_1330	1	The plan places an indicated value on the real estate operation , Santa Fe Pacific Realty Corp. , of $ 2 billion .
wsj_1330	2	Santa Fe Pacific directors are expected to review the plan at a meeting today , according to people familiar with the transaction .
wsj_1330	3	If approved , the sale is expected to close by year 's end , with the spinoff occurring by the end of 1992 .
wsj_1330	4	In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday , Santa Fe Pacific closed at $ 20.625 , down 25 cents .
wsj_1330	5	Santa Fe Pacific Realty is a major California land and building owner whose prime properties include 1,850 undeveloped acres in the San Francisco Bay area , and several office sites .
wsj_1330	6	A spokesman said the properties survived without significant damage in last week 's Northern California earthquake .
wsj_1330	7	As a result of the partial sale and spinoff , the $ 56 billion California Public Employees Retirement System would obtain two seats on the board of the real estate operation , according to officials of the fund , who described the plan .
wsj_1330	8	A spokesman for Chicago-based Santa Fe Pacific confirmed that negotiations were being held with the fund .
wsj_1330	9	Also holding two seats each on the board , they said , would be Olympia & York Developments Ltd. , controlled by the Reichmann family of Canada , and Itel Corp. , controlled by Chicago businessman Sam Zell .
wsj_1330	10	The Reichmanns and Mr. Zell , the largest holders of Santa Fe Pacific stock , have been looking for ways to raise the value of their investments , including possible spinoffs .
wsj_1330	11	Itel bought a 17 % stake in Sante Fe Pacific last year and Olympia & York later purchased about a 20 % stake ; they would have interests in the new realty company in line with their holdings in Sante Fe Pacific .
wsj_1330	12	The sale and spinoff of the real estate unit is the first phase of what could lead to the breakup of Santa Fe Pacific into free-standing companies for its railroad and energy operations , as well as real estate .
wsj_1330	13	The debt-laden parent has been under pressure from large shareholders to boost the company 's share price .
wsj_1330	14	At the same time it has been caught in an earnings squeeze .
wsj_1330	15	The California pension fund 's planned investment in the real estate unit is unusual .
wsj_1330	16	Pension funds rarely own as much as a 20 % stake in what is expected to be a publicly traded company .
wsj_1330	17	In addition , pension funds are rarely given seats on company boards and most often try to avoid them because of legal concerns .
wsj_1330	18	But fund officials said the Santa Fe Pacific Realty investment provides an opportunity to buy a stake in a large real estate portfolio heavily weighted with California properties .
wsj_1330	19	It also marks a `` major commitment to real estate development , which we have n't been involved with before , '' said Dale Hanson , the fund 's executive director .
wsj_1330	20	Under the proposed plan , the fund would also lend Santa Fe Pacific Realty $ 75 million in the form of a note that would be convertible into additional shares of the realty company after the second year at the then-prevailing market price .
wsj_1330	21	The note would accrue interest at the rate of 13.5 % a year , which would be payable to the fund after five years , according to Stephen E. Roulac , a real estate consultant working for the fund .
wsj_1330	22	The purpose of the note is to provide added capital for the spun-off company in a form that will save it spending cash on immediate interest payments , Mr. Roulac said .
wsj_1330	23	The spun-off concern `` clearly will be one of the dominant real estate development companies with a prime portfolio , '' he said .
wsj_1330	24	For the last year , Santa Fe Pacific has redirected its real estate operations toward longer-term development of its properties , hurting profits that the parent had generated in the past from periodic sales from its portfolio .
wsj_1330	25	Real estate operating income for the first nine months fell to $ 71.9 million from $ 143 million a year earlier , the company said .
wsj_1330	26	In a statement late yesterday , Santa Fe Pacific 's chairman , Robert D. Krebs , said that Santa Fe Pacific Realty would repay more than $ 500 million in debt owed to the parent before the planned spinoff .
wsj_1330	27	That would help reduce Santa Fe Pacific 's remaining debt to about $ 600 million from a high of $ 3.7 billion in early 1988 .
wsj_1330	28	It was n't clear where Santa Fe Pacific expected to obtain the payment of more than $ 500 million , which would be well above the $ 400 million that California pension fund officials say they plan to provide .
wsj_1330	29	The realty unit might take on new debt or obtain additional investors , among other possibilities .
wsj_1330	30	The Santa Fe Pacific spokesman declined to comment on that aspect , saying the deal was still under negotiation .
wsj_1330	31	Santa Fe Pacific Realty owns 2.8 million acres of property , including 219 buildings with more than 11 million square feet of space .
wsj_1330	32	It also holds nearly 40,000 acres of raw land with development potential , but under a previously announced strategy , the company has targeted building on 5,400 acres in California , Arizona and the Chicago area .
wsj_1330	33	Among those are the 1,850 acres in the San Francisco Bay area , including 208 acres in the Mission Bay area .
wsj_1330	34	The California pension fund , which has $ 16 billion already invested in real estate and mortgages , could be a valuable funding source for that development , although it is n't obliged to make further investments .
wsj_1330	35	The fund is the nation 's largest public employee fund , and it has a growing cash flow now topping $ 3 billion a year .
wsj_1330	36	Fund officials negotiated the final structure of the proposed deal with Santa Fe Pacific , but they were approached with the idea by real estate brokers JMB Realty Corp. of Chicago .
wsj_1330	37	JMB officials are expected to be hired to represent the pension fund on the Santa Fe Pacific Realty board , Mr. Roulac said , to insulate the fund from potential liability problems .
wsj_1333	0	Varian Associates Inc. , Palo Alto , Calif. , reported fiscal fourth-quarter profit plunged more than 95 % to $ 1 million , or five cents a share , from $ 24.2 million , or $ 1.10 a share , in the year-earlier quarter .
wsj_1333	1	The diversified electronics company blamed the decline in the quarter ended Sept. 29 , on previously reported operating problems in its Electron Devices & Systems Group .
wsj_1333	2	For the full fiscal year , Varian posted a 13 % profit rise to $ 31.5 million , or $ 1.53 a share , up from $ 27.8 million , or $ 1.27 a share , last year .
wsj_1333	3	Sales for the year rose almost 15 % to $ 1.34 billion from $ 1.17 billion last year .
wsj_1333	4	A profit last year in both the quarter and year included a net gain of $ 9.6 million , or 44 cents a share , from the sale of a division .
wsj_1333	5	Additionally , the full-year profit last year reflected an after-tax restructuring charge of $ 22.8 million , or $ 1.04 a share .
wsj_1333	6	Shares of Varian , which last month warned there would be a fourth-quarter plunge , closed at $ 22.75 , down 62.5 cents in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange .
wsj_1333	7	Sales rose 18 % in the fiscal fourth quarter to $ 364.1 million from $ 307.9 million on the strength in semiconductors and other products .
wsj_1334	0	In a last-ditch effort to keep its sales force and customer base , Integrated Resources Inc. said it agreed in principle to transfer ownership of its broker-dealer subsidiary to two of its top executives .
wsj_1334	1	The financial-services firm , struggling since summer to avoid a bankruptcy-law filing after missing interest payments on about $ 1 billion of debt , will retain the right to regain the subsidiary .
wsj_1334	2	It said it will exercise that right only if it sells substantially all of its other core businesses .
wsj_1334	3	It also can sell the right to regain the subsidiary to another party .
wsj_1334	4	Also , the broker-dealer subsidiary , Integrated Resources Equity Corp. , was renamed Royal Alliance Associates Inc .
wsj_1334	5	Because of Integrated 's widely reported troubles , the unit 's representatives had been requesting a name change .
wsj_1334	6	Royal Alliance , to which the 3,900 representatives ' licenses will be transferred , is a shell company Integrated owns .
wsj_1334	7	In the transaction , Integrated will transfer 100 % ownership of the subsidiary to Gerard M. Lavin , executive vice president of Integrated and head of back-office operations at the subsidiary , and Gary W. Krat , executive vice president of the parent and president of the subsidiary .
wsj_1334	8	Integrated will pump $ 3.5 million to $ 4 million into Royal Alliance as initial funding .
wsj_1334	9	In an interview , Mr. Krat said that based on criteria yet to be determined , he expects to distribute 49 % of Royal Alliance to the representatives , who sell Integrated 's insurance and mutual-fund products .
wsj_1334	10	If Integrated regains Royal Alliance , the representatives will retain their 49 % ownership .
wsj_1334	11	Mr. Krat indicated that completion of the transaction could take several weeks , and it was n't immediately clear what would happen to the broker-dealer subsidiary if Integrated files for bankruptcy-law protection in the meantime .
wsj_1334	12	The subsidiary is n't expected to be profitable for at least one year .
wsj_1334	13	If Integrated regains the unit , it would receive any profit the unit reports , even while the unit is independent .
wsj_1334	14	If the deal closes , the two officers will draw salaries from the independent operation , not from Integrated .
wsj_1334	15	Many aspects of the agreement were worked out Wednesday in Chicago , when Integrated senior managers met with about 150 representatives .
wsj_1334	16	`` I think it was something that we and they thought was constructive , '' said Stephen D. Weinroth , chairman and co-chief executive officer of Integrated .
wsj_1334	17	Integrated made its announcement after the market closed .
wsj_1334	18	In New York Stock Exchange Composite trading , Integrated shares closed at $ 1.125 , up 12.5 cents .
wsj_1335	0	The dollar weakened in indecisive trading as foreign-exchange dealers awaited fresh economic news that they hope will jolt the U.S. unit out of its narrow ranges .
wsj_1335	1	The Canadian dollar climbed to its highest level against the U.S. dollar since late August , prompting the Bank of Canada to sell the Canadian currency on the market .
wsj_1335	2	Traders say that after a week of nervously tracking every development on Wall Street , the foreign-exchange market has settled back to catch its breath ahead of new U.S. economic data .
wsj_1335	3	They noted , however , that a 26-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average gave the dollar a sharp nudge downward late in the day .
wsj_1335	4	In late New York trading yesterday , the dollar was quoted at 1.8470 marks , down from 1.8578 marks late Friday , and at 141.90 yen , down from 142.43 yen late Friday .
wsj_1335	5	Sterling was quoted at $ 1.6030 , up from $ 1.5885 late Friday .
wsj_1335	6	In Tokyo Tuesday , the U.S. currency opened for trading at 141.80 yen , down from Monday 's Tokyo close of 142.40 yen .
wsj_1335	7	The market 's attention is especially focused on a preliminary report on the U.S. third-quarter gross national product , due out Thursday , which could show the economy is continuing to expand at a relatively brisk pace .
wsj_1335	8	The consensus view on real GNP , the total value of the U.S. output of goods and services adjusted for inflation , calls for a 2.3 % gain on an annual basis , slowing somewhat from the second quarter 's 2.5 % , but still fairly strong .
wsj_1335	9	Few market participants expect the U.S. unit to rally sharply on the news , if it turns out as expected .
wsj_1335	10	Many contend that the report may overstate the economy 's health and predict the third-quarter figures may be the last vigorous statistics for some time to come .
wsj_1335	11	`` Everyone is waiting for GNP , '' says Walter Simon , an assistant treasurer with Bank Julius Baer & Co .
wsj_1335	12	`` Yet even a relatively strong number -- 2.8 % to 2.9 % -- wo n't alter the market 's view that the economy is softening . ''
wsj_1335	13	Hubert Pedroli , managing director of foreign exchange at Credit Suisse in New York , adds , `` The market sees this as the last piece of good news . ''
wsj_1335	14	Mr. Pedroli notes that the GNP deflator , a measure of inflation , is expected to slow , which would give the Federal Reserve more room to ease key U.S. rates .
wsj_1335	15	Analysts predict a 3.5 % rise in the deflator , after climbing 4.6 % in the second quarter .
wsj_1335	16	They note that when an unexpectedly sharp widening in the U.S. trade gap in August was reported earlier this month , hopes for a sustained narrowing of the trade deficit were dashed and sentiment gripped the market that the U.S. economy was losing its momentum .
wsj_1335	17	A 190-point plunge in U.S. stock shares compounded the view , they say .
wsj_1335	18	`` Everyone is extremely convinced the economy is slowing , '' says one senior New York dealer .
wsj_1335	19	`` If we 're not headed for a recession , we 're certainly headed for a major slowdown . ''
wsj_1335	20	While the market expects little reaction from news of U.S. durable goods orders , scheduled for release today , participants note that the figures will probably serve to reinforce this bearish sentiment .
wsj_1335	21	U.S. durable goods orders are expected to show a decline of 1.2 % in September , according to economists .
wsj_1335	22	The anticipated drop follows a 3.9 % rise in August .
wsj_1335	23	Traders , however , are quick to point out that while there is little enthusiasm for buying dollars , the U.S. unit has found a `` natural bottom '' at about 1.85 marks and 140 yen .
wsj_1335	24	Its resilience around these levels is pegged to persistent investor demand for the greenback , especially in Japan .
wsj_1335	25	On the Commodity Exchange in New York , gold for current delivery settled at $ 367 an ounce , down 30 cents .
wsj_1335	26	Estimated volume was a very light one million ounces .
wsj_1335	27	In early trading in Hong Kong Tuesday , gold was quoted at $ 366.79 an ounce .
wsj_1336	0	Liz Claiborne Inc. , New York , said its third-quarter net income jumped 62 % , citing continued strength in apparel sales and the start of shipments of its new product lines : a men 's fragrance , large-size women 's apparel and casual knitwear .
wsj_1336	1	The big apparel maker and retailer said that its net income in the latest quarter increased to $ 51.1 million , or 58 cents a share , from $ 31.7 million , or 36 cents a share , a year earlier .
wsj_1336	2	Sales in the quarter gained 29 % to $ 410.4 million from $ 317.7 million a year earlier .
wsj_1336	3	Claiborne shares closed yesterday at $ 25.125 , up 50 cents , in national over-the-counter trading .
wsj_1336	4	Claiborne 's directors also declared its regular cash dividend payment of five cents a share payable on Dec. 5 to shareholders of record at the close of business on Nov. 13 .
wsj_1336	5	For the nine months , net income rose 48 % to $ 124.2 million , or $ 1.41 a share , from $ 83.8 million , or 96 cents a share a year earlier .
wsj_1336	6	Sales gained 16 % to $ 1.03 billion from $ 894 million .
wsj_1337	0	Tokyo stocks closed firmer Monday , with the Nikkei index making its fifth consecutive daily gain .
wsj_1337	1	Stocks also rose in London , while the Frankfurt market was mixed .
wsj_1337	2	In Tokyo , the Nikkei index added 99.14 to 35585.52 .
wsj_1337	3	The index moved above 35670 at midmorning , nearly reaching the record of 35689.98 set Sept. 28 .
wsj_1337	4	But the market lost part of the early gains on index-linked investment trust fund selling .
wsj_1337	5	In early trading in Tokyo Tuesday , the Nikkei index rose 1.08 points to 35586.60 .
wsj_1337	6	On Monday , traders noted that some investors took profits against the backdrop of the Nikkei 's fast-paced recovery following its plunge last Monday in reaction to the Oct. 13 drop in New York stock prices .
wsj_1337	7	But overall buying interest remained strong through Monday , with many observers saying they expect the Nikkei to continue with moderate gains this week .
wsj_1337	8	Turnover remained relatively small .
wsj_1337	9	Volume on the first section was estimated at 600 million shares , down from 1.03 billion shares Friday .
wsj_1337	10	The Tokyo stock price index of first section issues was up 7.81 at 2687.53 .
wsj_1337	11	Relatively stable foreign currency dealings Monday were viewed favorably by market players , traders said .
wsj_1337	12	But institutional investors may wait a little longer to appraise the direction of the U.S. monetary policy and the dollar , traders said .
wsj_1337	13	Hiroyuki Wada , general manager of the stock department at Okasan Securities , said Monday 's trading was `` unfocused . ''
wsj_1337	14	He said investors were picking individual stocks based on specific incentives and the likelihood of a wider price increase over the short term .
wsj_1337	15	The selective approach blurred themes such as domestic-demand issues , large-capitalization issues or high-technology shares , which had been providing at least some trading direction over the past few weeks , Mr. Wada said .
wsj_1337	16	Investors took profits on major construction shares , which advanced last week , shifting their attention to some midsize companies such as Aoki Corp. , Tobishima and Maeda .
wsj_1337	17	Aoki gained 60 yen to 1,480 yen $ 10.40 .
wsj_1337	18	Some pharmaceutical shares were popular on rumors related to new products to be introduced at a cancer conference that opened in Nagoya .
wsj_1337	19	Teijin was up 15 at 936 , and Kyowa Hakko gained 30 to 1,770 .
wsj_1337	20	Mochida advanced 40 to 4,440 .
wsj_1337	21	Fujisawa continued to attract investors because of strong earning prospects stemming from a new immune control agent .
wsj_1337	22	Fujisawa gained 50 to 2,060 .
wsj_1337	23	Kikkoman was up 30 to 1,600 , receiving investor interest for its land property holdings near Tokyo , a trader said .
wsj_1337	24	London prices closed modestly higher in the year 's thinnest turnover , a condition that underscored a lack of conviction ahead of a U.K. balance of payments report Tuesday .
wsj_1337	25	Limited volume ahead of the September trade data showed the market is nervous , but dealers added that the day 's modest gains also signaled some support for London equities .
wsj_1337	26	They pegged the support largely to anticipation that Britain 's current account imbalance ca n't be much worse than the near record deficits seen in July and August .
wsj_1337	27	`` It 's a case of the market being too high to buy and too afraid to sell , '' a senior dealer with Kleinwort Benson Securities said .
wsj_1337	28	`` It 's better to wait . ''
wsj_1337	29	The Financial Times 100-share index finished 10.6 points higher at 2189.7 .
wsj_1337	30	The 30-share index closed 11.6 points higher at 1772.6 .
wsj_1337	31	Volume was 276.8 million shares , beneath the year 's previous low of 280.5 million shares Sept. 25 , the session before the August trade figures were released .
wsj_1337	32	Analysts ' expectations suggest a September current account deficit of # 1.6 billion $ 2.54 billion , compared with August 's # 2.0 billion deficit .
wsj_1337	33	Dealers , however , said forecasts are broadly divergent with estimates ranging between # 1 billion and # 2 billion .
wsj_1337	34	`` The range of expectations is so broad , '' a dealer at another major U.K. brokerage firm said , `` the deficit may have to be nearer or above # 2 billion for it to have any impact on the market . ''
wsj_1337	35	Lucas Industries , a British automotive and aerospace concern , rose 13 pence to 614 pence after it said its pretax profit for the year rose 28 % .
wsj_1337	36	Share prices on the Frankfurt stock exchange closed narrowly mixed in quiet dealings after recovering most of their early losses .
wsj_1337	37	The DAX index eased 0.99 point to end at 1523.22 after falling 5.5 points early in the session .
wsj_1337	38	Brokers said the declines early in the day were partly caused by losses of the ruling Christian-Democratic Union in communal elections in the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg .
wsj_1337	39	The start of a weeklong conference by the IG Metall metal worker union in Berlin is drawing attention to the impending wage negotiations , which could boost companies ' personnel costs next year , they said .
wsj_1337	40	But there was little selling pressure , and even small orders at the lower levels sufficed to bring the market back to Friday 's opening levels .
wsj_1337	41	Traders said the thin trading volume points to continued uncertainty by most investors following last Monday 's record 13 % loss .
wsj_1337	42	The market is still 4 % short of its level before the plunge , and analysts are n't sure how long it will take until the DAX has closed that gap .
wsj_1337	43	But Norbert Braeuer , chief trader at Hessische Landesbank Girozentrale Helaba , said he expects share prices to move upward in the coming weeks .
wsj_1337	44	Banking stocks were the major gainers Monday amid hope that interest rates have peaked , as Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank added 4 marks each to 664 marks $ 357 and 326 marks , respectively .
wsj_1337	45	Commerzbank gained 1 to 252.5 .
wsj_1337	46	Auto shares were mixed , as Daimler-Benz firmed 2 to 723 , Bayerische Motoren Werke lost the same amount to 554 , and Volkswagen inched down 1.4 to 451.6 .
wsj_1337	47	Elsewhere , prices closed higher in Amsterdam , lower in Zurich , Stockholm and Milan , mixed in Brussels and unchanged in Paris .
wsj_1337	48	Shares closed higher in Hong Kong , Singapore and Manila , and were lower in Sydney , Seoul and Taipei .
wsj_1337	49	Here are price trends on the world 's major stock markets , as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective , Geneva .
wsj_1337	50	To make them directly comparable , each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100 .
wsj_1337	51	The percentage change is since year-end .
wsj_1338	0	Enviropact Inc. said it entered into an agreement in principle to sell its pump and tank division and drilling division to GSX Chemical Services for $ 4 million .
wsj_1338	1	The Miami-based environmental engineering concern said GSX Chemical also will assume about $ 1.6 million in debt related to those divisions .
wsj_1338	2	Further , GSX will buy $ 1 million of Enviropact common stock , at $ 2.625 a share , plus an option to acquire an additional $ 1.5 million of common at the same price , the company said .
wsj_1338	3	In American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , Enviropact closed at $ 3 a share , up 25 cents .
wsj_1338	4	Enviropact said the two divisions account for about $ 8 million of the company 's $ 20 million in annual revenue .
wsj_1338	5	The transaction is expected to close within about 20 days , the company added .
wsj_1338	6	Enviropact said the proceeds will be used as working capital for expansion and to pay its existing tax liability of about $ 1.5 million that was due Sept. 15 .

wsj_1347	0	Exxon Corp. filed suit against the state of Alaska , charging state officials interfered with the oil company 's initial efforts to treat last spring 's giant oil spill .
wsj_1347	1	The action is a counterclaim to a suit filed by Alaska in August against Exxon and six other oil companies .
wsj_1347	2	The state 's suit alleges that Exxon 's response to the spill failed to prevent contamination of hundreds of miles of shoreline along Prince William Sound .
wsj_1347	3	That suit and Exxon 's countersuit were filed in a state court in Anchorage .
wsj_1347	4	Neither suit lists specific dollar claims , largely because damage assessment has n't yet been completed .
wsj_1347	5	Legal strategists say that damage claims against the oil giant and others could well exceed $ 1 billion .
wsj_1347	6	Litigation , if not settled out of court , could drag on for years .
wsj_1347	7	Exxon said in its suit that it will seek reimbursement from the state for that part of the cleanup costs and damage claims it says resulted from the state 's conduct .
wsj_1347	8	The oil company claims that Alaskan officials prevented Exxon from spraying dispersant onto the almost 11 million gallons of oil dumped when one of its tankers ran into an underwater reef .
wsj_1347	9	Craig Tillery , an Alaska assistant attorney general , said in an interview last night that Exxon 's accusations `` are not new .
wsj_1347	10	Exxon has made them before , at which point the state demonstrated they were untrue .
wsj_1347	11	The state will vigorously defend against any counterclaim . ''
wsj_1347	12	Since the spill last March , Exxon and the state have been wrangling over whether spraying dispersant on the oil in the first hours after the spill , when the weather was clear and calm , would have helped limit the environmental damage .
wsj_1347	13	Exxon claims that use of dispersants , which break an oil slick into microscopic droplets , was a crucial part of its immediate-response plan and that state officials banned their use during the two days of fair weather following the spill .
wsj_1347	14	The oil company claims that it had permission from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency prior to the spill to use dispersant during such an incident at the discretion of the U.S. Coast Guard .
wsj_1347	15	The state 's opposition to the use of dispersants , Exxon says , caused the Coast Guard `` to delay granting permission . ''
wsj_1347	16	Alaskan and Coast Guard officials say Exxon 's charges are n't relevant because tests conducted during the first two days following the spill showed that the dispersant was n't working anyway .
wsj_1347	17	Use of dispersants was approved when a test on the third day showed some positive results , officials said .

wsj_1365	0	The Justice Department has revised certain internal guidelines and clarified others in a move that could restrict the use of criminal racketeering charges against white-collar defendants .
wsj_1365	1	The most significant changes in department policy are new requirements that federal prosecutors avoid disrupting `` the normal business functions '' of companies charged under the racketeering law , a senior department official said .
wsj_1365	2	Another important revision of department policy is a new guideline warning prosecutors `` not to take steps that would harm innocent third parties '' in a case brought under the racketeering law , the official , David Runkel , said .
wsj_1365	3	The department distributed the revisions and clarifications to U.S. attorneys around the country this summer as part of a routine process of updating prosecutorial guidelines , Mr. Runkel said .
wsj_1365	4	The changes apply to prosecutions brought under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law .
wsj_1365	5	Under that law , defendants who allegedly commit a pattern of crimes by means of a `` criminal enterprise '' may be charged with racketeering and forced to forfeit the proceeds of the enterprise .
wsj_1365	6	The RICO law has come under criticism from some defendants and defense lawyers .
wsj_1365	7	They argue that the rights of RICO defendants and third parties not named in RICO indictments have been unfairly damaged .
wsj_1365	8	The department 's most significant clarification of existing RICO policy is a directive to prosecutors that they should seek to seize assets from defendants `` in proportion '' to the nature of the alleged offense , Mr. Runkel said .
wsj_1365	9	`` That means that if the offense deals with one part of the business , you do n't attempt to seize the whole business ; you attempt to seize assets related to the crime , '' he explained .
wsj_1365	10	In general , the thrust of the department 's directive is to encourage prosecutors to limit pretrial asset seizures if there are less intrusive means of protecting assets the government may subsequently be able to seize after a conviction , Mr. Runkel said .

wsj_1371	0	Shareholders of Nuovo Banco Ambrosiano S.p.A. voted to accept a bid of 5,500 lire $ 4.03 a share by France 's Credit Agricole for 13.32 % of the bank , rejecting an earlier , equal offer by Italy 's Assicurazioni Generali S.p.A .
wsj_1371	1	The move will give Nuovo Banco a badly needed foreign presence , and make Credit Agricole the bank 's largest shareholder .
wsj_1371	2	It also opens a rift in the bank 's shareholders ' syndicate that could lead to a battle for control of the concern .
wsj_1371	3	Nuovo Banco will become Italy 's biggest private-sector bank when it completes its scheduled merger with Banca Cattolica del Venetoen by year end .
wsj_1371	4	Credit Agricole asked a Milan court to sequester the Nuovo Banco shares , the Italian news agency ANSA reported .
wsj_1371	5	The tribunal is scheduled to rule on the request Friday .
wsj_1371	6	No reason for the request was given .
wsj_1371	7	Credit Agricole officials could n't be immediately reached for comment .
wsj_1371	8	The decision to accept Credit Agricole 's bid , valued at 283.3 billion lire $ 207.4 million , came after a stormy weekend meeting .
wsj_1371	9	Nuovo Banco 's second largest shareholder , the Fiat S.p.A.-controlled investment concern , Gemina S.p.A. , fought to have Generali 's offer approved .
wsj_1371	10	Gemina , which owns 13.26 % of Nuovo Banco , abstained in the final vote on Credit Agricole , which was nonetheless approved by a majority of shareholders .
wsj_1371	11	The linkup with Credit Agricole will give Nuovo Banco its first foreign presence since it was formed from the wreck of the old Banco Ambrosiano , which collapsed amid scandal after the death of Chairman Roberto Calvi in 1982 .
wsj_1371	12	Since then , the bank has strengthened its Italian network , and has posted strong results .
wsj_1371	13	`` The shareholders felt we needed a foreign presence more than we needed links with an insurance company , '' an Ambrosiano spokeswoman said .
wsj_1371	14	Gemina said in a statement that `` it reserves the right to take any action to protect its rights as a member of the syndicate . ''
wsj_1371	15	A company spokeswoman said the company had n't decided what measures to take , but did n't rule out legal action .
wsj_1371	16	Generali , Italy 's biggest insurer , last month offered 5,500 lire a share for the Nuovo Banco stake held by Banco Popolare di Milano , the bank 's largest shareholder , which announced plans to sell the holdings earlier this year .
wsj_1371	17	A Generali spokesman declined to comment on Nuovo Banco 's rejection of the insurer 's offer .
wsj_1371	18	On the Milan stock exchange , Nuovo Banco 's shares jumped to 4,830 lire each from 4,695 lire Friday .
wsj_1372	0	Qintex Australia Ltd. , a media and resorts concern controlled by Australian entrepreneur Christopher Skase , announced a plan to restructure and sell assets to try to ease its financial problems .
wsj_1372	1	Mr. Skase , a 41-year-old former newspaper reporter who chairs the company , said in a statement that Qintex will sell its 51 % stake in its upscale Mirage resorts in Australia and Hawaii as well as three Australian television stations .
wsj_1372	2	The sales are expected to raise more than 600 million Australian dollars US$ 462.2 million , Mr. Skase said .
wsj_1372	3	Qintex Australia has n't disclosed its borrowings , but analysts estimate the company 's debt at A$ 1.2 billion .
wsj_1372	4	Mr. Skase also said the restructuring plan calls for the merger of Qintex Australia with Qintex Ltd. , which owns 55 % of Qintex Australia .
wsj_1372	5	He said the move will `` significantly reduce administrative and operating costs , '' but he did n't provide details of the merger .
wsj_1372	6	Company officials said over the weekend that Qintex Australia 's bank creditors have become concerned about a barrage of bad news at the company , including a failed US$ 1.5 billion plan to buy MGM/UA Communications Co. , a Beverly Hills , Calif. , movie and television production concern .
wsj_1372	7	Friday , Qintex Entertainment Inc. , a 43%-owned U.S. affiliate , filed for protection from creditor lawsuits under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code .
wsj_1372	8	Analysts predicted that the move would further shake creditor confidence in Qintex Australia and force it to sell assets .
wsj_1372	9	The company 's latest moves were disclosed after the Australian Stock Exchange suspended trading in shares of Qintex Australia and Qintex Ltd. because the companies had n't answered an exchange inquiry about the extent of their loans , investments and deposits at Qintex Entertainment .
wsj_1372	10	Mr. Skase 's statement was addressed to the stock exchange and appeared to be a response to the inquiry .
wsj_1372	11	It said Qintex Entertainment owes Qintex Australia US$ 38.1 million in loans not secured by specific assets .
wsj_1372	12	Qintex Australia also said it has an investment of A$ 83.3 million in Qintex Entertainment shares .
wsj_1372	13	In the statement , Mr. Skase said that on the basis of current interest rates in Australia , the company 's asset sales would reduce interest expense by about A$ 120 million a year in addition to eliminating certain liabilities .
wsj_1372	14	In March , Qintex sold 49 % of the three Mirage resorts to Japan 's Nippon Shinpan Co. and Mitsui & Co. for A$ 433 million .
wsj_1372	15	Yesterday 's statement did n't say whether the Japanese companies will acquire Qintex 's remaining stake in the resorts .
wsj_1372	16	Before its shares were suspended from trading , Qintex Australia plunged to 16 Australian cents 12 U.S. cents a share yesterday from 33 Australian cents Friday .
wsj_1372	17	The shares traded at about A$ 1.50 in March , when the plan to acquire MGM/UA was announced .
wsj_1372	18	Qintex Ltd. shares sank to A$ 1.50 yesterday from A$ 3.05 Friday .
wsj_1372	19	Mr. Skase 's statement cited four recent problems that he said had cut group cash flow by more than A$ 200 million .
wsj_1372	20	They were what he called an `` unlawful termination '' by MGM/UA of the acquisition agreement with Qintex , high Australian interest rates , a pilots ' strike at Australian domestic airlines that cut revenue at the company 's Australian resorts and delays in completing a sale of two regional TV stations in Queensland state .
wsj_1372	21	MGM/UA has sued Qintex Australia for breach of contract and fraud over the collapsed acquisition agreement , and Qintex Australia has threatened a countersuit .
wsj_1372	22	Qintex Australia has n't yet reported results for the fiscal year ended July 31 .
wsj_1372	23	In his statement , Mr. Skase said preliminary accounts showed that group profit before interest , tax and depreciation `` will exceed A$ 170 million . ''
wsj_1372	24	He gave no further details .
wsj_1372	25	Shareholders ' funds as of July 31 were estimated at more than A$ 1 billion , Mr. Skase said , compared with A$ 725 million a year earlier .
wsj_1372	26	The company will make `` adequate provisions '' to cover costs of the dispute with MGM/UA and any loss from the investment in Qintex Entertainment , he said .
wsj_1372	27	Mr. Skase also disclosed a disagreement among directors of Qintex Australia over certain fees claimed by Qintex Group Management Services Pty. , a management-services concern in which Qintex Australia executives have an interest .
wsj_1372	28	Qintex Australia paid the management company A$ 32.6 million in the latest fiscal year .
wsj_1372	29	Mr. Skase said most of the money went to other parties for expenses such as rent and travel , but a smaller portion is owed to senior executives and others for management services .
wsj_1372	30	Non-executive directors of Qintex Australia , who must approve payments to the senior executives , balked at the amount .
wsj_1372	31	Two of the directors resigned , Mr. Skase said , so the payments have n't yet been approved .
wsj_1374	0	Tandy Corp. , citing sluggish sales of consumer-electronics goods , said net income dropped 3.3 % for the first quarter ended Sept. 30 .
wsj_1374	1	The results , which represented the fifth consecutive quarter of flat-to-lower earnings for the big electronics retailer , disappointed analysts and traders .
wsj_1374	2	Tandy 's stock fell $ 1.375 a share to close at $ 44 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading .
wsj_1374	3	Net for the quarter was $ 62.8 million , or 73 cents a share , down from $ 64.9 million , or 72 cents a share , a year earlier .
wsj_1374	4	The company said earnings would have increased if it had n't been actively repurchasing its shares , thus increasing its interest expense and reducing its interest income .
wsj_1374	5	Tandy had 86.3 million shares outstanding at Sept. 30 , down from 90 million a year earlier .
wsj_1374	6	Revenue rose 5 % to $ 986 million from $ 937 million .
wsj_1374	7	Tandy said consumer electronics sales at its Radio Shack stores have been slow , partly because of a lack of hot , new products .
wsj_1374	8	`` Radio Shack continues to be lackluster , '' said Dennis Telzrow , analyst with Eppler , Guerin & Turner in Dallas .
wsj_1374	9	He said Tandy `` has done a decent job '' increasing sales by manufacturing computers for others and expanding sales of its Grid Systems Corp. subsidiary , which sells computers to bigger businesses , but `` it 's not enough to offset the problems at Radio Shack . ''
wsj_1374	10	Sales at Radio Shack stores open more than a year grew only 2 % in the quarter from a year earlier , he said .
wsj_1374	11	As a result , Mr. Telzrow said he cut his fiscal 1990 per-share earnings estimate for Tandy to $ 4.05 from $ 4.20 .
wsj_1374	12	Tandy earned $ 88.8 million , or $ 3.64 a share , in the year ended June 30 .
wsj_1374	13	Barry Bryant , an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. , said Tandy also has suffered from lethargic sales of its computers aimed at the home and small-office market , which are less-advanced and cheaper than computers aimed at the corporate market .
wsj_1374	14	Tandy has added several new products to that line , including a laptop computer priced around $ 1,000 , and is focusing its advertising on the easy-to-use software that is packaged with its machines .
wsj_1374	15	Mr. Bryant and other analysts hope all those moves will combine to help Tandy 's results improve in the important Christmas quarter .
wsj_1374	16	`` They 've been promising 13 % to 15 % growth based on the strategic moves they 've made , '' he said .
wsj_1374	17	`` If the earnings acceleration is to take place , that should be the quarter .
wsj_1378	0	American Telephone & Telegraph Co. said it will lay off 75 to 85 technicians here , effective Nov. 1 .

wsj_1379	0	It 's a California crime saga worthy of an Erle Stanley Gardner title : The Case of the Purloined Palm Trees .
wsj_1379	1	Edward Carlson awoke one morning last month to find eight holes in his front yard where his prized miniature palms , called cycads , once stood .
wsj_1379	2	Days later , the thieves returned and dug out more , this time adding insult to injury .
wsj_1379	3	`` The second time , '' he says , `` they left the shovel . ''
wsj_1379	4	No garden-variety crime , palm-tree rustling is sprouting up all over Southern California , bringing big bucks to crooks who know their botany .
wsj_1379	5	Cycads , the most popular of which is the Sago Palm , are doll-sized versions of California 's famous long-necked palms , with stubby trunks and fern-like fronds .
wsj_1379	6	Because the Sago is relatively rare and grows only a couple of inches a year , it 's a pricey lawn decoration : A two-foot tall Sago can retail for $ 1,000 , and taller ones often fetch $ 3,000 or more .
wsj_1379	7	`` Evidently , somebody has realized it 's easy money to steal these things , '' says Loran Whitelock , a research associate specializing in cycads at the Los Angeles State and County Arboretum .
wsj_1379	8	Just last week , would-be thieves damaged three Sagos at Mr. Whitelock 's home in the Eagle Rock section before something frightened them off , foiled .
wsj_1379	9	`` It 's hard to think someone is raping your garden , '' he says .
wsj_1379	10	Police suspect that the criminals , who dig up the plants in the dead of night , are selling them to nurseries or landscapers .
wsj_1379	11	The Sago has become a popular accent in tony new housing tracts , apparently giving the rustlers a ready market for their filched fronds .
wsj_1379	12	Thieves are going to find `` anybody who has enough bucks to plant these things in their front yard , '' says William Morrissey , an investigator with the police department in Garden Grove , Calif. , where five such thefts have been reported in the past several weeks .
wsj_1379	13	The department is advising residents to plant Sagos , if they must , in the back yard and telling nurseries to be on the lookout for anyone trying to palm one off .
wsj_1379	14	But for those Californians who want exotic gardens out front where neighbors can appreciate them , there 's always Harold Smith 's approach .
wsj_1379	15	After three Sagos were stolen from his home in Garden Grove , `` I put a big iron stake in the ground and tied the tree to the stake with a chain , '' he says proudly .
wsj_1379	16	`` And you ca n't cut this chain with bolt cutters .
wsj_1380	0	Program trading on the New York Stock Exchange in September rose to its highest recorded level as a percentage of total monthly trading volume .
wsj_1380	1	September program trading amounted to 13.8 % of average daily New York Stock Exchange volume of 151.8 million shares , the largest percentage since the exchange began making such figures public in July 1988 .
wsj_1380	2	A daily average of 20.9 million shares traded in program strategies in September , the second-highest level ever .
wsj_1380	3	The highest level was in June 1989 , when a daily average of 22.1 million shares traded in program strategies .
wsj_1380	4	Average daily trading volume in June of 180.3 million shares was considerably higher than in September .
wsj_1380	5	Program trading amounted to 12.3 % of average daily volume in June .
wsj_1380	6	The Big Board says program trading describes a variety of strategies involving the purchase or sale of a basket of 15 or more stocks .
wsj_1380	7	The most controversial of these is stock-index arbitrage , in which traders buy or sell baskets of stocks and offset the position with an opposite trade in stock-index futures to lock in profits .
wsj_1380	8	It 's the most controversial form of program trading because it can create abrupt price swings in the stock market .
wsj_1380	9	Salomon Brothers Inc. was the top program trader in September , but most of the firm 's activity involved portfolio trading strategies other than stock-index arbitrage .
wsj_1380	10	Overall , Salomon reported program trading volume of 75.2 million shares .
wsj_1380	11	The top stock-index arbitrage firm last month was Morgan Stanley & Co .
wsj_1380	12	Of Morgan Stanley 's 66.8 million shares in program trades for the month , 53.1 million were in stock-index arbitrage trades .
wsj_1380	13	Behind second-place Morgan Stanley were Kidder , Peabody & Co. , Goldman , Sachs & Co. and CS First Boston Inc. 's First Boston Corp. unit .
wsj_1381	0	A group of shareholders filed suit against Imperial Corp. of America , Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. , First Executive Corp. and others , charging them with artificially inflating Imperial 's stock price to protect certain major investors .
wsj_1381	1	The complaint , filed in federal district court , accuses Imperial and other defendants of issuing false and misleading financial data .
wsj_1381	2	It also charges that Imperial , the holding company for Imperial Savings & Loan , experienced major losses and writedowns because of improper assessment of the risks of junk-bond investments and wholesale consumer loan packages .
wsj_1381	3	The suit seeks unspecified damages .
wsj_1381	4	Imperial is in the midst of reducing its junk-bond holdings and getting out of the investment banking business in order to return to traditional thrift activities .
wsj_1381	5	The derivative suit is similar to a class-action complaint filed earlier this year .
wsj_1381	6	Imperial said in a statement it expects other complaints to be filed in the wake of the original suit and a recent article in Barron 's magazine that focused on the company 's problems .
wsj_1381	7	Although an Imperial spokesman said the company had n't yet been served with the derivative suit , he reiterated the company 's statement that it would vigorously defend itself against the class-action suit .
wsj_1381	8	Spokesmen at Drexel and First Executive said the companies had n't yet been served with the suit .
wsj_1381	9	In a separate complaint also filed in federal court here , shareholder Max Grill of New York charged Imperial , its top executives and directors with breach of fiduciary duty and squandering the company 's assets .
wsj_1381	10	Imperial said it had n't been served with this suit either .
wsj_1382	0	Companies listed below reported quarterly profit substantially different from the average of analysts ' estimates .

wsj_1385	1	The group said it sold 455,410 Southmark common shares from Sept. 5 to Oct. 5 for 18.75 cents to 25 cents a share .
wsj_1385	2	The filing said the group continues to hold 3,481,887 remaining shares .
wsj_1386	0	Eastman Kodak Co. , seeking to position itself in the potentially huge high-definition television market , unveiled a converter that can transform conventional motion-picture film into high-definition video .
wsj_1386	1	The move also helps the Rochester , N.Y. , photographic giant ensure that its motion-picture film business -- for which it holds a virtual monopoly , supplying every Hollywood movie company -- is n't made obsolete by the upstart HDTV business .
wsj_1386	2	While the prototype converter is costly , it 's being lauded by the infant HDTV industry as a way of increasing the number of high-quality shows that can be seen on the new medium .
wsj_1386	3	`` The industry has been waiting with bated breath for the machines to come along , '' says David Niles , president of Eleven Twenty Five Productions Inc. , a New York pioneer in high-definition programming .
wsj_1386	4	He notes that industry executives have until now worried that they would face a severe shortage of programs once consumers begin replacing their TV sets with HDTVs .
wsj_1386	5	Japanese electronic giants , such as Sony Corp. and Hitachi Ltd. , have focused almost entirely on HDTV hardware , and virtually ignored software or programs shot in high-definition .
wsj_1386	6	And only a handful of small U.S. companies are engaged in high-definition software development .
wsj_1386	7	It 's estimated that just about 250 hours of HD programming is currently available for airing .
wsj_1386	8	Kodak says its new CCD HDTV converter will help alleviate the problem by allowing programmers and broadcasters to convert movies and television programs shot in 35mm motion-picture film into high-definition video .
wsj_1386	9	Consumers will be able to switch on their HDTV sets and get all the viewing benefits the high-tech medium offers .
wsj_1386	10	Otherwise , they 'd be watching programs that are no different in quality from what they currently view on color TVs .
wsj_1386	11	It would be like `` watching a black and white movie on a color TV set , '' says Malcolm G. Saull , chairman of the film and video department at the Rochester Institute of Technology .
wsj_1386	12	The new converters are `` a critical link between film and the television domain , '' says Joerg D. Agin , vice president and general manager of Kodak 's Motion Picture and Audiovisual Products division .
wsj_1386	13	Kodak wo n't disclose the cost or when its converter will be on the market , but it 's estimated the machine may be available within two years .
wsj_1386	14	A similar machine already on the market , made by Rank Sintel Ltd. , a unit of Rank Organisation , costs about $ 500,000 .
wsj_1386	15	And the potential market is tremendous , industry experts say .
wsj_1386	16	If HDTV takes off in the U.S. , there will be demand for some 4,000 to 5,000 HDTV converters , known in the industry as telecines .
wsj_1386	17	Demand will come first from programming production companies and then from television stations .
wsj_1386	18	`` The converter is head and shoulders above anything else I 've seen , '' says Richard J. Stumpf , vice president - engineering and development at MCA Inc. 's Universal City Studios .
wsj_1386	19	And Mr. Niles , the program producer , contends that Kodak 's move is `` a sound marketing decision .
wsj_1386	20	They ca n't afford to stay out of HDTV . ''
wsj_1386	21	Indeed , the stakes are high .
wsj_1386	22	The U.S. electronics industry estimates that the HDTV market will total about $ 150 billion over the next two decades , with an additional $ 400 billion expected to go for related products .
wsj_1386	23	HDTVs break down images into more than 1,100 lines , compared with 525 for today 's televisions , providing considerably sharper detail .
wsj_1386	24	And the sets are wider , resembling the dimensions of a movie screen .
wsj_1386	25	But the financial rewards are n't expected soon , nor are they guaranteed .
wsj_1386	26	Experts estimate the first sets of HDTVs wo n't be available for another five to 10 years , and will probably retail for more than $ 3,000 each in today 's dollars .
wsj_1386	27	Some critics say they wo n't be quickly embraced by consumers because of the high price .
wsj_1386	28	Nevertheless , Kodak could n't risk letting HDTV turn its motion-picture film business into a dinosaur .

wsj_1387	0	Yet another political scandal is racking Japan .
wsj_1387	1	But this time it 's hurting opposition as well as ruling-party members .
wsj_1387	2	And as it unfolds , it 's revealing some of the more tangled and seamier aspects of Japanese society .
wsj_1387	3	Already , ruling Liberal Democratic Party demands that opposition members testify under oath in parliament have stalled one budget committee session and forced the committee to plan a special two-day investigation at the end of the month .
wsj_1387	4	But the scandal itself is so convoluted that ruling-party members are divided between those who want to pursue the matter in hope of undermining the opposition and those who favor leaving well enough alone .
wsj_1387	5	`` The opposition can be the most hurt because everyone already figures the LDP is that kind of beast , '' says Shigezo Hayasaka , former aide to LDP kingmaker Kakuei Tanaka and now an independent analyst .
wsj_1387	6	But , he adds , `` We ca n't tell where it will go at all because we 're still in the middle of it . ''
wsj_1387	7	This time , the scandal centers on donations made by the not-quite-mainstream pachinko parlor industry .
wsj_1387	8	Pachinko , a kind of pinball , is Japan 's favorite form of legal gambling .
wsj_1387	9	The donations so far appear to be small , especially compared with the huge sums that changed hands in the Recruit Co . influence-peddling scandal that plagued the ruling party last year .
wsj_1387	10	But the implications could be great .
wsj_1387	11	Pachinko is slightly on the shady side , often linked to the lower ranks of Japan 's underworld and regularly at the top of annual lists of tax evaders .
wsj_1387	12	Recently the industry has faced the threat of new restrictions , and political donations may have been made with the intent to bribe .
wsj_1387	13	Also , about 60 % of pachinko parlor owners are Korean , many of whom maintain close ties with North or South Korean residents ' organizations , and donations by such foreign groups are illegal in Japan .
wsj_1387	14	To many Japanese , pachinko is benign or enticingly unsavory .
wsj_1387	15	Garish neon pachinko marquees blaze from the main streets and narrow alleys of cities and towns across the country .
wsj_1387	16	Devotees pass hours , watching the lights blink and listening to the metal balls ping , as much to gamble as to get a little time to be anonymous , alone with their thoughts .
wsj_1387	17	At 500 yen $ 3.60 for a handful of balls , pachinko is a common pastime , and has been since it took root as cheap entertainment in the years after World War II .
wsj_1387	18	But the total of all those pinging balls has created an industry with a reported annual income of 13 trillion yen almost $ 92 billion , or nearly the size of Japan 's vaunted automobile industry .
wsj_1387	19	And because the pachinko industry is regularly at the top of annual lists for tax evasion , some observers estimate the real income could be as much as 20 trillion yen .
wsj_1387	20	If that money were being taxed , it could bring the government a badly needed several trillion yen .
wsj_1387	21	In 1984 , an attempt was made to crack down on the industry with tougher restrictions .
wsj_1387	22	Then , in 1988 , a proposal to keep better track of income by selling prepaid cards for pachinko was fielded in parliament .
wsj_1387	23	The proposal split the industry in two , along the lines of national origin : North Koreans oppose the plan while South Koreans , Japanese and Taiwanese accept it or are neutral .
wsj_1387	24	In August , a conservative weekly magazine reported that a pachinko industry organization donated money to Japan Socialist Party members .
wsj_1387	25	The magazine alleged that in making the donations , the pachinko industry may have been offering bribes to win support in the battle against prepaid cards , or it may have been laundering money back and forth between the JSP and the North Korean residents ' organization , the Chosen Soren .
wsj_1387	26	The Chosen Soren and the JSP immediately denied the report .
wsj_1387	27	And at first , neither the opposition nor the LDP wanted to pursue the issue .
wsj_1387	28	But the press kept it alive ; as with the Recruit scandal , lists began circulating with names of people who had received money .
wsj_1387	29	Within a matter of weeks , less-conservative magazines reported that members of the ruling LDP had received much larger donations from pachinko organizations .
wsj_1387	30	So far , though , there have been no allegations that the contributions the LDP members received amounted to bribes .
wsj_1387	31	Then the two camps upped the ante : Reports that Chosen Soren had donated directly to JSP members were rapidly countered by statements that the South Korean residents ' organization had long been donating directly to LDP members .
wsj_1387	32	The JSP admitted Oct. 13 that its members received about eight million yen from the pachinko organization , and charged LDP members with receiving 125 million yen $ 880,000 and other opposition parties with taking about 2.5 million yen .
wsj_1387	33	On Friday , the chief cabinet secretary announced that eight cabinet ministers had received five million yen from the industry , including 450,000 yen $ 3,175 by Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu .
wsj_1387	34	No one has alleged that the donations were by themselves illegal .
wsj_1387	35	Direct donations from either of the residents ' organizations would be illegal because the groups are defined as foreign , but both groups deny making direct donations .
wsj_1387	36	They say it s possible some of their members may be donating privately .
wsj_1387	37	The issue is further complicated because although the organizations represent Korean residents , those residents were largely born and raised in Japan and many speak only Japanese .
wsj_1387	38	That they retain Korean citizenship and ties is a reflection of history -- their parents were shipped in as laborers during the decades when Japan occupied Korea before World War II -- and the discrimination that still faces Koreans in Japanese society .
wsj_1387	39	Many Japanese think it only natural that the organizations or their members would donate to politicians , the way many Japanese do , to win favor or support .
wsj_1387	40	Both residents ' organizations admit to receiving some funding from abroad .
wsj_1387	41	But LDP members and supporters of the prepaid card idea tend to speak in innuendo about the JSP 's alleged donations , implying that North Korean money would be more suspect than South Korean because North Korea is communist and South Korea is an ally .

wsj_1396	0	The Senate convicted U.S. District Judge Alcee Hastings of Florida of eight impeachment articles , removing the 53-year-old judge from his $ 89,500-a-year , lifetime job .
wsj_1396	1	Mr. Hastings 's case was particularly nettlesome because it marked the first time a federal official was impeached and removed from office on charges of which a jury had acquitted him .
wsj_1396	2	In 1983 , Mr. Hastings was found not guilty of accepting a $ 150,000 bribe in a case before him , the central charge on which the Senate convicted him .
wsj_1396	3	He was only the sixth federal judge ever ousted from office after an impeachment trial .
wsj_1396	4	With no floor debate , the Senate on Friday voted 69-26 to convict Mr. Hastings of perjury and conspiring to accept a bribe , five votes more than needed .
wsj_1396	5	Conviction on any single impeachment article was enough to remove Judge Hastings from office .
wsj_1396	6	He was found not guilty of three charges , involving accusations that he had improperly disclosed information about a sensitive , government investigation .
wsj_1396	7	The Senate did n't vote on six lesser charges .
wsj_1396	8	Although Mr. Hastings had been acquitted by a jury , lawmakers handling the prosecution in Congress had argued that the purpose of impeachment is n't to punish an individual .
wsj_1396	9	Instead , they argued that impeachment aims to protect public institutions from people who have abused their positions of trust , irrespective of the outcome of prior criminal or civil cases .
wsj_1396	10	Mr. Hastings faced the senators and sat impassively during the first two roll-call votes , then quickly left the chamber .
wsj_1396	11	In an impromptu news conference on the Capitol steps , he denounced the senators ' action .
wsj_1396	12	`` Their opinion is devoid of the wisdom of the forefathers ' teaching regarding impeachment , '' Mr. Hastings said .
wsj_1396	13	For the future , he said he would run for governor of Florida .

wsj_1405	0	With the dust settling from the failed coup attempt in Panama , one of the many lingering questions the Bush administration will ponder is this : Is the National Security Council staff big enough , and does it have enough clout , to do its job of coordinating foreign policy ?
wsj_1405	1	President Bush 's national security adviser , Lt. Gen. Brent Scowcroft , came into office in January intent on making the NSC staff leaner and more disciplined than it had been during the Reagan administration .
wsj_1405	2	Gen. Scowcroft was a member of the Tower Commission , which investigated the Iran-Contra affair .
wsj_1405	3	He was all too aware of how a large , inadequately supervised NSC staff had spun out of control and nearly wrecked President Reagan 's second term .
wsj_1405	4	So , following both the style he pursued as President Ford 's national security adviser and the recommendations of the Tower Commission , Gen. Scowcroft has pruned the NSC staff and tried to ensure that it sticks to its assigned tasks -- namely , gathering the views of the State Department , Pentagon and intelligence community ; serving as an honest broker in distilling that information for the president and then making sure presidential decisions are carried out .
wsj_1405	5	The Tower Commission specifically said that the NSC staff should be `` small '' and warned against letting `` energetic self-starters '' like Lt. Col. Oliver North strike out on their own rather than leaving the day-to-day execution of policies to the State Department , Pentagon or Central Intelligence Agency .
wsj_1405	6	However , the Panama episode has raised questions about whether the NSC staff is sufficiently big , diverse and powerful to coordinate U.S. policy on tough issues .
wsj_1405	7	During the coup attempt and its aftermath , NSC staffers were `` stretched very thin , '' says one senior administration official .
wsj_1405	8	`` It 's a very small shop . ''
wsj_1405	9	Gen. Scowcroft does n't plan to increase the staff right now , but is weighing that possibility , the official adds .
wsj_1405	10	The NSC staff `` does n't have the horsepower that I believe is required to have an effective interagency process , '' says Frank Gaffney , a former Pentagon aide who now runs the Center for Security Policy , a conservative Washington think-tank .
wsj_1405	11	`` The problem with this administration , I think , is that by design it has greatly diminished , both in a physical sense and in a procedural sense , the role of the NSC . ''
wsj_1405	12	The National Security Council itself was established in 1947 because policy makers sensed a need , in an increasingly complex world , for a formal system within the White House to make sure that communications flowed smoothly between the president and the State Department , Pentagon and intelligence agencies .
wsj_1405	13	By law , the council includes the president , vice president and secretaries of state and defense .
wsj_1405	14	In practice , the director of central intelligence and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff also serve as unofficial members .
wsj_1405	15	But the size , shape and role of the NSC staff have been left for each president and his national security adviser to decide .
wsj_1405	16	That task is one of Washington 's perennial problems .
wsj_1405	17	In the Bush White House , the size of the NSC 's staff of professional officers is down to about 50 from about 70 in 1987 , administration officials say .
wsj_1405	18	Administration officials insist that the size of the staff was n't a problem during the Panama crisis .
wsj_1405	19	But one clear problem during the coup attempt was that the NSC staffer most experienced in Latin America , Everett Briggs , was gone .
wsj_1405	20	He had just resigned , at least in part because of a feud with Assistant Secretary of State Bernard Aronson over the administration 's policy on Panama and support for Nicaragua 's Contra rebels .
wsj_1405	21	The absence of Mr. Briggs underscored the possible inadequacy of the current NSC staff .
wsj_1405	22	Both Gen. Scowcroft and his deputy , Robert Gates , are experts in U.S.-Soviet affairs .
wsj_1405	23	Gen. Scowcroft is particularly well-versed in arms control , and Mr. Gates has spent years studying Soviet politics and society .
wsj_1405	24	Both have become confidants of President Bush .
wsj_1405	25	But neither has an extensive background in Latin America , the Middle East or Asia .
wsj_1405	26	In those areas , the role of NSC staffers under them therefore have become more important .
wsj_1405	27	Gen. Scowcroft knows as well as anyone that one of the biggest dangers he faces is that NSC staffers working in relative anonymity will take over policy-making and operational tasks that are best left to bigger and more experienced State Department and Pentagon bureaus .
wsj_1405	28	But just as every previous NSC adviser has , Gen. Scowcroft now will have to mull at what point the NSC staff becomes too lean and too restrained .

wsj_1407	0	A former Sperry Corp. marketing executive , admitting his role in the Pentagon procurement scandal , pleaded guilty to bribery and conspiracy charges for helping funnel $ 400,000 to a midlevel Navy acquisition official during the early 1980s .
wsj_1407	1	Frank Lavelle , who at the time was the marketing director for Sperry in Clearwater , Fla. , admitted participating in a scheme to bribe Garland Tomlin , the Navy official .
wsj_1407	2	Mr. Tomlin , who left the Navy in 1985 , pleaded guilty earlier this year to related conspiracy , bribery and tax-evasion charges .
wsj_1407	3	The bribery scheme took place between 1982 and 1985 , according to documents filed by prosecutors in connection with Mr. Lavelle 's guilty plea in federal district court in Alexandria , Va .
wsj_1407	4	Sperry merged with Burroughs Corp. to become Unisys Corp. in late 1986 .
wsj_1407	5	Court documents filed by prosecutors indicate Mr. Tomlin tried to steer to Sperry a multimillion dollar contract to computerize maintenance of certain Navy electronics equiment .
wsj_1407	6	Mr. Tomlin , among other things , illegally provided Mr. Lavelle with inside information and documents intended to give Sperry an unfair advantage in the competition , the documents said .
wsj_1407	7	Sperry ultimately was eliminated from the competition without receiving the work .
wsj_1407	8	Documents filed by prosecutors also indicate that Mr. Lavelle and his fellow conspirators requested and obtained `` approval of the scheme '' from more-senior Sperry officials `` because the payment which Mr . Tomlin requested was so large . ''
wsj_1407	9	Charles Gardner , a former Unisys vice president , and James Neal , a former company consultant , have admitted participating in this and other bribery schemes .
wsj_1407	10	Unisys has said that all of the company officials who participated in improper activities have left the company .

wsj_1410	0	Ford Motor Co. and Saab-Scania AB of Sweden broke off talks about a possible alliance after Ford officials concluded that the cost to modernize Saab 's car operations would outweigh the likely return .
wsj_1410	1	With the collapse of the talks Friday , European analysts expect Ford to intensify its pursuit of British luxury car maker Jaguar PLC , which is scrambling to fend off a hostile Ford bid by negotiating a friendly alliance with Ford 's archrival , General Motors Corp .
wsj_1410	2	Saab , meanwhile , is left to continue its search for an ally to shore up its sagging car business .
wsj_1410	3	Saab said last week it `` has had and will continue to have contacts with other manufacturers . ''
wsj_1410	4	Among the possible suitors is Italy 's Fiat S.p . A , analysts said last week .
wsj_1410	5	Ford and Saab officials declined to elaborate publicly on the announcement Friday that their negotiations failed to yield an agreement `` that could make long-term business sense to both parties . ''
wsj_1410	6	Individuals close to the Ford side of the negotiations said late last week that the No. 2 U.S. auto maker lost interest as it became clear that the Swedish auto maker 's automotive operations had little to offer in the way of image or technology .
wsj_1410	7	Ford originally had seen a Saab alliance as a way to expand its presence in the European and U.S. luxury car markets .
wsj_1410	8	In addition , Ford and Saab had discussed a possible link between their heavy truck operations .
wsj_1410	9	But the talks on a heavy truck alliance apparently did n't go far .
wsj_1410	10	Some European analysts speculated that officials of Saab 's highly profitable Scania truck operation balked at surrendering any of their autonomy .
wsj_1410	11	Meanwhile , Ford officials became convinced they could n't expect to recover the investment it would require to make Saab 's cars competitive in the increasingly crowded luxury market .
wsj_1410	12	Saab 's problems were underscored Friday when the company announced that its car division had a 1.2 billion kronor $ 186.1 million loss during the first eight months of this year , slightly worse than Saab-Scania had forecast in its first-half report last month .
wsj_1410	13	Overall , Saab-Scania 's pretax profit during the first eight months of the year plunged 48.9 % to 1 billion Swedish kronor $ 155.1 million from 1.96 billion kronor $ 303.9 million a year earlier .
wsj_1410	14	Industry analysts in Europe said the most likely suitor for Saab now is Fiat .
wsj_1410	15	Saab and Fiat have worked together in the past , in one case developing jointly a new auto chassis that became the foundation of Saab 's 9000 model , Fiat 's Croma and Lancia 's Thema .
wsj_1410	16	Last month , Saab-Scania Chief Executive Georg Karnsund said his company has had talks with Fiat about a broader alliance .
wsj_1410	17	But the talks yielded `` nothing so advanced that we needed to make a public announcement about it , '' he said .
wsj_1410	18	As for Ford , analysts expect the end of the Saab play will allow the U.S. auto maker to focus its resources on the intensifying struggle with GM for a stake in Jaguar .
wsj_1410	19	The failure of the Saab talks `` makes it even more crucial for Ford to be victorious '' in the Jaguar contest , said Stephen Reitman , European auto industry analyst at UBS-Phillips & Drew in London .
wsj_1410	20	Ford faces an uphill fight for Jaguar , however .
wsj_1410	21	Jaguar executives said last week they expect to have a friendly alliance with GM wrapped up by the end of the month .
wsj_1410	22	GM , meanwhile , is hosting a delegation of members of the British Parliament who are touring the auto maker 's headquarter operations in Detroit .
wsj_1410	23	A GM spokesman said the visit is n't connected to the Jaguar situation .
wsj_1410	24	But Ford clearly views Jaguar as a prize worth fighting for , since the company 's gilded brand image would give Ford a badly needed leg up in the high end of the luxury markets in both Europe and the U.S. .
wsj_1410	25	Last week , Ford encountered a setback in its effort to broaden its U.S. luxury offerings when it was forced to abandon a four-year-old effort to market its German-built Scorpio sedan in the U.S. as a luxury import under the Merkur brand name .
wsj_1410	26	So despite the GM-Jaguar romance , analysts say Ford by last Friday had boosted its Jaguar holding to about 11 % of the luxury auto maker 's shares outstanding from 10.4 % early last week .
wsj_1410	27	About 5.4 million Jaguar shares changed hands in active trading on London 's stock exchange Friday , and Jaguar shares moved up 19 pence to 696 pence $ 11 .
wsj_1410	28	On the U.S. over-the-counter market , Jaguar 's American depositary receipts rose 12.5 cents to $ 11.125 .

wsj_1412	7	Of course the Palestinians complain about their treatment ; of course the Israelis feel put upon .

wsj_1413	0	President Bush wants the Pentagon to get special treatment in coping with the across-the-board spending cuts that took effect last week .
wsj_1413	1	Mr. Bush asked Congress to raise to $ 6 billion from $ 3 billion the amount of money Defense Secretary Dick Cheney may shift among the Pentagon 's individual programs , projects and activities , allowing him to ease the pain that the Gramm-Rudman budget law was intended to inflict .
wsj_1413	2	If the request is approved by both the House and Senate , Mr. Cheney would need only permission from the White House Office of Management and Budget to move the money , according to Senate budget analysts .
wsj_1413	3	That would give the Pentagon flexibility that no other federal agency has .
wsj_1413	4	`` It 's simply a way of making the cuts less onerous for defense than they are for domestic programs , '' said Chairman James Sasser D. , Tenn . of the Senate Budget Committee , who said he would oppose the request .
wsj_1413	5	`` That is n't consistent with the kind of discipline that Gramm-Rudman is supposed to impose , '' he said .
wsj_1413	6	The president 's request did n't indicate how Mr. Cheney would shift the money .
wsj_1413	7	A Pentagon official said the request was made to give the department `` maximum flexibility '' to deal with the cuts .
wsj_1413	8	Last week , Budget Director Richard Darman structured the $ 16.1 billion spending reduction , half of which must come from defense , to `` impose a little bit more discipline '' by applying cuts to each individual program , project or activity in the budget .

wsj_1414	0	Rochester Telephone Corp. said it completed its purchase of Urban Telephone Corp. , of Clintonville , Wis. , the second-largest unaffiliated independent telephone company in that state .
wsj_1414	1	Rochester Telephone said the acquisition was made in an exchange of its common shares for all the shares of Urban Telephone , but a price was n't disclosed .
wsj_1414	2	Urban is the company 's first telephone subsidiary in Wisconsin .
wsj_1414	3	Since June , Rochester Telephone signed letters of intent to purchase three other Wisconsin firms .
wsj_1416	0	This letter was inspired by David Asman 's Sept. 25 editorial-page article about Fidel Castro , `` Man in the Middle of Drug Trafficking . ''
wsj_1416	1	I 've organized a series of exchanges , exhibitions and other continuing projects between Cuban and American artists .
wsj_1416	2	In any matters between us and the Cubans there can be no simplicity , consequently I 've become familiar not only with Cuban art and artists , but also with Cuban bureaucrats and their counterparts in our own government .
wsj_1416	3	Despite levels of obstruction , incompetence and ensuing frustration of mythic proportion , these projects all remain , in my mind , valuable and well worth the effort .
wsj_1416	4	There is a simple reason for this : the Cuban people .
wsj_1416	5	Let me immediately put limits to whatever nostalgic notions that may intimate .
wsj_1416	6	Those `` people '' to whom I refer are not some heroic , indecipherable quantity ; they are artists , critics , taxi drivers , grandmothers , even some employees of the Ministry of Culture , all of whom share a deep belief in the original principles of the Cuban Revolution , spelled out in terms such as equality among all members of the society , reverence for education and creative expression , universal rights to health and livelihood , housing , etc .
wsj_1416	7	In fact , the generation of painters growing into maturity right now works with such profoundly held humanist assumptions and such passionate commitment to moral and ethical principles that it makes Che Guevara 's famous linkages of art , idealism and revolution seem modest .
wsj_1416	8	It is on behalf of these people , and out of my real respect for them , that I am responding to Mr. Asman 's opinions of their country .
wsj_1416	9	The Ochoa trial in July , with its revelations of deeply rooted and widespread corruption , and the summary trial and execution , was extremely disturbing to everyone who has ever considered himself a friend of Cuba .
wsj_1416	10	However , unacceptable though those occurrences may have been , they still provide no excuse for wholesale departures from truth .
wsj_1416	11	Mr. Asman should make distinctions among Fidel , the army and the Cuban people .
wsj_1416	12	They are not interchangeable , since they are motivated to act based on their own circumstances .
wsj_1416	13	It is naivete to equate a government 's policies with the will of the people as we well know , and it is even worse folly to merge the clearly divergent agendas of Fidel and the military and the state bureaucracy .
wsj_1416	14	Mr. Asman is also annoyed that Mr. Castro has resisted collaboration with U.S. officials , even though by his own account that collaboration has been devised essentially as a mechanism for acts directly hostile to the Cuban regime , such as facilitating defections .
wsj_1416	15	I think it 's a little disingenuous to be surprised that Fidel does n't invite the U.S. State Department to violate the jurisdiction of the Cuban government over its own territory .
wsj_1416	16	We badly need to follow fact rather than the rhetoric of conventional wisdom .
wsj_1416	17	Without this basic level of attention to reality , our policies on Cuba will continue to be as counterproductive as they have for 30 years .
wsj_1416	18	From my own point of view , given the qualities of humanity , creativity and warm spirit in which the Cuban people excel , we deny ourselves access to things we hold dear , and which seem to run in such short supply these days .
wsj_1416	19	There is no rational justification for such behavior .

wsj_1418	0	Investors bailed out of New York City bonds in droves last week , driving prices lower and boosting yields .
wsj_1418	1	One bond trader estimated that more than $ 50 million of New York City general obligation bonds were put up for sale Friday alone .
wsj_1418	2	While that represents a small percentage of the city 's public debt outstanding , Friday 's selling followed a weeklong effort to unload the bonds by a broad spectrum of institutional and individual investors .
wsj_1418	3	`` I 've never seen so many New York City G.O. 's up for sale , '' said another trader .
wsj_1418	4	`` Every broker has blocks of every size and maturity . ''
wsj_1418	5	Municipal bond analysts said the sell-off was triggered by concerns about the city 's financial health , rumors of a $ 900 million bond offering coming soon , and political uncertainty .
wsj_1418	6	A spokesman for the city would n't confirm the size of the bond issue , but did say that a general obligation offering is in the works and should be priced sometime in the next two weeks , before the November mayoral election .
wsj_1418	7	General obligation bonds are backed by the city 's overall revenues and credit . )
wsj_1418	8	Although many investors were aware that a bond offering was being scheduled , many expected a much smaller amount of bonds to be sold .
wsj_1418	9	The fact that the city will issue such a large amount of debt was interpreted as a sign that New York 's budgetary problems are more serious than had been expected .
wsj_1418	10	New York , one of the nation 's largest issuers of tax-exempt bonds , sold $ 750 million of municipal bonds just a few weeks ago .
wsj_1418	11	There have been reports for months that the city 's economy is weakening , as the October 1987 stock market crash continues to make itself felt .
wsj_1418	12	The recent sharp stock market decline exacerbated those concerns .
wsj_1418	13	Meanwhile , tax revenues are falling while the city 's spending needs are expanding .
wsj_1418	14	Rumors persisted last week that New York 's credit ratings -- single-A from Moody 's Investors Service Inc. and single-A-minus from Standard & Poor 's Corp. -- are at risk .
wsj_1418	15	The weakness in New York City bonds follows a warning from New York state Comptroller Edward Regan that the 1987 crash seriously weakened the city 's economy .
wsj_1418	16	In a study , the comptroller said , `` The city 's glory days are over . ''
wsj_1418	17	Mr. Regan warned mayoral candidates `` to be prepared for limited options and constraints on service increases to address the city 's problems in the next few years , due to the now-evident weakening in the New York City economy . ''
wsj_1418	18	New York City 's revised financial plan , due out later this month , is expected to include measures to balance the city 's $ 27 billion budget .
wsj_1418	19	At present , analysts project a budget gap on the order of $ 500 million to $ 600 million for the fiscal year ending June 30 , 1990 , although the city 's own budget analysts project a narrower deficit .
wsj_1418	20	Mark Page , New York 's deputy director of finance , said that investors ' concerns about the city 's financial health are `` unwarranted given our proven ability to manage ourselves . ''
wsj_1418	21	He charges the city 's critics with spreading `` unfounded emotional rhetoric . ''
wsj_1418	22	There are also questions about whether a new and inexperienced mayor can manage the city through what could become a financial crisis .
wsj_1418	23	The leading contender for the mayoral office , Democrat David Dinkins , has been criticized recently for the way he handled his personal financial affairs .
wsj_1418	24	And the controversy has led to uncertainty about the outcome of the election .
wsj_1418	25	Until last week , Mr. Dinkins was considered a shoo-in .
wsj_1418	26	`` The market can adjust to good news or bad news , but uncertainty drives people wild , '' said Bernard B. Beal , chief executive of M.R. Beal & Co. , a securities firm that specializes in the municipal market .
wsj_1418	27	Until last week , `` Everyone felt certain they knew the outcome of the election .
wsj_1418	28	Now , there have been a number of questions raised . ''
wsj_1418	29	Last week , yields on long-term New York City general obligation bonds jumped half a percentage point .
wsj_1418	30	New York City 's 6 % bonds due 2018 , for example , were quoted late Friday at a price to yield 7.80 % , compared with 7.60 % Thursday .
wsj_1418	31	As the yield on New York general obligation bonds rose , the Bond Buyer 20-bond general obligation index , the mostly widely followed gauge of the tax-exempt market , held steady at 7.19 % in the week ended Oct. 19 .

wsj_1423	0	When the Supreme Court upheld Missouri 's abortion restrictions last July , the justices almost certainly did n't have drunk driving , trespassing and false imprisonment on their minds .
wsj_1423	1	But the 5-4 ruling may have had as much immediate impact on those activities -- especially trespassing -- as on abortion rights .
wsj_1423	2	The decision , Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services , illustrates how Supreme Court rulings often have a ripple effect , spreading into areas of law and policy that were n't part of the actual cases decided and that never were contemplated by the justices .
wsj_1423	3	In the Missouri case , unforeseen consequences may have arisen because the high court reinstated the preamble of the state 's 1986 abortion law .
wsj_1423	4	The preamble says that human life begins at conception and that unborn children have rights protected by the Constitution .
wsj_1423	5	Last year , a federal appeals court in St. Louis said the preamble was unconstitutional , citing an earlier Supreme Court ruling that states ca n't justify stricter abortion curbs by changing the definition of when life begins .
wsj_1423	6	But the Supreme Court concluded that it was premature to rule on the constitutionality of the preamble because the definition of human life had n't yet been used to restrict abortion services .
wsj_1423	7	The high court majority said it was up to the state courts for now to decide whether the definition has any bearing on other state laws .
wsj_1423	8	Already , local Missouri judges have relied on the restored preamble in two separate cases to throw out criminal trespass charges against anti-abortion demonstrators who blocked access to Reproductive Health Services , an abortion clinic in St. Louis .
wsj_1423	9	The protesters said their actions were justified by the desire to save the lives of unborn children .
wsj_1423	10	Under a 1981 Missouri law , persons accused of some crimes , including trespassing , may offer a defense that their actions were justified `` as an emergency measure to avoid an imminent public or private injury . ''
wsj_1423	11	Relying on the preamble 's statement that a fetus is an unborn child , the two St. Louis County Circuit Court judges in August accepted the justification that the abortion clinic protesters were trying to save lives .
wsj_1423	12	In another case , a protester , Ann O'Brien , was convicted of trespass before the Supreme Court 's Webster ruling .
wsj_1423	13	Last week , when her appeal was argued before the Missouri Court of Appeals , her lawyer also relied on the preamble .
wsj_1423	14	`` The effect of the Supreme Court Webster opinion is that it left room for grass to grow in the cracks of Roe vs. Wade , and I think this is one of the cracks , '' said Mark Belz , a St. Louis lawyer who represented Ms. O'Brien and the other St. Louis protesters .
wsj_1423	15	Roe vs. Wade was the Supreme Court 's 1973 decision that recognized a woman 's right to abortion .
wsj_1423	16	Mario Mandina , president of Kansas City Lawyers for Life , says that if abortion foes succeed in using the preamble to escape prosecution for trespass , `` This will shut down abortion in Missouri .
wsj_1423	17	There 's no risk to the protesters , and you ca n't keep an abortion clinic open if there are 3,000 people standing outside every day . ''
wsj_1423	18	That would be an ironic result of a case in which the Supreme Court expressly stopped short of overruling Roe vs. Wade .
wsj_1423	19	In two other cases , the possible consequences of the Supreme Court ruling appear even more unintended .
wsj_1423	20	In one , the lawyer for a 20-year-old resident of Columbia , Mo. , who was charged with drunk driving , argued that his client should be treated as a 21-year-old adult because his actual age should be calculated from conception , not from birth .
wsj_1423	21	In Missouri , those caught drinking and driving between the ages of 16 and 21 may have their licenses revoked for one year , while those 21 or older suffer only a 30-day suspension .
wsj_1423	22	A Boone County judge rejected the motion , but Daniel Dodson , a Jefferson City lawyer , says he has appealed .
wsj_1423	23	And in a case filed in federal court in August , a lawyer is arguing that Missouri authorities are wrongfully imprisoning the fetus of a pregnant woman who is in jail for theft and forgery .

wsj_1429	0	In a blow to France 's Rafale jet fighter , the French navy for the first time publicly stated its desire to buy 15 McDonnell Douglas Corp. F-18 Hornets to defend its aircraft carriers .
wsj_1429	1	The statement is likely to sharpen the debate within France 's military establishment over the Rafale , which is made by Avions Marcel Dassault-Breguet Aviation SA .
wsj_1429	2	In an interview in the navy 's official weekly magazine Cols Bleus , the navy 's second-in-command , Adm. Yves Goupil , said the navy still intends to buy 86 Rafales as scheduled in the late 1990s and early 21st century .
wsj_1429	3	The air force is to take at least 250 more .
wsj_1429	4	Adm. Goupil said the navy ca n't wait until 1998 , when the naval Rafale becomes available , to replace its obsolete fleet of American-made Crusaders , used since the 1950s to protect carriers from attack .
wsj_1429	5	Rather than renovate the Crusaders , which Dassault is proposing to do for around 1.8 billion French francs $ 286.6 million , Adm. Goupil said the navy wants to buy used F-18s from the U.S. Navy .
wsj_1429	6	Officially , the statement is n't an attack on the Rafale .
wsj_1429	7	Adm. Goupil said that when the F-18s wear out , the navy is prepared to take Rafales to replace them .
wsj_1429	8	But unofficially , senior navy officials sharply criticize the Rafale as an air force plane ill-suited to carrier use .
wsj_1429	9	Although they never said so publicly , they have made no secret of their preference for the F-18 on operational grounds .
wsj_1429	10	Adm. Goupil 's comments are likely to inflame the broader dispute within the military establishment here over the role of Dassault .
wsj_1429	11	Although government-controlled , Dassault still is run by the founder 's son , Chairman Serge Dassault , who has fiercely protected his company 's independence .
wsj_1429	12	The Rafale project is the result of France 's inability jointly to develop a plane with other countries , and French officials question whether the state can continue paying for expensive independent programs .
wsj_1429	13	So far , Mr. Dassault has resisted pressure to change .
wsj_1429	14	What brought the naval issue to a head is that the Crusaders are literally falling apart , without any immediate plan to replace them .
wsj_1429	15	Adm. Goupil , a former Crusader squadron leader , said that the last other country to use Crusaders , the Philippines , retired its last ones two years ago .
wsj_1429	16	A French Crusader crash a few months ago heightened pressure for new planes here .
wsj_1429	17	Adm. Goupil rejected Dassault 's proposal to renovate the Crusaders , saying the cost was impossible to estimate .
wsj_1429	18	Even modernized , he said , the Crusaders represent an obsolete and dangerous protection for the aircraft carriers France has sent to meet such crises as the wars in Lebanon and the Persian Gulf .
wsj_1429	19	Defense Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement told a meeting of the Anglo-American Press Association that the question of modernizing the Crusaders or buying used F18s is a `` political '' decision that he will make in due time .

wsj_1432	0	For Cathay Pacific Airways , the smooth ride may be ending .
wsj_1432	1	The first signs of trouble came last month when the Hong Kong carrier , a subsidiary of Swire Pacific Ltd. , posted a 5 % drop in operating profit for the first six months and warned that margins will remain under pressure for the rest of the year .
wsj_1432	2	Securities analysts , many of whom scrapped their buy recommendations after seeing Cathay 's interim figures , believe more jolts lie ahead .
wsj_1432	3	Fuel and personnel costs are rising , and tourism in and through Hong Kong remains clouded by China 's turmoil since the June 4 killings in Beijing .
wsj_1432	4	In addition , delivery delays for the first two of as many as 28 Boeing 747-400s that the carrier has ordered have raised costs because personnel had been hired to man the planes .
wsj_1432	5	And tough competition in the air-freight market is cutting into an important sideline .
wsj_1432	6	There also is concern that once Hong Kong reverts to China 's sovereignty in 1997 , Cathay will be forced to play second fiddle to China 's often-disparaged flag carrier , Civil Aviation Administration of China , or CAAC .
wsj_1432	7	`` The sense is we would never be in a position again where everything works for us the way it did before , '' says Rod Eddington , Cathay 's commercial director .
wsj_1432	8	Sarah Hall , an analyst at James Capel Far East Ltd. , says there is n't much Cathay can do about rising costs for jet fuel , Hong Kong 's tight labor market , or the strengthening of the local currency , which is pegged to the U.S. dollar .
wsj_1432	9	These factors are further complicated by the airline 's push to transform itself from a regional carrier to an international one , Ms. Hall says .
wsj_1432	10	Ms. Hall expects Cathay 's profit to grow around 13 % annually this year and next .
wsj_1432	11	In 1988 , it earned $ 2.82 billion Hong Kong US$ 361.5 million on revenue of HK$ 11.79 billion .
wsj_1432	12	Cathay is taking several steps to bolster business .
wsj_1432	13	One step is to beef up its fleet .
wsj_1432	14	In addition to aircraft from Boeing Co. , Cathay announced earlier this year an order for as many as 20 Airbus A330-300s .
wsj_1432	15	The expansion , which could cost as much as US$ 5.7 billion over the next eight years , will expand the fleet to about 43 planes by 1991 , up from 30 at the end of last year , according to Sun Hung Kai Securities Ltd .
wsj_1432	16	The fuel-efficient Airbus planes will be used largely to replace Cathay 's aging fleet of Lockheed Tristars for regional flights , while the Boeing aircraft will be used on long-haul routes to Europe and North America .
wsj_1432	17	Cathay also is moving some of its labor-intensive data-processing operations outside Hong Kong .
wsj_1432	18	Fierce bidding for young employees in Hong Kong is pushing up Cathay 's labor costs by 20 % a year for low-level staff , while experienced , skilled employees are leaving the colony as part of the brain drain .
wsj_1432	19	Some jobs already have been moved to Australia , and there are plans to place others in Canada .
wsj_1432	20	David Bell , a spokesman for the airline , says the move is partly aimed at retaining existing staff who are leaving to secure foreign passports ahead of 1997 .
wsj_1432	21	Cathay is working to promote Hong Kong as a destination worth visiting on its own merits , rather than just a stopover .
wsj_1432	22	Although the June 4 killings in Beijing have hurt its China flights , Cathay 's other routes have retained high load factors .
wsj_1432	23	Mr. Eddington regards promoting Hong Kong as an important part of attracting visitors from Japan , South Korea and Taiwan , where the number of people looking to travel abroad has surged .
wsj_1432	24	There also has been speculation that Cathay will be among the major private-sector participants in the Hong Kong government 's plans to build a new airport , with the carrier possibly investing in its own terminal .
wsj_1432	25	Cathay officials decline to comment on the speculation .
wsj_1432	26	Mr. Eddington sees alliances with other carriers -- particularly Cathay 's recent link with AMR Corp. 's American Airlines -- as an important part of Cathay 's strategy .
wsj_1432	27	But he emphasizes that Cathay has n't any interest in swapping equity stakes with the U.S. carrier or with Lufthansa , the West German airline with which it has cooperated for about a decade .
wsj_1432	28	Analysts believe Cathay is approached for such swaps by other carriers on a regular basis , particularly as the popularity of share exchanges has grown among European carriers .
wsj_1432	29	`` We think alliances are very important , '' Mr. Eddington says .
wsj_1432	30	`` But we 'd rather put funds into our own business rather than someone else 's .
wsj_1432	31	I 'm not sure cross-ownership would necessarily make things smoother . ''
wsj_1432	32	In a pattern it aims to copy in several key U.S. destinations , Cathay recently announced plans to serve San Francisco by flying into American Airlines ' Los Angeles hub and routing continuing passengers onto a flight on the U.S. carrier .
wsj_1432	33	`` We 'll never have a big operation in the U.S. , and they 'll never have one as big as us in the Pacific , '' Mr. Eddington says .
wsj_1432	34	`` But this way , American will coordinate good extensions to Boston , New York , Chicago and Dallas .
wsj_1432	35	We 'll coordinate on this end to places like Bangkok , Singapore and Manila . ''
wsj_1432	36	Asian traffic , which currently accounts for 65 % of Cathay 's business , is expected to continue as the carrier 's mainstay .
wsj_1432	37	Cathay has long stated its desire to double its weekly flights into China to 14 , and it is applying to restart long-canceled flights into Vietnam .
wsj_1432	38	Further expansion into southern Europe is also possible , says Mr. Bell , the spokesman .
wsj_1432	39	While a large number of Hong Kong companies have reincorporated offshore ahead of 1997 , such a move is n't an option for Cathay because it would jeopardize its landing rights in Hong Kong .
wsj_1432	40	And Mr. Eddington emphatically rules out a move to London : `` Our lifeblood is Hong Kong traffic rights . ''
wsj_1432	41	He says the airline is putting its faith in the Sino-British agreement on Hong Kong 's return to China .
wsj_1432	42	A special section dealing with aviation rights states that landing rights for Hong Kong 's airlines , which include the smaller Hong Kong Dragon Airlines , will continue to be negotiated by Hong Kong 's government .
wsj_1432	43	But critics fret that post-1997 officials ultimately will be responsible to Beijing .
wsj_1432	44	`` My feeling is Cathay does n't have a hope in the long run , '' says an analyst , who declines to be identified .
wsj_1432	45	`` Cathay would love to keep going , but the general sense is they 're going to have to do something . ''
wsj_1432	46	Mr. Eddington acknowledges that the carrier will have to evolve and adapt to local changes , but he feels that the Sino-British agreement is firm ground to build on for the foreseeable future .
wsj_1432	47	`` We 're confident that it protects our route structure , '' he says , `` and our ability to grow and prosper .

wsj_1439	0	Dow Chemical Co. said its Destec Energy Inc. unit has agreed to buy PSE Inc. , a Houston energy company , in a deal valued at about $ 115 million .
wsj_1439	1	Dow , of Midland , Mich. , said its unit will begin by Thursday a tender offer of $ 12.25 a share for all PSE common shares outstanding .
wsj_1439	2	Among other conditions , the offer depends on the Dow unit acquiring at least 66 2/3 % of the PSE shares outstanding , the companies said in a joint statement Friday .
wsj_1439	3	PSE has about 9.2 million shares outstanding .
wsj_1439	4	The company said the approximately $ 115 million acquisition price includes its total $ 33 million of long-term debt outstanding .
wsj_1439	5	Dow said it already has agreements with Albert J. Smith Jr. , chairman and chief executive officer of PSE , and certain other officers of the company under which Dow may buy about 40 % of the PSE common shares outstanding .
wsj_1439	6	PSE is a designer and operator of energy-cogeneration facilities and had 1988 sales of $ 234 million .
wsj_1439	7	The company is owner and operator , or an equity partner , in six cogeneration facilities -- two in Texas and four in California .

wsj_1441	0	The following were among Friday 's offerings and pricings in the U.S. and non-U.S. capital markets , with terms and syndicate manager , as compiled by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report :
wsj_1441	1	Chicago & North Western Acquisition Corp. -- $ 475 million of senior subordinated resettable debentures , due Oct. 15 , 2001 , priced at par to yield 14.75 % .
wsj_1441	2	The coupon will be reset in one year at a rate that will give the issue a market value of 101 .
wsj_1441	3	However , the maximum coupon rate on the issue when it is reset can only be 15.5 % .
wsj_1441	4	Debenture holders will also receive the equivalent of 10 % of the common stock of CNW Holdings .
wsj_1441	5	The equity kicker is not attached to the offering , but underwriters said it will be offered after a filing for 68,548 common shares of CNW Holdings is declared effective by the Securities & Exchange Commission .
wsj_1441	6	The issue is noncallable for five years and has a sinking fund starting in 2000 to retire 50 % of the issue before maturity .
wsj_1441	7	Rated single-B-2 by Moody 's Investors Service Inc. and single-B-minus by Standard & Poor 's Corp. , the issue will be sold through underwriters led by Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp .

wsj_1443	0	Immunex Corp. said its scientists isolated a molecule which may hold potential as a treatment for disruptions of the immune-system , ranging from organ-transplant rejection , to allergies and asthma .
wsj_1443	1	The molecule is the mouse version of a protein called the interleukin-4 receptor .
wsj_1443	2	IL-4 is a hormone which directs the growth and function of white blood cells involved in the body 's immune response .
wsj_1443	3	The IL-4 receptor on the surface of such cells receives the hormone 's message to rally the body 's defense .
wsj_1443	4	But in certain conditions such as autoimmune diseases and allergies and transplant rejection , doctors would like to damp the immune response so such cells do n't touch off harmful inflammatory reactions or cell destruction .
wsj_1443	5	A soluble form of the receptor might turn off a specific part of the immune response without general immune suppression , the company said .
wsj_1443	6	The IL-4 receptor is one of five such receptors to be developed and tested by Receptech Corp. , a spinoff of Immunex , through a proposed $ 30 million initial public offering .
wsj_1443	7	Immunex will contract with the spinoff to provide the research , development and initial testing of the new agents .
wsj_1443	8	Immunex will have the option to buy back Receptech shares after five years .

wsj_1446	0	Move over , pornographic phone services : A legal service with a `` 900 '' number has been launched in California .
wsj_1446	1	A Newport Beach law firm started the pay-as-you-go legal service , called Telelawyer , using MCI Communication Corp. 's toll-tele-phone service .
wsj_1446	2	Cane & Associates touts its $ 2-a-minute service as the `` cheapest legal hour you 'll ever find . ''
wsj_1446	3	Though the service is available only in California , Telelawyer founder Michael Cane says he plans to franchise it in other states .
wsj_1446	4	He says his aim is to reach people who are bedridden , have no access to transportation , ca n't find a lawyer to take their case or simply ca n't afford lawyers ' consultation fees .
wsj_1446	5	Mr. Cane stresses that he is n't using the telephone to lure clients to his doorstep .
wsj_1446	6	`` We will only deal with clients on the phone , '' he says .
wsj_1446	7	`` We have no in-office business . ''
wsj_1446	8	Telelawyer is apparently the only telephone service that offers the telephone equivalent of an office visit .
wsj_1446	9	Local bar associations in some states have numbers that provide free tape-recorded messages explaining certain areas of the law .
wsj_1446	10	There also are `` 800 '' hotlines which refer people to lawyers , usually personal-injury specialists , for in-office consultation .
wsj_1446	11	When a caller reaches Telelawyer by dialing 900-TELELAW , a receptionist refers the call to one of six attorneys .
wsj_1446	12	In an effort to determine whether a caller has reason to sue , Cane lawyers review documents and perform research , if necessary , with the help of three law clerks and several support staffers .
wsj_1446	13	There is no charge for research -- only for time on the phone .
wsj_1446	14	If the matter requires further legal work or litigation , Mr. Cane says , his lawyers may refer the client to a law firm .
wsj_1446	15	But he says Cane & Associates does n't receive referral fees .
wsj_1446	16	So far , says Mr. Cane , most calls have involved landlord-tenant problems , tax problems , divorce , and probate questions .
wsj_1446	17	The firm is getting about 50 calls a day , and the average call lasts about 15 minutes .
wsj_1446	18	Out of the $ 2 charge , the law firm pockets about $ 1.55 .
wsj_1446	19	JURY CONVICTS congressman in connection with Wedtech Corp. scandal .
wsj_1446	20	A federal court jury in New York found U.S. Rep. Robert Garcia D. , N.Y . and his wife , Jane Lee Garcia , guilty of extorting $ 76,000 from Wedtech in return for official acts by the congressman .
wsj_1446	21	The jury also convicted them of extortion in obtaining a $ 20,000 , interest-free loan from a Wedtech officer .
wsj_1446	22	The jury found them guilty of conspiracy in obtaining the payments , some of which were disguised as fees for consulting services from Mrs. Garcia .
wsj_1446	23	Wedtech , which became embroiled in political-corruption cases that eventually led to its demise , formerly was a minority-owned South Bronx , N.Y. , defense contractor .
wsj_1446	24	Edward J.M. Little , one of the assistant U.S. attorneys who prosecuted the case , said the Garcia trial `` is the last of the Wedtech prosecutions . ''
wsj_1446	25	Mr. Little said more than 20 people have been convicted in the Wedtech cases , including former U.S. Rep. Mario Biaggi D. , N.Y . .
wsj_1446	26	Lawyers for the Garcias said they plan to appeal .
wsj_1446	27	Mr. Garcia , who represents New York 's 18th congressional district , which includes the Bronx , said he has n't decided whether he will resign .
wsj_1446	28	`` In the next few weeks , I will be consulting with my political advisers and with the Democratic leaders about the best way of preserving the interests of my constituents , '' said Mr. Garcia , 56 years old .
wsj_1446	29	Mrs. Garcia , 49 , formerly was a member of Mr. Garcia 's congressional staff .
wsj_1446	30	The Garcias were cleared of four other felony counts , involving the receipt of bribes and gratuities .
wsj_1446	31	U.S. Judge Leonard B. Sand set the Garcias ' sentencing for Jan. 5 .
wsj_1446	32	FIVE SHEA & GOULD PARTNERS are leaving to form a new firm .
wsj_1446	33	The new firm , Hutton Ingram Yuzek Gainen Carroll & Bertolotti , will be based in New York .
wsj_1446	34	The five partners who resigned from Shea & Gould late last week are Tom Hutton , Sam Ingram , Dean Yuzek , Daniel Carroll and Ernest Bertolotti .
wsj_1446	35	They will be joined by Larry Gainen , who resigned from the firm of LePatner , Gainen & Block .
wsj_1446	36	Howard Rubenstein , a New York publicist who represents Shea & Gould , said , `` Shea & Gould understands they 're leaving because they wanted a different environment -- a smaller firm they would be principals of . ''
wsj_1446	37	Mr. Rubenstein said the five , who were n't on Shea & Gould 's management committee , `` are leaving on good terms . ''
wsj_1446	38	He said Shea & Gould held a number of discussions with the five partners during the past few weeks to get them to stay but that the five were firmly committed to running their own firm .
wsj_1446	39	Hutton Ingram will have a general corporate , securities , real-estate and litigation practice , and a substantial practice serving the professional-design community .
wsj_1446	40	DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS against lawyers open to public in Illinois .
wsj_1446	41	While investigations into lawyer misconduct will remain secret , the public will be notified once a formal complaint is filed against an attorney .
wsj_1446	42	The actual disciplinary hearings will be public .
wsj_1446	43	In addition , Illinois attorneys will lose the right to sue clients who file malicious complaints against them .
wsj_1446	44	Non-lawyers will be added to the inquiry panels that look into allegations of misconduct .
wsj_1446	45	Illinois joins 36 other states that allow public participation in attorney-disciplinary proceedings and 32 states that open disciplinary hearings to the public , according to the American Bar Association .
wsj_1446	46	One vocal critic of the changes , Chicago lawyer Warren Lupel , says non-lawyers should n't be on the inquiry panels because they are unlikely to appreciate the nuances of attorney-client relationships .
wsj_1446	47	In addition , he says , publishing the names of lawyers who are facing charges unnecessarily subjects them to public derogation .
wsj_1446	48	Nevertheless , Mr. Lupel anticipates no legal action to reverse the Illinois Supreme Court 's decision to institute the changes .
wsj_1446	49	`` There 's no constitutional right involved in the rule change , '' he says .
wsj_1446	50	`` You do n't have a right to practice .
wsj_1446	51	You only have a privilege to practice . ''
wsj_1446	52	DREXEL BURNHAM LAMBERT Inc. agreed to pay a $ 50,000 fine to Delaware , the 26th state to settle with Drexel in the wake of the firm 's guilty plea to federal insider-trading charges .
wsj_1446	53	Drexel does n't have a Delaware office , but the New York firm has been negotiating settlements that would allow it to operate freely nationwide despite its record as an admitted felon .
wsj_1446	54	The firm has said it expects to pay $ 11.5 million overall to settle with states .
wsj_1446	55	Drexel pleaded guilty in September to six felony counts of securities and mail fraud ; it also made a $ 650 million civil settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission .
wsj_1447	0	Philip Morris Cos. , whose Benson & Hedges cigarette brand has been losing market share , has asked at least one other agency to try its hand at creative work for the big account , which has been at Wells Rich Greene Inc. since 1966 .
wsj_1447	1	Executives close to Philip Morris said that the tobacco and food giant has asked Backer Spielvogel Bates Worldwide Inc. , a unit of Saatchi & Saatchi Co. , and possibly others to work on creative ideas for the account .
wsj_1447	2	Several executives said another potential contender is WPP Group 's Ogilvy & Mather agency , which works on some other Philip Morris products .
wsj_1447	3	Both Philip Morris and Backer Spielvogel declined to comment .
wsj_1447	4	A spokeswoman for Ogilvy & Mather said the agency does n't comment on `` idle speculation . ''
wsj_1447	5	Also mentioned as a contender was TBWA Advertising , but the company denied it was participating .
wsj_1447	6	The loss of the cigarette account would be a severe blow to Wells Rich .
wsj_1447	7	Benson & Hedges has been one of its most high-visibility campaigns , as well as one of its largest clients .
wsj_1447	8	The account billed almost $ 60 million last year , according to Leading National Advertisers .
wsj_1447	9	But Philip Morris has scaled back ad spending on the brand over the past year , industry executives said , and it now bills about $ 30 million to $ 40 million .
wsj_1447	10	Industry executives said Philip Morris had asked the other agencies to create campaigns in a bid to stop the brand 's slipping market share .
wsj_1447	11	According to John Maxwell , an analyst at Wheat First Securities , Richmond , Va. , Benson & Hedges has slipped from 4.7 % of the cigarette market in 1985 to just 4.1 % after the second quarter of this year .
wsj_1447	12	The brand is No. 7 overall in the cigarette business , Mr. Maxwell said .
wsj_1447	13	The slip has come despite high-profile ads created by Wells Rich , including one picturing a young man clad only in pajama bottoms interrupting a festive brunch .
wsj_1447	14	That ad generated so much publicity that a trade magazine launched a contest for its readers to guess who the guy was and what he was doing .
wsj_1447	15	Wells Rich first popularized the Benson & Hedges brand more than 20 years ago with ads portraying , among other things , an elevator door closing on a passenger 's cigarette .
wsj_1447	16	The brand early on achieved an upscale appeal -- a trait that some analysts believe is partly responsible for its staid performance .
wsj_1447	17	Philip Morris , trying to revive the Benson & Hedges franchise , put the account up for review in 1986 .
wsj_1447	18	Wells Rich Greene , however , in an effort directed by Mary Wells Lawrence , emerged the victor of the review and retained the business .
wsj_1447	19	Kenneth Olshan , Wells Rich 's chairman , did n't return phone calls seeking comment .
wsj_1447	20	While Wells Rich recently picked up Hertz Corp. 's $ 25 million to $ 30 million account , it has lost a number of big accounts this year , including the $ 20 million to $ 25 million Cadbury-Schweppes Canada Dry and Sunkist accounts , the $ 18 million Procter & Gamble Co . Sure deodorant account and the $ 10 million Polo/Ralph Lauren business .
wsj_1447	21	Its victories include more than $ 30 million in Sheraton Corp. business and an assignment from Dun & Bradstreet worth $ 5 million to $ 10 million .
wsj_1449	0	Bond Corp . Holdings Ltd. posted a loss for fiscal 1989 of 980.2 million Australian dollars US$ 762.4 million , the largest in Australian corporate history .
wsj_1449	1	That loss compared with a year-earlier profit of A$ 273.5 million .
wsj_1449	2	In preliminary , unaudited results reported Friday , Bond Corp. also posted an operating loss of A$ 814.1 million for the year ended June 30 , compared with operating profit of A$ 354.7 million a year earlier .
wsj_1449	3	Operating revenue rose 69 % to A$ 8.48 billion from A$ 5.01 billion .
wsj_1449	4	But the net interest bill jumped 85 % to A$ 686.7 million from A$ 371.1 million .
wsj_1449	5	Bond Corp. has interests in brewing , media and communications , natural resources and property .
wsj_1449	6	Much of Bond Corp. 's losses stemmed from one-time write-downs of the value of some of Bond Corp. 's assets and those of its units .
wsj_1449	7	The results included a A$ 453.4 million write-off of future income-tax benefits and a provision for a loss of A$ 149.5 million on the sale of a stake of about 20 % in Lonrho PLC .
wsj_1449	8	However , Bond Corp. said the tax benefits remain available and might be used later .
wsj_1449	9	Earnings before interest and tax from brewing dived 50 % to A$ 123.8 million from A$ 247.3 million .
wsj_1449	10	The company said the general financial performance of its U.S. brewing operations , G. Heileman Brewing Co. , was `` disappointing , and this has been reflected in the results . ''
wsj_1449	11	Bond Corp. 's shares closed Friday before news of the results at 28 Australian cents a share , up one Australian cent .
wsj_1449	12	The staggering losses cap a tumultuous year for Alan Bond and his flagship , Bond Corp .
wsj_1449	13	Only a year ago , the chairman of Bond Corp. , who controls about 58 % of the company , appeared to be building a war chest to attack some big companies .
wsj_1449	14	Now Bond Corp. has agreed to sell at least half its Australian brewing assets .
wsj_1449	15	It has sold billions of dollars of other assets and has more on the block .
wsj_1449	16	But in a TV interview Sunday Mr. Bond said , `` We 've taken a big loss .
wsj_1449	17	We 've taken it on the chin .
wsj_1449	18	But we 're out there and we 're going to stay in business .
wsj_1449	19	Bond Corp. signaled it will focus on building its domestic and international media and communications businesses .
wsj_1449	20	It said it will look at opportunities in brewing , property and energy resources to the extent consistent with the dominant objective of manageable debt-to-assets ratios .
wsj_1449	21	The result `` will ultimately be a very different group in size and structure , '' Bond Corp. directors said in a statement .
wsj_1449	22	Some analysts contend the total writeoffs should have been much greater , and Bond Corp. 's auditors cited a list of several assets and deals about which there is `` uncertainty '' regarding the current value and potential impact on the firm .
wsj_1449	23	Bond Corp. said the acknowledged losses mean net asset backing is in the red to the tune of 53 Australian cents a share , vs. positive asset backing of A$ 1.92 a share a year ago .
wsj_1449	24	Still , the directors said , `` Having fully considered all aspects of the company 's state of affairs and future cash flows , the directors confirm absolutely that the company is solvent . ''
wsj_1449	25	Indeed , in a note to the results , directors said if the `` true worth '' of some of the group 's assets were taken into account instead of using book values , the negative net asset backing a share would turn into `` a substantial positive '' one .
wsj_1451	0	ENFIELD Corp. said in Toronto that it hopes to raise 56 million Canadian dollars US$ 47.7 million through a rights offering to shareholders .
wsj_1451	1	Under the offer , shareholders can purchase one Enfield share at C$ 6.27 for each five shares held .
wsj_1451	2	In Toronto Stock Exchange trading Friday , Enfield closed at C$ 6.75 , down 37.5 cents .
wsj_1451	3	The holding company said the rights offering should reduce its C$ 171 million debt to `` more manageable levels '' before Dec. 31 and allow it to finance future investments with equity capital .
wsj_1451	4	At last report , Enfield had about 44.5 million shares outstanding .

wsj_1454	0	Guardian Royal Exchange Assurance PLC , a major British composite insurer , said it is taking a stake in Nationwide Anglia Building Society 's estate agency business as part of a plan to create a range of commercial linkages in the U.K. and Europe .
wsj_1454	1	Officials declined to disclose the value of the transaction or the exact stake that GRE will hold in Nationwide Anglia Estate Agents .
wsj_1454	2	But the companies said that Nationwide Anglia Estate Agents will market GRE life insurance , pension and investment products through its more than 1,000 retail outlets in the U.K .
wsj_1454	3	Besides the marketing agreement , GRE said Nationwide Anglia has agreed to develop life insurance products with the composite insurer .
wsj_1456	0	Pittston Co. 's third-quarter net income plunged 79 % , reflecting the impact of a prolonged and bitter labor strike at its coal operations .
wsj_1456	1	Net sank to $ 3.1 million , or eight cents a share , including $ 789,000 , or two cents a share , reflecting a tax-loss carry-forward .
wsj_1456	2	In the year-ago quarter , net totaled $ 14.7 million , or 38 cents a share , including $ 4 million , or 10 cents a share , reflecting a tax-loss carry-forward .
wsj_1456	3	Revenue slipped 0.7 % to $ 395.3 million from $ 398.3 million .
wsj_1456	4	Pittston also owns Brink 's Inc. , the security service , and Burlington Air Express , the air-freight concern .
wsj_1456	5	In addition to expected losses tied to the labor strike , the coal group has spent almost $ 20 million since the strike began for security , the company said .
wsj_1456	6	As a result , the group 's third-quarter loss widened to $ 9.8 million from the second quarter 's $ 3.6 million .
wsj_1456	7	Pittston continues to hire replacement workers , the company said .
wsj_1456	8	Burlington 's operating profit grew to $ 9.2 million from $ 3.8 million a year earlier , Pittston said .
wsj_1456	9	While `` the tone '' of domestic and international air-freight markets remains sound , seasonal factors are likely to hinder Burlington Air from matching third-quarter results in the fourth quarter , Pittston said .
wsj_1456	10	Brink 's operating profit was about flat with the year-earlier period , reflecting continued pricing and cost pressures .
wsj_1456	11	In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday , Pittston closed at $ 18.50 a share , down 12.5 cents .
wsj_1458	0	The long-running scandal surrounding the 1982 collapse of Banco Ambrosiano was reignited by the arrest last week of Rome businessman Flavio Carboni on fraud charges .
wsj_1458	1	Rome magistrates accuse Mr. Carboni and several other people of trying to extort 1.2 billion lire $ 880,000 from the Vatican in return for documents contained in the briefcase of Roberto Calvi , the Ambrosiano chairman found hanged under London 's Blackfriar 's Bridge shortly before the bank 's collapse .
wsj_1458	2	Banco Ambrosiano , which was Italy 's largest private-sector bank , collapsed in 1982 with $ 1.3 billion of debts .
wsj_1458	3	Most of the money was lent to a series of shell companies in Panama and Luxembourg that were owned , directly or indirectly , by the Vatican bank .
wsj_1458	4	The Vatican , which denies any wrongdoing , paid $ 250 million to the Milan bank 's creditors as a `` goodwill gesture '' in 1985 .
wsj_1458	5	Italian news reports said Mr. Carboni and a colleague obtained 1.2 billion lire in checks from a Vatican official , Pavel Hnilica .
wsj_1458	6	Italian papers speculated the briefcase contained papers either exonerating the Vatican bank from blame in the scandal , or showing that the bank , known as the Istituto per le Opere di Religione , channeled funds to East bloc groups such as Solidarity in Poland .
wsj_1458	7	Neither Mr. Hnilica , Mr. Carboni nor Vatican officials could be reached for comment over the weekend .
wsj_1459	0	This business trust company said its board elected Kieran E. Burke , a consultant to Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc. , as chief executive officer , a new post , and as president .
wsj_1459	1	Mr. Burke succeeds Richard D. Manley , who will remain as a consultant to the company .
wsj_1459	2	Both men were unavailable to comment .
wsj_1459	3	The company also named Michael E. Gellert , a director and a major shareholder , to fill the vacant seat of chairman .
wsj_1460	0	Britain 's Serious Fraud Office said it will investigate the circumstances surrounding alleged phantom contracts at Ferranti International Signal PLC 's International Signal & Control unit .
wsj_1460	1	The investigation , which will be coordinated with one already under way in the U.S. , follows the discovery of what Ferranti has called a `` serious '' fraud involving its U.S. subsidiary .
wsj_1460	2	International Signal & Control , Lancaster , Pa. , a defense-equipment manufacturer , was bought by Ferranti in 1987 for # 420 million $ 670.3 million .
wsj_1460	3	Ferranti has said that it would be forced to write off # 185 million against the phantom contracts , reducing its net asset value by more than half .
wsj_1460	4	The Serious Fraud Office , a division of London 's Metropolitan Police responsible for investigating financial crimes , said its work would take in `` allegations of fraud prior to , surrounding and subsequent to the merger . ''
wsj_1460	5	Ferranti said that it welcomes the investigation and that it will `` cooperate fully . ''
wsj_1460	6	Derek Alun-Jones , Ferranti 's chairman , has said he hoped to pursue legal action against those responsible .
wsj_1460	7	The British defense electronics group has said it will sell # 100 million in assets and may seek a merger to strengthen itself in the wake of its troubles .
wsj_1461	0	Chicago businessmen Bertram M. Lee and Peter Bynoe signed a new agreement to purchase the Denver Nuggets basketball team , but not as principal owners .
wsj_1461	1	On Saturday , the partners said the team would be purchased for $ 54 million by a new group including Comsat Video Enterprises Inc. , a unit of Communications Satellite Corp. based here .
wsj_1461	2	Comsat Video will pay $ 17 million for a 62.5 % interest , with Messrs. Lee and Bynoe putting up $ 8 million for a 37.5 % stake in the team .
wsj_1461	3	Under terms of the sale , Nuggets owner Sidney Shlenker could receive up to $ 11 million in additional payments from the franchise 's future earnings .
wsj_1461	4	Messrs. Lee and Bynoe last July announced a deal that would have made them the first black principal owners of a major professional sports franchise .
wsj_1461	5	But the deal fell apart last week for lack of financing .
wsj_1461	6	Comsat Video is headed by Robert Wussler , who resigned his No. 2 executive post with Turner Broadcasting System Inc. just two weeks ago to take the Comsat position .
wsj_1461	7	Comsat Video , which distributes pay-per-view programs to hotel rooms , plans to add Nuggets games to their offerings , as Mr. Turner did successfully with his Atlanta Hawks and Braves sports teams .
wsj_1461	8	Messrs. Lee and Bynoe will manage the Nuggets ' day-today affairs .
wsj_1462	0	Royal Business Group Inc. said it filed suit in federal court here charging Realist Inc. and its directors with violating federal securities laws `` by engaging in a scheme to prevent '' Royal from acquiring Realist .
wsj_1462	1	Royal , which makes and distributes business forms , owns an 8 % stake in Realist .
wsj_1462	2	Royal contends that Realist failed to disclose material information , including Realist 's negotiations to acquire Ammann Laser Technik AG , to stockholders prior to Realist 's June 6 annual meeting .
wsj_1462	3	Royal 's suit contends that the Ammann acquisition was `` designed to entrench management and thwart Royal 's offer . ''
wsj_1462	4	Royal withdrew its offer to buy Realist , a maker of optical and electronic products based in Menomonee Falls , Wis. , for $ 14.06 a share in July after Realist disclosed the Ammann purchase .
wsj_1462	5	The suit seeks `` in excess of $ 350,000 in damages . ''
wsj_1462	6	A Realist official said the company had n't yet received the full complaint and would n't have a response until it had an opportunity to review it .
wsj_1463	0	Winnebago Industries Inc. , battered by a deepening slowdown in recreational vehicle industry sales , reported a widened fourth-quarter loss and slashed its dividend in half .
wsj_1463	1	The Forest City , Iowa , maker of motor homes said it had a loss of $ 11.3 million , or 46 cents a share , in the quarter ended Aug. 26 .
wsj_1463	2	A year earlier , the company had a deficit of $ 1.5 million , or six cents a share .
wsj_1463	3	The cut in the dividend to 10 cents a share semiannually , from 20 cents , `` would indicate to me they do n't see the problems being fixed real quick , '' said Frank Rolfes , an analyst at Dain Bosworth Inc. in Minneapolis .
wsj_1463	4	Indeed , Winnebago said it started `` several promotional programs '' to spur retail sales in the fall and winter .
wsj_1463	5	The year was already shaping up as a difficult one for the recreational vehicle industry , which makes products such as motor homes , travel trailers , folding campers and van conversions .
wsj_1463	6	With the exception of van conversions , the industry has seen a decline from 1988 's robust sales .
wsj_1463	7	But the rate of the decline snowballed in August , with unit sales to dealers for the month down 10.5 % from a year earlier , according to the Recreation Vehicle Industry Association .
wsj_1463	8	At Winnebago , sales for the quarter fell 6 % to $ 89.5 million from $ 95.4 million a year earlier .
wsj_1463	9	The company attributed the decline to consumers ' concern over interest rates and gas prices -- two key expenses for RV buyers .
wsj_1463	10	`` It 's a large-ticket discretionary purchase , '' said Robert Curran , who follows the industry for Merrill Lynch & Co .
wsj_1463	11	`` So when there 's talk and concern about the economy , it 's not unreasonable for a portion of the buying public to defer purchases . ''
wsj_1463	12	Mr. Curran expects industry RV sales for all of 1989 to fall about 5 % from 1988 , when sales of 427,300 units were the highest since 1978 .
wsj_1463	13	And he said the weakness could continue in the first half of next year .
wsj_1463	14	But he said the industry has `` a good decade ahead , '' particularly if aging baby boomers fulfill the industry 's dreams by buying RVs .
wsj_1463	15	Winnebago was hit especially hard in the latest downturn because unit sales in its bread-and-butter motor home business tumbled 25 % industrywide in August , and 10.4 % in the first eight months of the year .
wsj_1463	16	The company said it also suffered in the quarter from incentive programs , losses from discontinuing a motor home line and costs of developing a new commercial vehicle , among other things .
wsj_1463	17	The news sent Winnebago stock falling 62.5 cents , to $ 5.25 , in New York Stock Exchange composite trading - a 52-week low .
wsj_1463	18	The dividend cut will prove most costly for John K. Hanson , Winnebago 's founder and chairman .
wsj_1463	19	Based on his control of about 45 % of Winnebago 's 24.7 million shares , his annual dividend income would be cut to about $ 2.2 million from $ 4.4 million .
wsj_1463	20	For the year , Winnebago had a loss of $ 4.7 million , or 19 cents a share , following profit of $ 2.7 million , or 11 cents a share , a year earlier .
wsj_1463	21	Sales rose 2 % to $ 437.5 million from $ 430.3 million .
wsj_1465	0	Sotheby 's Inc. 's gamble in the art-dealing business appears to have paid off .
wsj_1465	1	The New York arm of the London-based auction house auctioned off the estate of John T. Dorrance Jr. , the Campbell 's Soup Co. heir , for $ 131 million last week , a record for a single-owner art collection .
wsj_1465	2	That total was below the $ 140 million the auction house estimated the collection might sell for , but was enough to ensure that an unprecedented financial arrangement Sotheby 's had made with the Dorrance family proved profitable to the auction house .
wsj_1465	3	Sotheby 's provided the Dorrance family a guarantee of at least $ 100 million , and as much as $ 120 million , to obtain the collection , people familiar with the transaction said , thus taking a greater than usual financial interest in the property to be sold .
wsj_1465	4	The Dorrance estate , auctioned off in a series of sales held over four days , included porcelains , furniture and paintings .
wsj_1465	5	An Henri Matisse , auctioned last Wednesday , fetched $ 12.4 million , a world record for the artist .
wsj_1465	6	In addition , a handful of paintings from the Dorrance collection remain to be sold at Sotheby 's annual old masters paintings auction in January .
wsj_1466	0	The Better Business Bureau of San Diego and the state Attorney General 's office entered into a settlement stemming from an investigation of bureau-sponsored business directories published by an outside firm , Better Book Inc .
wsj_1466	1	The settlement stems from charges that Better Book , now defunct , made misrepresentations in selling advertising for the directories and memberships in the bureau from 1984 to 1986 .
wsj_1466	2	Without admitting any guilt , the bureau agreed to several conditions if it again contracts with an outside firm to publish its directories .
wsj_1466	3	The conditions include not misrepresenting how many directories will be distributed , and agreeing to make refunds to directory advertisers if any misrepresentations are involved in the sale .
wsj_1466	4	The Attorney General 's investigation was sparked by lawsuits and charges by angry California businesspeople that they were swindled in a bureau-sponsored directory project contracted by Better Book .
wsj_1466	5	The uproar led to the closing of the Los Angeles Better Business Bureau in late 1987 .
wsj_1467	0	McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. said it obtained `` firm '' financing commitments from three major banks in regard to its offer for 50.3 % of LIN Broadcasting Corp .
wsj_1467	1	Morgan Guaranty Trust , Toronto-Dominion Bank and Provident National Bank , an affiliate of PNC Financial Corp. , jointly committed $ 1.2 billion of financing , subject to certain conditions , McCaw said .
wsj_1467	2	Further , McCaw said the banks expressed confidence that the balance of the $ 4.5 billion bank facility will be committed within the next several weeks by a syndicate of foreign and domestic banks .
wsj_1467	3	Morgan , Toronto-Dominion and Provident are leading that syndicate .
wsj_1467	4	McCaw is offering to buy 22 million shares of LIN for $ 125 each in cash , which would result in McCaw owning 50.3 % of the cellular-phone and broadcasting concern .
wsj_1467	5	The offer is in limbo , however , because LIN has agreed to merge its cellular-phone businesses with BellSouth Corp .
wsj_1467	6	In national over-the-counter trading Friday , LIN shares rose 62.5 cents to close at $ 110.625 .
wsj_1467	7	Beijing lawmakers have called for jails to be built to house prostitutes and for severe punishment , including the death sentence , for anyone who induces or coerces women into prostitution .
wsj_1467	8	The official Xinhua News Agency said the municipal government was discussing a draft bill to give the capital its first anti-prostitution statutes .
wsj_1467	9	It quoted Liu Changyi , deputy director of the Beijing Public Security Bureau , as saying that there were many more people involved in prostitution now than in 1985 , when there were about 100 cases .
wsj_1467	10	Foreigners involved in prostitution will be punished according to the law , and those with sexually transmitted diseases will be expelled from the country , according to the regulations .
wsj_1467	11	The Communists nearly succeeded in eliminating prostitution after taking over in 1949 , but the practice has returned in recent years with the country 's increased exposure to the outside world .
wsj_1467	12	Japan agreed to enforce a decision by an international wildlife conference to ban all trade in ivory , a spokesman for the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said .
wsj_1467	13	Earlier , Japan had said it might file a reservation against the ivory ban decided by ballot at the 103-nation United Nations Conference on International Trade in Endangered Species in Switzerland last week .
wsj_1467	14	The Japanese use 40 % of the world 's ivory .
wsj_1467	15	Italy should close the Leaning Tower of Pisa because it 's a danger to tourists , government-appointed experts said .
wsj_1467	16	`` In some places the stonework is so damaged it shows signs of breaking off , '' scientists and technicians said in a report to Public Works Minister Giovanni Prandini .
wsj_1467	17	Each year , nearly a million people pay about $ 3 to make the spiral climb up 294 steps to the top of the 800-year-old marble tower .
wsj_1467	18	East Germany pledged to reduce alcohol consumption by boosting production of soft drinks and fruit juices .
wsj_1467	19	Trade and Supply Minister Gerhard Briksa said in a letter published in the youth daily Junge Welt that the rise in alcohol consumption in East Germany had been halted ; but to reduce it further , he said , production and supply of other beverages , including fruit juices , should be stepped up .
wsj_1467	20	He added that shops will have to continue reducing their stocks of liquor and avoid displaying them too prominently in the window .
wsj_1467	21	Hong Kong has built a detention center for illegal immigrants from China because China has refused for the past two weeks to accept them back .
wsj_1467	22	The center , close to Hong Kong 's border with China , will be ready today and will be able to house 1,000 inmates , Police Deputy Director Peter Wong said .
wsj_1467	23	The dispute started when China , angry that Hong Kong had allowed dissident swimmer Yang Yang to flee to the U.S. , halted the usual daily transfer of illegal immigrants caught in this British colony , which reverts to Beijing 's control in 1997 .
wsj_1467	24	Sweating under the glare of newly installed television lights , British members of Parliament demanded a halt to the experimental televising of debates .
wsj_1467	25	A group of senior Conservative legislators , complaining the House of Commons was like a sauna , demanded that the experiment be stopped unless the intensity of the lights is reduced .
wsj_1467	26	One Conservative MP , David Wilshire , said : `` I should have a wonderful suntan by Christmas . ''
wsj_1467	27	Debates are due to be broadcast nationally starting Nov. 21 in a six-month experiment .
wsj_1467	28	A majority of Japanese banks are said to be wary of making new loans to Mexico under the Brady plan because they 're uncertain the Mexican economy will remain stable .
wsj_1467	29	Instead , many small and medium-sized banks , and some larger ones , are likely to take one of the other two options open to them under the plan , Japanese banking officials said .
wsj_1467	30	The plan , proposed by U.S. Secretary of State Nicholas Brady , calls for banks either to make new loans or to reduce the principle on existing loans or to cut the interest rate on those existing loans .
wsj_1467	31	The officials said that most Japanese banks prefer the losses they 'd suffer in either of the latter options to the risk of new lending .
wsj_1467	32	But an official at a long-term credit bank explained that since some larger banks have already taken loss provisions for loans to other Third World nations , further write-offs could be viewed as intolerable .
wsj_1467	33	`` They ca n't take the hit '' to their earnings , he said .
wsj_1467	34	As a result , the official said , they may be forced into a no-win situation in which they make risky loans that they could have to write off later .
wsj_1467	35	A poll in male-dominated South Korea put Margaret Thatcher first on a list of most-respected foreign leaders .
wsj_1467	36	The British prime minister was the only woman singled out by respondents , who put Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev in second place ... .
wsj_1467	37	The Soviet newspaper Trud reported that Mickey Mouse will appear in a Russian-language comic book to be issued four times a year by Soviet publisher Fizkultura i Sport and Denmark 's Gutenberghus Group .
wsj_1467	38	The comic book will cost about $ 2 .
wsj_1468	0	Ekco Group Inc. , Nashua , N.H. , expects to report that net income in the third quarter , ended Oct. 1 , fell 50 % to 60 % from $ 2.1 million , or 11 cents a share , a year earlier .
wsj_1468	1	Robert Stein , president and chief executive officer , attributed the expected decline partly to the effects of a two-week strike last month at the company 's Masillon , Ohio , bakeware facility .
wsj_1468	2	Softer-than-expected orders in early September also played a role , he said in an interview .
wsj_1468	3	But Mr. Stein said he is `` reasonably confident '' that earnings for the full year will exceed the $ 3.1 million , or 17 cents a share , in 1988 .
wsj_1468	4	That would require fourth-quarter net of more than about 22 cents to 24 cents a share , assuming that Mr. Stein 's third-quarter estimate proves accurate .
wsj_1468	5	In the year-earlier fourth quarter , the company had profit of $ 2.7 million , or 15 cents a share .
wsj_1468	6	Third-quarter revenue is expected to be $ 40 million to $ 45 million , up from $ 38.2 million a year earlier , according to Neil Gordon , treasurer .
wsj_1468	7	The year-earlier periods do n't reflect results of the company 's Woodstream Corp. unit , acquired last January , but include some Canadian operations that were sold at the end of 1988 .
wsj_1468	8	August through October traditionally is the busiest season for the bakeware business , as many retailers use the goods as autumn promotional items .
wsj_1468	9	Mr. Stein said some retailers -- perhaps anxious about minimizing inventories -- appear to have held back on orders in September but have been ordering more heavily in October .
wsj_1468	10	Mr. Stein said Woodstream is `` marginally profitable '' but has n't performed as well as expected .
wsj_1468	11	Woodstream 's Victor-brand mousetraps and other pest-control products are `` doing very well , '' and its plastic storage-case products `` are poised for growth , '' he said .
wsj_1468	12	But the unit 's third segment , wildlife traps , is suffering from a `` depressed market , '' and Ekco is seeking to sell that segment , he said .
wsj_1468	13	Mr. Stein said he expects profit to be higher in 1990 than in 1989 , reflecting a number of measures taken since the acquisition of Ekco Housewares in late 1987 .
wsj_1468	14	Prior to acquiring the housewares business , the company was known as Centronics Corp. ; Centronics had been a maker of computer printers , but Mr. Stein and other officers decided to sell that business after Japanese competitors grabbed a dominant share of the market . )
wsj_1468	15	Mr. Stein said tighter operating controls have enabled Ekco to reduce inventory levels 25 % to 30 % ; improve on-time delivery of orders to about 95 % from around 70 % ; and to lower the number of labor hours required to produce a unit .
wsj_1468	16	By moving the design of new products in-house -- instead of contracting out the work -- the company also has been able to come up with designs that can be manufactured more efficiently , he said .
wsj_1468	17	In addition to those measures , the company spent heavily earlier this year to install displays at its customers ' retail outlets -- a strategy that Mr. Stein said has helped bolster awareness of the company 's brands .
wsj_1468	18	Ekco 's housewares operation makes kitchen tools and gadgets , as well as bakeware , at factories in the U.S. and Canada .
wsj_1468	19	The main issue in the strike at the Ohio facility was health-care benefits , Mr. Stein said .
wsj_1468	20	The strike ended Oct .
wsj_1468	21	Ekco continues to seek further acquisitions in the consumer-products industry , Mr. Stein said .
wsj_1468	22	He indicated that Ekco may be interested in acquiring another company with revenue in the range of $ 75 million to $ 100 million , partly because mass merchandisers increasingly want to rely on larger , and fewer , suppliers .
wsj_1469	0	After several years of booming business with China , foreign traders are bracing for the biggest slump in a decade .
wsj_1469	1	The imposition of austerity measures , starting last October , already had begun to pinch when the massacre in Tiananmen Square on June 4 and subsequent events tugged the belt far tighter .
wsj_1469	2	Foreign lending has been virtually suspended since then , choking liquidity and hobbling many projects .
wsj_1469	3	And Beijing has pulled back on domestic loans and subsidies , leaving many domestic buyers and export-oriented plants strapped for cash .
wsj_1469	4	Givaudan Far East Ltd. , a Swiss concern that sells chemicals to shampoo and soap factories in China , typifies the problems .
wsj_1469	5	Last year 's retrenchment dried up the working capital of Chinese factories .
wsj_1469	6	The company 's sales flattened during 1989 's first half .
wsj_1469	7	The June killings magnified the problems .
wsj_1469	8	In Canton , Givaudan 's representative office received no orders in June .
wsj_1469	9	At first it attributed the slump to temporary business disruptions , but when no orders were logged in August and September , manager Donald Lai became convinced that business would be bad for many months .
wsj_1469	10	`` Things have grown worse since June 4 , '' Mr. Lai says .
wsj_1469	11	He predicts that sales will drop between 30 % and 40 % from last year 's $ 3 million .
wsj_1469	12	The consumer-products and light-industrial sectors are bearing the brunt of China 's austerity measures , and foreign companies such as Givaudan that deal with those industries are being hit the hardest .
wsj_1469	13	But in general , all foreign-trading companies are feeling the pinch .
wsj_1469	14	`` The import pie will shrink , '' says John Kamm , first vice president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong and a China trade specialist .
wsj_1469	15	`` On the down side , sales could fall as much as 90 % for some companies ; on the upper side , sales will be flat . ''
wsj_1469	16	China 's foreign trade has gone in cycles during the past decade .
wsj_1469	17	The last time that traders experienced a trough was during 1985-86 , when Beijing imposed tough measures to curb imports and conserve foreign exchange .
wsj_1469	18	The current trough is expected to be much deeper , because Beijing has cut off domestic funds from factories for the first time to slow inflation .
wsj_1469	19	In addition , the suspension of loans and export credits from foreign governments and institutions following the June killings have been a big setback .
wsj_1469	20	`` The freeze on new lending is dealing the single biggest blow to trading , '' says Raymond Wong , China manager for Mannesmann AG , a West German machinery-trading company .
wsj_1469	21	Import growth from the year-earlier months slowed to 16 % in July and 7.1 % in August , compared with an average growth rate of 26 % in the first half .
wsj_1469	22	In the first eight months of 1989 , imports grew 21 % , to $ 38.32 billion , down slightly from a growth rate of 23 % a year earlier .
wsj_1469	23	The picture for China 's exports is just as bleak , mainly because of the domestic credit squeeze .
wsj_1469	24	Exports in the first eight months grew only 9 % , to $ 31.48 billion , compared with a growth rate of 25 % a year earlier , according to Chinese customs figures .
wsj_1469	25	The threat to China 's balance of payments is further aggravated by the plunge in its foreign-exchange reserves , excluding gold holdings .
wsj_1469	26	The reserves dropped for the first time in recent years , to $ 14 billion in June from $ 19 billion in April .
wsj_1469	27	The trend has prompted Beijing to intensify efforts to curb imports .
wsj_1469	28	In recent weeks , China 's leaders have recentralized trading in wool and scores of chemical products and commodities .
wsj_1469	29	The Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade set up a special bureau last month to monitor the issue of import and export licenses .
wsj_1469	30	Beijing 's periodic clampdowns on imports have taught many trading companies that the best way to get through the drought is by helping China export .
wsj_1469	31	For example , Nissho Iwai Corp. , one of the biggest Japanese trading houses , now buys almost twice as many goods from China as it sells to that country .
wsj_1469	32	Three years ago , the ratio was reversed .
wsj_1469	33	But the strategy is n't helping much this time .
wsj_1469	34	`` Both sectors of imports and exports look just as bad , '' says Masahiko Kitamura , general manager of Nissho Iwai 's Canton office .
wsj_1469	35	He expects the company 's trading business to drop as much as 40 % this year .
wsj_1469	36	For a short time after June 4 , it appeared that the trade picture would remain fairly bright .
wsj_1469	37	Many foreign trading offices in Hong Kong were swamped with telexes and telephone calls from Chinese trade officials urging them not to sever ties .
wsj_1469	38	Even the Bank of China , which normally took weeks to process letters of credit , was settling the letters at record speed to dispel rumors about the bank 's financial health .
wsj_1469	39	But when foreign traders tried to do business , they discovered that the eagerness of Chinese trade officials was just a smokescreen .
wsj_1469	40	The suspension of foreign loans has weakened the buying power of China 's national trading companies , which are among the country 's biggest importers .
wsj_1469	41	Business is n't any better on the provincial or municipal level , foreign traders say .
wsj_1469	42	Shanghai Investment & Trust Co. , known as Sitco , is the city 's main financier for trading business .
wsj_1469	43	Sitco had customarily tapped the Japanese bond market for funds , but it ca n't do that any longer .
wsj_1469	44	Foreign traders say the company is strapped for cash .
wsj_1469	45	`` It has difficulties paying its foreign debts , '' says a Hong Kong executive who is familiar with Sitco 's business .
wsj_1469	46	`` How can it make available funds for purchases ? ''
wsj_1469	47	Foreign traders also say many of China 's big infrastructural projects have been canceled or postponed because of the squeeze on domestic and foreign credit .
wsj_1469	48	Albert Lee , a veteran trader who specializes in machinery sales , estimates that as many as 70 % of projects that had obtained approval to proceed have been canceled in recent months .
wsj_1469	49	`` There are virtually no new projects , and that means no new business for us , '' he says .
wsj_1469	50	Even when new lending resumes , foreign exchange would still be tight because Beijing will likely try to rein in foreign borrowing , which has grown between 30 % and 40 % in the past few years .
wsj_1469	51	And foreign creditors are likely to be more cautious about extending new loans because China is nearing a peak repayment period as many loans start falling due in the next two to five years .
wsj_1469	52	Another reason for the intensity of the trade problems is that Beijing has extended the current clampdown on imports beyond the usual target of consumer products to include steel , chemical fertilizers and plastics .
wsj_1469	53	These have been among the country 's leading imports , particularly last year when there were shortages that led many traders to buy heavily and pay dearly .
wsj_1469	54	But the shortages also spawned rampant speculation and spiraling prices .
wsj_1469	55	To stem speculation , Beijing imposed ceiling prices that went into effect earlier this year .
wsj_1469	56	Traders who had bought the goods at prices above the ceiling do n't want to take a loss on resales and are holding onto their stock .
wsj_1469	57	The resulting stockpiling has depressed the market .
wsj_1469	58	But Beijing ca n't cut back on such essential imports as raw materials for too long without hampering the country 's export business .
wsj_1469	59	Mr. Kamm , the China trade expert , estimates that as much as 50 % of Guangdong 's exports is made up of processed imported raw materials .
wsj_1471	0	Chairman Jamie Whitten D. , Miss . of the House Appropriations Committee proposed a $ 2.85 billion emergency funding package to assist California 's recovery from last week 's earthquake and extend further aid to East Coast victims of Hurricane Hugo .
wsj_1471	1	The sweeping measure incorporates $ 500 million in small-business loans , $ 1 billion in highway-construction funds and $ 1.25 billion divided between general emergency assistance and a reserve to be available to President Bush to meet unanticipated costs from the two disasters .
wsj_1471	2	The funds would be attached to a stop-gap spending bill required to keep most of the government operating past Wednesday .
wsj_1471	3	The measure is scheduled to be taken up by the Appropriations Committee today .
wsj_1471	4	The panel is expected to add provisions waiving restrictions on the use of federal highway funds and may also shift money within the package to bolster the share for the Small Business Administration .
wsj_1471	5	`` We will support it , we will thank him , and we will augment it where appropriate , '' said Rep. Vic Fazio D. , Calif . .
wsj_1471	6	Dubbed the `` Dire Emergency Supplemental to Meet the Needs of Natural Disasters of National Significance , '' the measure is vintage Whitten in asserting federal responsibility and in disdaining budget impediments .
wsj_1471	7	`` Such other amounts will be made available subsequently as required , '' the legislation reads , and the new obligations `` shall not be a charge against the Budget Act , Gramm-Rudman-Hollings , or other ceilings .
wsj_1472	0	Moody 's Investors Service Inc. said it lowered the ratings of some $ 145 million of Pinnacle debt because of `` accelerating deficiency in liquidity , '' which it said was evidenced by Pinnacle 's elimination of dividend payments .
wsj_1472	1	Henry Sargent Jr. , Pinnacle executive vice president , said the action `` wo n't really have any effect on us .
wsj_1472	2	We are n't selling bonds right now , and I do n't think it will affect the value of our existing bonds . ''
wsj_1472	3	The rating agency said it lowered the ratings on $ 75 million of the holding company 's convertible subordinated Eurodebentures to B-3 from B-1 .
wsj_1472	4	Moody 's said it also lowered the ratings of $ 70 million of Pinnacle 's MeraBank thrift unit long-term deposits to B-3 from B-2 , and on its subordinated debt to Ca from Caa .
wsj_1472	5	MeraBank 's rating for short-term deposits remains Not Prime .
wsj_1472	6	Securities of MeraBank were placed under review last May , and will remain under review for downgrade , the agency said .
wsj_1475	0	Burmah Oil PLC , a British independent oil and specialty-chemicals marketing concern , said SHV Holdings N.V. has built up a 7.5 % stake in the company .
wsj_1475	1	The holding of 13.6 million shares is up from a 6.7 % stake that Burmah announced SHV held as of last Monday .
wsj_1475	2	SHV , of the Netherlands , which last year merged its North Sea oil and gas operations with those of Calor Group PLC and which owns 40 % of Calor , was identified as a possible suitor for Burmah .
wsj_1475	3	Burmah said it had n't held any discussions with SHV and that `` no deal of any nature is in contemplation .
wsj_1476	0	The top state environmental official in Massachusetts said Clean Harbors Inc. 's environmental-impact statement for a proposed incinerator in Braintree was inadequate .
wsj_1476	1	The official , John DeVillars , asked Clean Harbors for more information before ruling on a permit for the site .
wsj_1476	2	Critics of the plan , including the town of Braintree , say the incinerator is a health hazard .
wsj_1476	3	Clean Harbors , based in Quincy , said it `` will proceed expeditiously '' to submit the data requested .
wsj_1476	4	Alan McKim , chief executive officer of Clean Harbors said he was `` very much encouraged '' by the official 's praise of Clean Harbors for the quality of some of the data in the report .

wsj_1477	3	Citizens , based in Atlanta , said it has about $ 4.6 billion in factored sales annually ; the Security Pacific unit has about $ 1.8 billion annually .
wsj_1477	4	Security Pacific 's factoring business works with companies in the apparel , textile and food industries , among others .
wsj_1478	0	The Office of Thrift Supervision banned B.J. Garman , a former director of the failed Vision Banc Savings Association of Kingsville , Texas , from working in any financial institution insured by the government .
wsj_1478	1	The office , a Treasury Department unit that is the successor to the Federal Home Loan Bank Board , said this was the first announcement of an enforcement action since this year 's thrift-bailout legislation ordered that all such actions by federal banking regulators be made public .
wsj_1478	2	Generally , regulators have n't announced enforcement actions in the past .
wsj_1478	3	Indeed , the OTS said that before the law took effect Aug. 9 , it banned another `` key Vision Banc insider '' from insured financial institutions .
wsj_1478	4	That individual was n't identified .
wsj_1478	5	Vision Banc was placed in government conservatorship in March , and it operates under the control of the Resolution Trust Corp. , the agency created to sell or liquidate insolvent thrifts .
wsj_1478	6	The OTS did n't say specifically why the action was taken against Ms. Garman .
wsj_1478	7	However , it said examiners found a variety of insider dealings at the thrift , including `` extraordinary loan commissions '' paid to a firm associated with Vision Banc officials , and loans diverted through borrowers back to the thrift officials .
wsj_1478	8	Ms. Garman could n't be reached for comment .

wsj_1491	3	The Weston , Mass. , utilities and marine-transport concern said results for the third quarter , usually a money-losing one because of the seasonality of the gas business , were also aided by higher gas sales and the May 1989 acquisition of Water Products Company .

wsj_1492	7	Earlier this month , Convex made a bid to outflank other supercomputer competitors like Digital Equipment Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. by adopting an open set of standards and introducing new hardware and software to link different systems .
wsj_1492	8	The new products allow customers to add Convex machines to established systems made by other manufacturers , which `` opens up a phenomenal market for us , '' said Robert J. Paluck , Convex 's chairman , president and chief executive .

wsj_1493	0	Troubled Saatchi & Saatchi Co. has attracted offers for some of its advertising units , with potential suitors including Interpublic Group , but has rejected them , people familiar with the company said .
wsj_1493	1	Industry executives said Interpublic approached Saatchi in August about buying its Campbell-Mithun-Esty unit , but was turned down by Chairman Maurice Saatchi .
wsj_1493	2	More recently , Interpublic inquired about one of Saatchi 's smaller communications companies -- identified as the Rowland public relations firm by several industry executives -- but again was rebuffed , they said .
wsj_1493	3	Interpublic 's chairman and chief executive officer , Philip Geier Jr. , made the pitches in visits to Mr. Saatchi in London , the executives said .
wsj_1493	4	A Saatchi spokesman declined to comment about Interpublic .
wsj_1493	5	But the spokesman confirmed that Saatchi has received several inquiries from companies interested in acquiring its Campbell-Mithun and Rowland units .
wsj_1493	6	He added , `` We have no intention of selling either business . ''
wsj_1493	7	The offers come as Saatchi is struggling through the most troubled period in its 19-year history .
wsj_1493	8	Takeover speculation has been rife , its consulting business is on the block , and its largest shareholder , Southeastern Asset Management , has said it 's been approached by third parties regarding a possible restructuring .
wsj_1493	9	Analysts have continually lowered their earnings estimates for the company , and their outlook , at least for the short term , is bleak .
wsj_1493	10	In the midst of the current turmoil , Saatchi is attempting to shore up its ad businesses .
wsj_1493	11	It named a new chief executive officer , former IMS International head Robert Louis-Dreyfus .
wsj_1493	12	It rebuffed an offer by Carl Spielvogel , head of Saatchi 's Backer Spielvogel Bates unit , to lead a management buy-out of all or part of Saatchi .
wsj_1493	13	And last week , people close to Saatchi said Maurice Saatchi and his brother , Charles , would lead a buy-out if a hostile bid emerged .
wsj_1493	14	But Saatchi 's troubles have only whipped up interest among outsiders interested in picking off pieces of its ad businesses .
wsj_1493	15	While Saatchi 's major agency networks -- Backer Spielvogel and Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising -- would be difficult for any ad firm to buy because of potential client conflicts , its smaller businesses are quite attractive .
wsj_1493	16	Campbell-Mithun-Esty , for example , has had big problems at its New York office , but offers strong offices in other areas of the country , including Minneapolis and Chicago .
wsj_1493	17	That would would make it appealing to a network such as Interpublic that already has a healthy New York presence .
wsj_1493	18	While there would be some client conflicts , they would n't be nearly as onerous as with Saatchi 's other agencies . )
wsj_1493	19	Campbell-Mithun also would be a sizable addition to an agency network : It has billings of about $ 850 million and blue-chip clients including General Mills , Jeep/Eagle and Dow Brands .
wsj_1493	20	Rowland , meanwhile , has expanded aggressively , and now ranks as the fifth-largest U.S. public relations firm , according to O'Dwyer's Directory of Public Relations Firms .
wsj_1493	21	It would be attractive to an agency such as Interpublic , one of the few big agency groups without an affiliated public relations firm of its own .
wsj_1493	22	Other Saatchi units include ad agency McCaffrey & McCall , which has the Mercedes account and which has been attempting to buy itself back ; and Howard Marlboro , a sports and event marketing firm .
wsj_1493	23	Despite Saatchi 's firm stand against selling its ad units , U.S. analysts believe the company may ultimately sell some of the smaller units .
wsj_1493	24	Mr. Louis-Dreyfus , in a recent interview , said he might sell `` a marginal agency or office . ''
wsj_1493	25	Analysts believe he may ultimately dispose of some of the non-advertising businesses .
wsj_1493	26	Prudential Insurance Co. of America said it selected four agencies to pitch its $ 60 million to $ 70 million account .
wsj_1493	27	In addition to Backer Spielvogel Bates , a Saatchi unit that has handled the account since 1970 , the other agencies include Lowe Marschalk , a unit of the Lowe Group ; Grey Advertising ; and WPP Group 's Scali , McCabe , Sloves agency .
wsj_1493	28	All agencies are New York-based .
wsj_1493	29	A spokesman for the insurance and financial services firm , based in Newark , N.J. , said it hopes to make a decision within three to four months .
wsj_1493	30	The Jamaica Tourist Board , in the wake of Young & Rubicam 's indictment on charges that it bribed Jamaican officials to win the account in 1981 , released a scathing memo blaming the agency for the embarrassing incident .
wsj_1493	31	The memo attempts to remove the tourist board as far as possible from the agency , which pleaded innocent to the charges .
wsj_1493	32	Among other things , the memo contends that Young & Rubicam gave false assurances that the investigation would n't uncover any information that would `` embarrass the government of Jamaica or the Jamaica Tourist Board . ''
wsj_1493	33	It also contends that Young & Rubicam never told the tourist board about its relationship with Ad Ventures , a Jamaican firm hired by the agency .
wsj_1493	34	The U.S. indictment charges Ad Ventures was a front used to funnel kickbacks to the then-minister of tourism .
wsj_1493	35	The memo also chastises the agency for the timing of its announcement Thursday that it would no longer handle the $ 5 million to $ 6 million account .
wsj_1493	36	The agency declined comment , but said it will continue work until a new agency is chosen .
wsj_1493	37	: American Suzuki Motor Corp. , Brea , Calif. , awarded its estimated $ 10 million to $ 30 million account to Asher/Gould , Los Angeles .
wsj_1493	38	Also participating in the finals was Los Angeles agency Hakuhodo Advertising America .
wsj_1493	39	American Suzuki 's previous agency , Keye/Donna/Pearlstein , did n't participate .
wsj_1493	40	N W Ayer 's president and chief executive officer , Jerry J. Siano , said the agency is holding `` conversations '' about acquiring Zwiren Collins Karo & Trusk , a midsized Chicago agency , but a deal is n't yet close to being completed .

wsj_1505	7	With investors relieved at the overnight gain in New York stocks , small-lot buying orders streamed into the market from early morning , making traders believe the market was back to normal .
wsj_1505	8	The Nikkei , which reached as high as 35611.38 right after the opening , surrendered part of its early advance toward the end of the day because of profit-taking .
wsj_1505	9	`` Investors , especially dealers , do n't want to hold a position over the weekend , '' a trader at Dai-ichi Securities said , adding , though , that the trading mood remained positive through the afternoon session .

wsj_1505	14	But the Nikkei fell an overall 1.8 % in value that day compared with Wall Street 's far sharper 6.9 % drop on Oct. 13 .
wsj_1505	15	The Tokyo market 's resiliency helped participants to regain confidence gradually as they spent more time on analyzing factors that caused the Friday plunge and realized these problems were unique to New York stocks and not directly related to Tokyo .

wsj_1505	33	London was weak throughout Friday 's trading , however , on what dealers attributed to generally thin interest ahead of the weekend and this week 's potentially important U.K. trade figures for September .
wsj_1505	34	The FT-SE 100 largely remained within an 11-point range establshed within the first hour of trading before it eased to an intraday low late in the session when a flurry of program selling pushed Wall Street lower .

wsj_1505	36	Volume was extremely thin at 351.3 million shares , the lightest volume of the week and modestly under Thursday 's 387.4 million shares .
wsj_1505	37	Dealers said the day 's action was featureless outside some response to sterling 's early weakness against the mark , and fears that Wall Street might open lower after its strong leap forward Thursday .
wsj_1505	38	They added that market-makers were largely sidelined after aggressively supporting the market Thursday in their quest to cover internal shortages of FT-SE 100 shares .
wsj_1505	39	Interest may remain limited into tomorrow 's U.K. trade figures , which the market will be watching closely to see if there is any improvement after disappointing numbers in the previous two months .

wsj_1505	47	Sir James said Thursday night that his plans for the takeover had n't changed .
wsj_1505	48	B.A.T ended the day at 778 , down 5 , on turnover of 7.5 million shares .
wsj_1505	49	Dealers said it was hit by some profit-taking after gains since mid-week .

wsj_1507	1	MUTUAL FUNDS ARRIVED IN THE U.S. during the Roaring Twenties they had been in Britain for a century , but they did n't boom until the money market fund was created in the 1970s .
wsj_1507	2	By 1980 , there were more than 100 such funds .
wsj_1507	3	Besides creating a vehicle for investors , money market funds also helped rewrite banking regulations .
wsj_1507	4	The idea was to let small investors , the backbone of the fund business , deal in the money market 's high short-term interest rates .
wsj_1507	5	This had been the exclusive province of those rich enough to use six-figure sums to get income that was figured beyond the third or fourth decimal place .
wsj_1507	6	The now-standard price of $ 1 a share came about by accident .
wsj_1507	7	An early fund had filed a registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission that included a fixed $ 1 price .
wsj_1507	8	It arrived just as the regulator handling such operations was retiring .
wsj_1507	9	His successor approved the $ 1 price in the process of clearing the backed-up papers on his desk .
wsj_1507	10	When Dreyfus started the first advertising-backed retail fund in February 1974 , it was priced at $ 10 a share and reached $ 1 billion in assets in one year . )
wsj_1507	11	Dreyfus moved to the $ 1 price after the SEC set standards -- an average 120-day maturity of high-grade paper -- that are still the rule .
wsj_1507	12	Keeping the listed price at a dollar is primarily a convenience .
wsj_1507	13	Actually , the funds do fluctuate , but beyond the third decimal place .
wsj_1507	14	Rounding-off keeps them at $ 1 .
wsj_1507	15	Eventually , the money funds ' success forced relaxation of curbs on bank interest rates to allow banks to offer competing yields .
wsj_1507	16	The new instrument also introduced many to the industry -- 30 % of fund owners there are more than 54 million accounts started with a money fund .

wsj_1509	2	But agreement aparently could n't be reached because of opposition from the states of Hamburg and Bremen , which are demanding more influence over the German Airbus operations and a better guarantee against job losses in the troubled Northern German region .
wsj_1509	3	The two states and the state of Bavaria still hold a majority in MBB , but their stake will fall to around 30 % after Daimler-Benz acquires its stake in the concern .

wsj_1514	1	I.E.P. Securities Ltd. , a unit of Mr. Brierley 's Hong Kong-based Industrial Equity Pacific Ltd. , boosted its holdings in Vickers to 38.8 million shares .

wsj_1515	0	When Rune Andersson set out to revive flagging Swedish conglomerate Trelleborg AB in the early 1980s , he spurned the advice of trendy management consultants .
wsj_1515	1	`` All these consultants kept coming around telling us we should concentrate on high technology , electronics or biotechnology , and get out of mature basic industries , '' Mr. Andersson recalls .
wsj_1515	2	Yet under its 45-year-old president , Trelleborg moved aggressively into those unfashionable base industries -- first strengthening its existing rubber and plastics division , later adding mining as well as building and construction materials .
wsj_1515	3	It was a gutsy move for a little-known executive , fired after only two months as president of his previous company .
wsj_1515	4	But going against the grain has never bothered Mr. Andersson .
wsj_1515	5	Stroking his trademark white goatee during a recent interview , the diminutive Swede quips : `` It turned out to be lucky for us .
wsj_1515	6	If the whole market thinks what you 're doing is crazy you do n't have much competition . ''
wsj_1515	7	Mr. Andersson is anxious to strengthen Trelleborg 's balance sheet .
wsj_1515	8	Characteristically , he did n't waste much time getting started .
wsj_1515	9	On Tuesday , Trelleborg 's directors announced plans to spin off two big divisions -- minerals processing , and building and distribution -- as separately quoted companies on Stockholm 's Stock Exchange .
wsj_1515	10	At current market prices , the twin public offerings to be completed next year would add an estimated 2.5 billion Swedish kronor $ 386 million to Trelleborg 's coffers , analysts say .
wsj_1515	11	The board had also been expected to approve a SKr1.5 billion international offering of new Trelleborg shares .
wsj_1515	12	But that share issue -- intended to make Trelleborg better known among international investors -- was postponed until market conditions stabilize , people familiar with the situation say .
wsj_1515	13	Trelleborg 's internationally traded `` Bfree '' series stock plunged SKr29 $ 4.48 to SKr205 $ 31.65 in volatile trading Monday in Stockholm .
wsj_1515	14	Tuesday , the shares regained SKr20 , closing at SKr225 .
wsj_1515	15	Mr. Andersson says he is confident that taking parts of the company public will help erase the `` conglomerate stigma '' that has held down Trelleborg 's share price .
wsj_1515	16	Trelleborg plans to remain the dominant shareholder with stakes of slightly less than 50 % of both units .
wsj_1515	17	The spinoff should solve a problem for the parent .
wsj_1515	18	A family foundation set up by late founder Henry Dunker controls 59 % of Trelleborg 's voting shares outstanding .
wsj_1515	19	But the foundation bylaws require the entire Trelleborg stake to be sold in the open market if control drops below 50 % .
wsj_1515	20	That possibility had crept closer as repeated new share offerings to finance Trelleborg 's rapid growth steadily diluted the foundation 's holding .
wsj_1515	21	That growth is the result of Mr. Andersson 's shopping spree , during which he has bought and sold more than 100 companies during the past five years .
wsj_1515	22	Most of the new additions were barely profitable , if not outright loss makers .
wsj_1515	23	Applying prowess gained during earlier stints at appliance maker AB Electrolux , Mr. Andersson and a handful of loyal lieutenants aggressively stripped away dead wood -- and got quick results .
wsj_1515	24	The treatment turned Trelleborg into one of Scandinavia 's biggest and fastest-growing industrial concerns .
wsj_1515	25	Between 1985 and 1988 , sales multipled more than 10 times and pretax profit surged almost twelvefold .
wsj_1515	26	Many analysts expect Mr. Andersson , who owns 1.7 % of the company , to be named Trelleborg 's new chairman when Ernst Herslow steps down next year .
wsj_1515	27	But the promotion is n't likely to alter a management style Mr. Andersson describes as `` being the driving force leading the troops , not managing by sitting back with a cigar waiting for people to bring me ideas . ''
wsj_1515	28	Last month , in his boldest move yet , Mr. Andersson and Trelleborg joined forces with Canada 's Noranda Inc. in a joint $ 2 billion hostile takeover of another big Canadian mining concern , Falconbridge Ltd .
wsj_1515	29	Industry analysts suggest that the conquest of Falconbridge could vault Trelleborg from a regional Scandinavian success story to a world-class mining concern .
wsj_1515	30	`` Trelleborg is n't in the same league yet as mining giants such as RTZ Corp. or Anglo-American Corp. , '' says Mike Kurtanjek , a mining analyst at James Capel & Co. , London .
wsj_1515	31	`` But we certainly like what we 've seen so far . ''
wsj_1515	32	But Trelleborg still must clear some tough hurdles .
wsj_1515	33	Mr. Andersson acknowledges that the company 's mining division `` will be busy for a while digesting its recent expansion . ''
wsj_1515	34	Booming metals prices have fueled Trelleborg 's recent profit surge , raising mining 's share of pretax profit to 68 % this year from a big loss two years earlier .
wsj_1515	35	But analysts caution an expected fall in metal prices next year could slow profit growth .
wsj_1515	36	Mining is likely to remain Trelleborg 's main business .
wsj_1515	37	Analysts say its chances of success will likely hinge on how well Trelleborg manages to cooperate with Noranda in the Falconbridge venture .
wsj_1515	38	Noranda and Trelleborg each came close to winning Falconbridge alone before the successful joint bid .
wsj_1515	39	Some analysts say Noranda would prefer to break up Falconbridge , and that the Swedes -- relatively inexperienced in international mining operations -- could have problems holding their own with a much bigger partner like Noranda operating on its home turf .
wsj_1515	40	Mr. Andersson insists that Trelleborg and Noranda have n't discussed a Falconbridge break-up .
wsj_1515	41	Falconbridge , he says , will continue operating in its current form .
wsj_1515	42	`` We 'd be reluctant to accept 50-50 ownership in a manufacturing company .
wsj_1515	43	But such partnerships are common in mining , where there are n't problems or conflict of interest or risk of cheating by a partner , '' Trelleborg 's president says .
wsj_1515	44	Perhaps more important , both companies share Mr. Andersson 's belief in the coming renaissance of base industries .
wsj_1515	45	`` If the 1980s were a decade of consumption , the '90s will be the investment decade , '' Mr. Andersson says .
wsj_1515	46	`` The whole of Europe and the industrialized world is suffering from a breakdown in infrastructure investment , '' he says .
wsj_1515	47	`` That 's beginning to change .
wsj_1515	48	And investment is the key word for base metals , and most other businesses Trelleborg is in .

wsj_1516	9	Mr. Sculley also indicated that sagging margins , which dogged the company through most of 1989 , began to turn up in the fourth quarter as chip prices eased .
wsj_1516	10	`` Adverse pressure on gross margins ... has subsided , '' Mr. Sculley said .

wsj_1529	0	Guillermo Ortiz 's Sept. 15 Americas column , `` Mexico 's Been Bitten by the Privatization Bug , '' is a refreshingly clear statement of his government 's commitment to privatization , and must be welcomed as such by all Americans who wish his country well .
wsj_1529	1	The Mexico-United States Institute is glad to see such a high official as Mexico 's undersecretary of finance view his country 's reforms `` in the context of a larger , world-wide process '' of profound change toward free-market economics , especially in the statist countries .
wsj_1529	2	Having said that , we must caution against an apparent tendency to overstate the case .
wsj_1529	3	It is not quite true , for example , that the Mexican government has `` privatized '' Mexicana de Aviacion , as Mr. Ortiz claims .
wsj_1529	4	In the same sentence he contradicts himself when he reports that the government still retains 40 % of the total equity of the airline .
wsj_1529	5	How can a company be considered `` privatized '' if the state is so heavily represented in it ?
wsj_1529	6	True , the Mexican government has granted `` control '' over the airline to a new private consortium , but its propensity to take back what it gives is too well known to permit one to be sanguine . )
wsj_1529	7	Regrettably , too , Mr. Ortiz resorts to the familiar `` numbers game '' when he boasts that `` fewer than 392 state enterprises ) currently remain in the public sector , '' down from the `` 1,155 public entities that existed in 1982 .
wsj_1529	8	'' But the enterprises still in state hands include the biggest and most economically powerful ones in Mexico ; indeed , they virtually constitute the economic infrastructure .
wsj_1529	9	I refer essentially to petroleum , electric power , banking and newsprint .
wsj_1529	10	Those enterprises , however , are not going to be privatized .
wsj_1529	11	They are officially considered `` strategic , '' and their privatization is prohibited by the Mexican Constitution .
wsj_1529	12	In language that sidesteps the issue , Mr. Ortiz writes , `` The divestiture of nonpriority and nonstrategic public enterprises is an essential element of President Carlos Salinas 's plan to modernize Mexico 's economy ... . ''
wsj_1529	13	Yet clearly , modernization must embrace its key industries before it can be said to have caught the `` privatization bug . ''
wsj_1529	14	The bottom line , however , is not economic but political reform .
wsj_1529	15	A long succession of Mexican presidents arbitrarily nationalized whatever industry they took a fancy to , without having to answer to the public .
wsj_1529	16	To guarantee that Mexicana de Aviacion and other companies will really be privatized , Mexico needs a pluri-party political system that will ensure democracy and hence accountability .

wsj_1531	0	A labor-management group is preparing a revised buy-out bid for United Airlines parent UAL Corp. that would transfer majority ownership to employees while leaving some stock in public hands , according to people familiar with the group .
wsj_1531	1	The group has been discussing a proposal valued in a range of $ 225 to $ 240 a share , or $ 5.09 billion to $ 5.42 billion .
wsj_1531	2	But to avoid the risk of rejection , the group does n't plan to submit the plan formally at a UAL board meeting today .
wsj_1531	3	Instead , the group is raising the proposal informally to try to test the board 's reaction .
wsj_1531	4	People familiar with the company say the board is n't likely to give quick approval to any offer substantially below the $ 300-a-share , $ 6.79 billion buy-out bid that collapsed last week after banks would n't raise needed loans and after a key partner , British Airways PLC , dropped out .
wsj_1531	5	In composite trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange , UAL closed at $ 168.50 a share , down $ 21.625 .
wsj_1531	6	But the pilots union , which has been pushing for a takeover since 1987 , appears to be pressing ahead with the revised bid to avoid further loss of momentum even though it has n't found a partner to replace British Air .
wsj_1531	7	Although the bidding group has n't had time to develop its latest idea fully or to discuss it with banks , it believes bank financing could be obtained .
wsj_1531	8	After the collapse of the last effort , the group does n't plan to make any formal proposal without binding commitments from banks covering the entire amount to be borrowed .
wsj_1531	9	Under the type of transaction being discussed , the pilot-management group would borrow several billion dollars from banks that could then be used to finance a cash payment to current holders .
wsj_1531	10	Those current holders would also receive minority interests in the new company .
wsj_1531	11	For example , the group could offer $ 200 a share in cash plus stock valued at $ 30 a share .
wsj_1531	12	UAL currently has 22.6 million shares , fully diluted .
wsj_1531	13	The new structure would be similar to a recapitalization in which holders get a special dividend yet retain a controlling ownership interest .
wsj_1531	14	The difference is that current holders would n't retain majority ownership or control .
wsj_1531	15	The failed takeover would have given UAL employees 75 % voting control of the nation 's second-largest airline , with management getting 10 % control and British Air 15 % .
wsj_1531	16	It was n't clear how the ownership would stack up under the new plan , but employees would keep more than 50 % .
wsj_1531	17	Management 's total could be reduced , and the public could get more than the 15 % control that had been earmarked for British Air .
wsj_1531	18	One option the board is likely to consider today is some sort of cooling-off period .
wsj_1531	19	Although the pilots are expected to continue to pursue the bid , UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf may be asked to withdraw from the buy-out effort , at least temporarily , and to return to running the company full time .
wsj_1531	20	The board could eventually come under some pressure to sell the company because its members can be ousted by a majority shareholder vote , particularly since one-third of UAL stock is held by takeover stock speculators who favor a sale .
wsj_1531	21	The labor-management buy-out group plans to keep its offer on the table in an apparent attempt to maintain its bargaining position with the board .
wsj_1531	22	However , the only outsider who has emerged to lead such a shareholder vote , Los Angeles investor Marvin Davis , who triggered the buy-out with a $ 5.4 billion bid in early August , is hanging back -- apparently to avoid being blamed for contributing to the deal 's collapse .
wsj_1531	23	Three top advisers to Mr. Davis visited New York late last week , at least in part to confer with executives at Citicorp .
wsj_1531	24	Mr. Davis had paid $ 6 million for Citicorp 's backing of his last bid .
wsj_1531	25	But Citicorp has lost some credibility because it also led the unsuccessful effort to gain bank loans for the labor-management group .
wsj_1531	26	On Friday , British Air issued a statement saying it `` does not intend to participate in any new deal for the acquisition of UAL in the foreseeable future . ''
wsj_1531	27	However , several people said that British Air might yet rejoin the bidding group and that the carrier made the statement to answer questions from British regulators about how it plans to use proceeds of a securities offering previously earmarked for the UAL buy-out .
wsj_1531	28	Also late last week , UAL flight attendants agreed to participate with the pilots in crafting a revised offer .
wsj_1531	29	But the machinists union , whose opposition helped scuttle the first buy-out bid , is likely to favor a recapitalization with a friendly third-party investor .
wsj_1531	30	One advantage the buy-out group intends to press with the board is that pilots have agreed to make $ 200 million in annual cost concessions to help finance a bid .
wsj_1531	31	Speculation has also arisen that the UAL executive most closely identified with the failure to gain bank financing , chief financial officer John Pope , may come under pressure to resign .
wsj_1531	32	However , people familiar with the buy-out group said Mr. Pope 's departure would weaken the airline 's management at a critical time .
wsj_1531	33	Despite the buy-out group 's failure to obtain financing , UAL remains obligated to pay $ 26.7 million in investment banking and legal fees to the group 's advisers , Lazard Freres & Co. , Salomon Brothers Inc. , and Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison .

wsj_1551	0	Dow Jones & Co. announced Wall Street Journal advertising rates for 1990 .
wsj_1551	1	The rates , which take effect Jan. 2 , include a 4 % increase for national edition advertising .
wsj_1551	2	The Journal also will offer expanded volume and frequency discounts .
wsj_1551	3	The increase for national edition advertising is less than the inflation rate and compares with a 6.5 % increase in 1989 .
wsj_1551	4	`` Newsprint and postage prices this year have not gone up , '' said Peter R. Kann , president of Dow Jones .
wsj_1551	5	`` We have invested in improved editorial quality and expanded our quality audience without substantially increasing our costs .

wsj_1552	0	Reflecting the impact of lower semiconductor prices and cuts in defense spending , Texas Instruments Inc. said third-quarter net income fell 31 % and sales dropped slightly from a year earlier .
wsj_1552	1	Net fell to $ 65 million , or 67 cents a common share , from $ 93.7 million or $ 1.03 a share , a year ago .
wsj_1552	2	Sales fell 2.5 % to $ 1.54 billion from $ 1.58 billion .
wsj_1552	3	For the nine months , the electronics and defense concern had net of $ 255.8 million , or $ 2.70 a share , down 5.6 % from $ 271 million , or $ 3.01 a share , in the year-ago period .
wsj_1552	4	Sales were $ 4.66 billion , up 1.3 % from $ 4.6 billion .
wsj_1552	5	Jerry Junkins , chairman , president and chief executive officer , said sluggish consumer-electronics sales reduced demand for semiconductors .
wsj_1552	6	That , coupled with lower semiconductor prices and higher semiconductor-depreciation expense , contributed to the decline in sales and profit .
wsj_1552	7	In addition , cost increases related to fixed-price defense contracts and a $ 10 million charge to reduce the work force of Texas Instruments ' defense-electronics division also reduced net .
wsj_1552	8	However , the quarter results included $ 28 million in royalty income from patent licenses , up from $ 21 million in the year-earlier period .
wsj_1552	9	The nine months include $ 125 million of royalty income , up from $ 98 million last year .
wsj_1552	10	Mr. Junkins was n't optimistic about the short-term outlook , hinting that further workforce reductions may be needed .
wsj_1552	11	`` We expect near-term sluggishness in the electronics market , '' he said , `` and we will take ongoing cost-reduction actions as necessary to keep operations aligned with demand . ''
wsj_1552	12	Further , he said , an internal reorganization to combine several divisions into the Information Technology Group is expected to affect fourth-quarter results by an undisclosed amount .
wsj_1553	0	Lynch Corp. said its Lynch Telephone Corp. subsidiary completed the acquisition of Western New Mexico Telephone Co. for $ 20 million plus assumption of $ 24 million of debt .
wsj_1553	1	Western New Mexico Telephone , Silver City , had net income of $ 1.9 million on revenue of about $ 10 million last year .
wsj_1553	2	It is an independent phone company with a service area of 15,000 square miles in southwest New Mexico .
wsj_1553	3	It is also a partner in the wireline cellular franchise covering most of western New Mexico .
wsj_1553	4	The transaction represents Lynch 's entry into the telephone business .
wsj_1553	5	The company , which has interests in television , trucking services , and glass-making and food-processing equipment , said it plans to make other acquisitions in the telephone industry .
wsj_1555	0	Hewlett-Packard Co. will announce today a software program that allows computers in a network to speed up computing tasks by sending the tasks to each other .
wsj_1555	1	Called Task Broker , the program acts something like an auctioneer among a group of computers wired together .
wsj_1555	2	If a machine has a big computing task , Task Broker asks other computers in the network for `` bids '' on the job .
wsj_1555	3	It then determines which machine is free to do the task most quickly and sends the task to that machine .
wsj_1555	4	Hewlett-Packard claims that the software allows a network to run three times as many tasks as conventional networks and will run each task twice as fast .
wsj_1555	5	The new Hewlett-Packard program , said analyst John McCarthy at Forrester Research Inc. , a computer-market research company , `` is a key building block as people move to this new model of distributed processing . ''
wsj_1555	6	In today 's computer networks , some machines often sit idle while others are overtaxed .
wsj_1555	7	With the Hewlett-Packard program , he said , `` You get more bang for the buck you 've spent on computers . ''
wsj_1555	8	The program , which will be shipped in January 1990 , runs on the Unix operating system .
wsj_1555	9	Hewlett-Packard will charge $ 5,000 for a license covering 10 users .
wsj_1555	10	The program now works on all Hewlett-Packard and Apollo workstations and on computers made by Multiflow Computer Inc. of Branford , Conn .
wsj_1555	11	Hewlett-Packard said it will sell versions later next year that run on Sun Microsystems Inc. and Digital Equipment Corp. machines .
wsj_1555	12	The Task Broker differs from other programs that spread computing tasks around a network .
wsj_1555	13	A previously available program called Network Computing System , developed by Hewlett-Packard 's Apollo division , for instance , takes a task and splits it up into parts , divvying up those parts to several computers in a network for simultaneous processing .
wsj_1555	14	But programs in individual computers must be revised in order to work with that system .
wsj_1555	15	Applications wo n't have to be rewritten to work with Task Broker , Hewlett-Packard said , and the user of a computer wo n't be able to tell that another machine is doing the work .
wsj_1555	16	The Task Broker `` turns that network into -- as far as the user is concerned -- one giant computer , '' said Bill Kay , general manager of Hewlett-Packard 's workstation group .
wsj_1556	0	Price wars between the fast-food giants are starting to clobber the fast-food little guys : the franchisees .
wsj_1556	1	`` When elephants start fighting , ants get killed , '' says Murray Riese , co-owner of National Restaurants , a New York franchisee for Pizza Hut , Roy Rogers and other chains .
wsj_1556	2	As hamburger and pizza outlets saturate one area after another , franchisers are struggling desperately for market share , slashing prices and stepping up costly promotions .
wsj_1556	3	The fight is putting a tight squeeze on profits of many , threatening to drive the smallest ones out of business and straining relations between the national fast-food chains and their franchisees .
wsj_1556	4	The chains `` used to offer discounts during winter when business was slow , but in the last year or so , discounting has become a 12-month thing , '' says Donald Harty , president of Charisma Group Inc. , a New York franchisee of Grand Metropolitan PLC 's Burger King chain .
wsj_1556	5	Though Charisma 's sales are up slightly this year , Mr. Harty says profits will be flat or lower .
wsj_1556	6	And Bill Konopnicki , a Safford , Ariz. , licensee of McDonald 's Corp. who is chairman of the company 's National Operators Advisory Board , says some fast-food outlets `` could be in serious trouble , based on the amount of discounting that seems to be going on . ''
wsj_1556	7	Until recently , the huge fast-food industry , with sales of about $ 60.1 billion last year , kept price-skirmishing to a minimum .
wsj_1556	8	But early this year , PepsiCo Inc. 's Taco Bell unit and Wendy 's International Inc. slashed prices and stepped up promotions , says John Rohs , an analyst for Wertheim Schroder & Co .
wsj_1556	9	That brought a chain reaction in the industry .
wsj_1556	10	The situation was further aggravated early this month , when McDonald 's set plans to heat up the discounting by offering coupons .
wsj_1556	11	It also decided to go national with pizza , which it has been test-marketing .
wsj_1556	12	Now , two-for-one deals on pizza are common ; so are 99-cent specials on sandwiches normally priced twice as high .
wsj_1556	13	The discounting , say fast-food operators , occurs on a scale and with a frequency they have n't seen before .
wsj_1556	14	The result is that some franchisees are running hard just to stay even , laying off middle managers and working harder to make less .
wsj_1556	15	Joe Mack , a district manager for Cormack Enterprises Inc. , a Burger King operator in Omaha , Neb. , says discounting is so prevalent that `` we have to serve 15 % to 20 % more customers '' to keep sales level .
wsj_1556	16	`` It 's almost as if you 're doing extra work to give away the food , '' he says .
wsj_1556	17	Alan D'Agosto , president of Panda 's Inc. , an operator of Arby 's restaurants in Omaha , says : `` All we 're doing is keeping the customers coming , but we are n't increasing sales . ''
wsj_1556	18	With fast-food outlets on every corner , he , like many , does n't think he has a choice in the price war : `` Our customers say that they wo n't go into a fast-food store unless they get a coupon . ''
wsj_1556	19	If the battle continues much longer , many fast-food businesses will close or merge , predicts Vincent Morrissey , who owns a string of Kentucky Fried Chicken stores in the Midwest .
wsj_1556	20	`` The industry is overbuilt , '' he says .
wsj_1556	21	`` Fast-food franchisers have managed to squeeze in stores into every corner available . ''
wsj_1556	22	The National Restaurant Association says quick-service restaurant units in the U.S. rose 14 % to 131,146 between 1983 and 1987 , the last year for which figures are available .
wsj_1556	23	With the market so crowded , says a spokesman for Wendy 's in Columbus , Ohio , `` If you 're doing well , you 're doing well at someone else 's expense . ''
wsj_1556	24	Simply put , there is n't enough business for every store to grow .
wsj_1556	25	According to Mr. Rohs , inflation-adjusted , same-store sales at company-owned Wendy 's units in the U.S. have trailed year-earlier levels throughout 1989 , except for August .
wsj_1556	26	`` McDonald 's has also been running negative all year , '' the analyst says .
wsj_1556	27	Spokesmen for Wendy 's and McDonald 's criticized Mr. Rohs 's calculations .
wsj_1556	28	Jack Greenberg , executive vice president and chief financial officer of McDonald 's , says the company does n't compute , much less disclose , inflation-adjusted , same-store sales .
wsj_1556	29	He adds that short-term comparisons `` can be very misleading because of differences in timing of marketing programs from year to year . ''
wsj_1556	30	Profit margins at company-owned McDonald 's outlets in the U.S. `` are holding up quite nicely , '' says Mr. Greenberg .
wsj_1556	31	Profits of franchisees have n't been higher since the mid-1970s , he adds .
wsj_1556	32	But Mr. Greenberg 's sanguine outlook is n't matched by many fast-food industry observers .
wsj_1556	33	Smaller chains and single-store operators will be the first to fail , many in the industry predict .
wsj_1556	34	Big franchise groups `` can ride out the storm a lot longer , '' says Mr. Harty , the Burger King operator in New York .
wsj_1556	35	The prolonged price pressures are driving a wedge between some franchisers and their franchisees .
wsj_1556	36	Mr. Morrissey , the Kentucky Fried Chicken franchisee , notes that most franchise owners must absorb increases in expenses without any cut in the royalties , or portion of sales , that they must pay franchisers .
wsj_1556	37	Franchisees ca n't be forced to go along with a franchiser 's discounting .
wsj_1556	38	But once a franchisee agrees to a promotional program , the franchiser can demand full participation to the very end , says Lew Rudnick , a principal of Rudnick & Wolfe , a Chicago law firm with franchise industry clients .
wsj_1556	39	He says courts have held that antitrust considerations are outweighed in such cases by the need to protect consumers from deceptive marketing .
wsj_1556	40	In any case , many franchisees , in order to stay on good terms with franchisers , routinely go along with promotions .
wsj_1556	41	Says Mr. Riese of National Restaurants : `` If you resisted on prices , maybe you would never get that telephone call about a new franchise .

wsj_1559	0	CalMat Co. said it completed a $ 32.8 million sale of assets from its Los Angeles area real estate portfolio for net income of $ 12 million .
wsj_1559	1	CalMat said the sale is part of its previously announced plan to sell much of its real estate holdings to focus on its core business of mining and producing asphalt , concrete , rock and sand .
wsj_1561	0	USX Corp. and its Japanese partner , Kobe Steel Ltd. , agreed to form a joint venture to build a new plant to produce hot-dipped galvanized sheet products , mainly for the automotive market .
wsj_1561	1	Terms were n't disclosed for the plant , which will have annual capacity of 600,000 tons .
wsj_1561	2	The move by the nation 's largest steelmaker follows a string of earlier announcements by other major steel companies .
wsj_1561	3	Bethlehem Steel Corp. , LTV Corp. and Armco Inc. all have plans to build additional lines for such coated corrosion-resistant steel .
wsj_1561	4	The surge in production , analysts say , raises questions about capacity outpacing demand .
wsj_1561	5	They note that most of the new plants will come on line in 1992 , when the current import trade restraint program ends , which could result in more imports .
wsj_1561	6	`` There 's too much capacity , '' contended Charles Bradford , an analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets .
wsj_1561	7	`` I do n't think there 's anyone not building one . ''
wsj_1561	8	He does add , however , that transplanted Japanese car makers are boosting the levels of U.S.-made steel in their autos , instead of relying heavily on imported steel .
wsj_1561	9	That trend could increase demand for hot-dipped galvanized sheet .
wsj_1561	10	The hot-dipped galvanized segment is one of the fastest-growing and most profitable segments of the steel market , coveted by all major integrated steelmakers wanting to maintain an edge over smaller minimills and reconstructed mills -- those spun off to employees .
wsj_1561	11	Indeed , USX said it expects the market for coated sheet steel to reach 12 million tons annually by 1992 , compared with 10.2 million tons shipped in 1988 .
wsj_1561	12	For the first eight months of 1989 , analysts say shipments of hot-dipped galvanized steel increased about 8 % from a year earlier , while overall steel shipments were up only 2.4 % .
wsj_1561	13	USX and Kobe Steel hope to reach a definitive agreement establishing the 50-50 partnership by the end of the year , with construction tentatively slated for the spring of 1990 and production by 1992 .
wsj_1561	14	USX already has six lines in existing plants producing hot-dipped galvanized steel , but this marks the first so-called greenfield plant for such production .
wsj_1561	15	Moreover , it will boost by 50 % USX 's current hot-dipped capacity of 1,275,000 tons .
wsj_1561	16	The company said it does n't expect the new line 's capacity to adversely affect the company 's existing hot-dipped galvanizing lines .
wsj_1561	17	Steelmakers have also been adding capacity of so-called electrogalvanized steel , which is another way to make coated corrosion-resistant steel .
wsj_1561	18	One of the advantages of the hot-dipped process is that it allows the steel to be covered with a thicker coat of zinc more quickly .
wsj_1564	0	READY TO REVIEW the riskiness of your investment portfolio ?
wsj_1564	1	First , a pop quiz .
wsj_1564	2	When you think of the words `` risk '' and `` investment , '' what 's the specific peril that comes to mind ?
wsj_1564	3	If you 're like most people , you said it 's a holding that goes completely sour -- maybe a bond that defaults or a stock whose value disappears in a bankruptcy proceeding .
wsj_1564	4	`` People tend to see risk primarily on that one dimension , '' says Timothy Kochis , national director of personal financial planning for accountants Deloitte , Haskins & Sells .
wsj_1564	5	But therein lies another aspect of investment risk : the hazard of shaping your portfolio to avoid one or more types of risk and being blind-sided by others .
wsj_1564	6	This is clearly not good news to all you people who sleep like babies every night , lulled by visions of your money sitting risk-free in six-month CDs .
wsj_1564	7	Risk wears many disguises , and investments that are low in one type of obvious risk can be distressingly high in other , less obvious kinds .
wsj_1564	8	U.S. Treasury bonds , for example , are supersafe when it comes to returning money at maturity .
wsj_1564	9	But their value as investments can be decimated by inflation , which erodes the purchasing power of bonds ' fixed-dollar interest payments .
wsj_1564	10	Risk is also a function of time .
wsj_1564	11	When financial professionals measure risk mathematically , they usually focus on the volatility of short-term returns .
wsj_1564	12	Stocks are much riskier than Treasury bills , for example , because the range in performance from the best years to the worst is much wider .
wsj_1564	13	That is usually measured by the standard deviation , or divergence , of annual results from the average return over time .
wsj_1564	14	But investors who are preoccupied with short-term fluctuations may be paying too little attention to another big risk -- not generating enough money to meet long-term financial and life-style goals .
wsj_1564	15	For instance , some investors have sworn off stocks since the 1987 market crash ; last Friday 's debacle only reinforced those feelings .
wsj_1564	16	But the stock market , despite some stomach-churning declines , has far outperformed other securities over extended periods .
wsj_1564	17	By retreating to the apparent security of , say , money-market funds , investors may not be earning enough investment return to pay for a comfortable retirement .
wsj_1564	18	`` That 's the biggest risk of all -- the risk of not meeting your objectives , '' says Steven B. Enright , a New York financial planner with Seidman Financial Services .
wsj_1564	19	As a result , financial advisers say they take several steps when evaluating the riskiness of clients ' portfolios .
wsj_1564	20	They estimate the return a person 's current portfolio is likely to generate over time , along with a standard deviation that suggests how much the return will vary year by year .
wsj_1564	21	They try to figure out the long-term results the person needs to meet major goals .
wsj_1564	22	And they eyeball types of risk that are not easily quantified .
wsj_1564	23	The portfolios of two hypothetical families , one a couple at retirement age and another a two-income couple at age 45 , illustrate several types of risk that investors need to consider .
wsj_1564	24	For instance , the insured municipal bonds that dominate the older couple 's portfolio were probably selected in large part for their low repayment risk .
wsj_1564	25	But they expose the holders to a lot of inflation risk and interest-rate risk .
wsj_1564	26	The younger couple 's stockholdings involve more risk than a diversified stock portfolio because the bulk of the money is in a single issue .
wsj_1564	27	Note that the younger couple 's portfolio has a higher expected annual return , 10.1 % vs. 8.8 % , as calculated by Seidman Financial Services , which is the financial-planning affiliate of BDO Seidman .
wsj_1564	28	That largely reflects the heavy stockholdings .
wsj_1564	29	But one price paid for the higher expected return is greater short-term volatility , as reflected in the higher standard deviation that Seidman estimates for the younger couple 's portfolio .
wsj_1564	30	Here 's how to interpret a standard deviation figure : Take the expected return and add one standard deviation to it .
wsj_1564	31	Then take the expected return and subtract one standard deviation .
wsj_1564	32	In two of three years , the actual result should fall within that range if all the assumptions were accurate .
wsj_1564	33	Then add and subtract two standard deviations to get a wider range .
wsj_1564	34	There 's a 95 % probability any year 's result will fall in the range . )
wsj_1564	35	Of course , the greater volatility of the younger couple 's portfolio does n't necessarily mean those investments are riskier in terms of meeting the holders ' long-term goals .
wsj_1564	36	Indeed , the older couple 's portfolio could actually be riskier in that sense if the expected return wo n't generate enough dollars to meet their spending plans .
wsj_1564	37	`` They may feel emotionally secure now because they are not heavily in the stock market , '' says John H. Cammack , a financial planner with Alexandra Armstrong Advisors Inc. in Washington .

wsj_1564	39	Ms. Slater reports on personal finance from The Wall Street Journal 's New York bureau .
wsj_1564	40	When it comes to investing , trying to weigh risk and reward can seem like throwing darts blindfolded : Investors do n't know the actual returns that securities will deliver , or the ups and downs that will occur along the way .
wsj_1564	41	Looking to the past can provide some clues .
wsj_1564	42	Over several decades , for instance , investors who put up with the stock market 's gyrations earned returns far in excess of those on bonds and `` cash '' investments like Treasury bills .
wsj_1564	43	But while history can suggest what is reasonable to expect there 's no guarantee that the past will repeat itself .
wsj_1564	44	For instance , some analysts believe bond returns and volatility have moved permanently closer to those of the stock market .
wsj_1564	45	And returns on cash investments may continue to exceed inflation by a wider margin than they did over the long-term past .

wsj_1565	0	A letter from Senator John Kerry chides us today for implying that he had `` flip-flopped '' on Manuel Noriega .
wsj_1565	1	He correctly says he has been down on Noriega for some time , hence his criticism of administration mishandling of the attempted coup .
wsj_1565	2	Our October 12 editorial should have been more precise .
wsj_1565	3	It meant to convey our hope that the Senator and other members of the congressional left are broadening their dislike of Noriega to include other notorious Central American drug runners .

wsj_1571	0	In finding `` good news '' in Berkeley 's new freshman admissions plan `` The Privileged Class , '' editorial , Sept. 20 , you 're reading the headline but not the story .
wsj_1571	1	The plan indeed raises from 40 % to 50 % the number of freshmen applicants admitted strictly by academic criteria .
wsj_1571	2	But that does n't mean `` half of the students attending Berkeley '' will be admitted this way .
wsj_1571	3	The plan is talking about applicants admitted , not students who enroll .
wsj_1571	4	Since the `` yield '' from this top slice of applicants is relatively low , boosting admits from 40 % to 50 % will boost registrants from about 31 % to 38 % of the class .
wsj_1571	5	In addition , perhaps 5 % of registrants will come from a new category consisting of applicants whose academic credentials `` narrowly missed '' gaining them admission in the first category .
wsj_1571	6	But against that combined increase of 12 % in students chosen by academic criteria , the plan eliminates a large category in which admissions now are based on grades , test scores and `` supplemental points '' for factors such as high-school curriculum , English-language proficiency and an essay .
wsj_1571	7	This category now accounts for about 19 % of admits and 22 % of registrants .
wsj_1571	8	The plan thus will decrease by 22 % , for a net loss of 10 % , the number of students admitted primarily by academic criteria .
wsj_1571	9	Who will take over these places ?
wsj_1571	10	The plan creates a new category of students from `` socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds , '' a concept not yet defined , and gives them about 10 % of the class .
wsj_1571	11	One of the plan 's authors has defended the `` socioeconomic disadvantage '' category as perhaps making more sense than the current affirmative-action preferences based on race .
wsj_1571	12	Perhaps it does .
wsj_1571	13	But the new category does not replace or reduce Berkeley 's broad racial preferences .
wsj_1571	14	Nor will students from racial-minority groups who are admitted through the new category be counted against the affirmative-action `` target '' for their group .
wsj_1571	15	The plan thus places a large new affirmative-action program , based on `` socioeconomic disadvantage , '' on top of the existing program based on race .
wsj_1571	16	The role of academic criteria in choosing Berkeley 's freshmen can only decline as a result .

wsj_1575	0	Rorer Group Inc. will report that third-quarter profit rose more than 15 % from a year earlier , though the gain is wholly due to asset sales , Robert Cawthorn , chairman , president and chief executive officer , said .
wsj_1575	1	His projection indicates profit in the latest quarter of more than $ 17.4 million , or 55 cents a share , compared with $ 15.2 million , or 48 cents a share , a year ago .
wsj_1575	2	Mr. Cawthorn said in an interview that sales will show an increase from a year ago of `` somewhat less than 10 % . ''
wsj_1575	3	Through the first six months of 1989 , sales had grown about 12 % from the year-earlier period .
wsj_1575	4	Growth of 10 % would make sales for the latest quarter $ 269 million , compared with $ 244.6 million a year ago .
wsj_1575	5	Mr. Cawthorn said the profit growth in the latest quarter was due to the sale of two Rorer drugs .
wsj_1575	6	Asilone , an antacid , was sold to Boots PLC , London .
wsj_1575	7	Thrombinar , a drug used to stanch bleeding , was sold to Jones Medical Industries Inc. , St. Louis .
wsj_1575	8	He said Rorer sold the drugs for `` nice prices '' and will record a combined , pretax gain on the sales of $ 20 million .
wsj_1575	9	As the gain from the sales indicates , operating profit was `` significantly '' below the year-earlier level , Mr. Cawthorn said .
wsj_1575	10	Rorer in July had projected lower third-quarter operating profit but higher profit for all of 1989 .
wsj_1575	11	He said the company is still looking for `` a strong fourth quarter in all areas -- sales , operating income and net income . ''
wsj_1575	12	Mr. Cawthorn attributed the decline in third-quarter operating profit to the stronger dollar , which reduces the value of overseas profit when it is translated into dollars ; to accelerated buying of Rorer products in the second quarter because of a then-pending July 1 price increase , and to higher marketing expenses for Rorer 's Maalox antacid , whose sales and market share in the U.S. had slipped in the first half of 1989 .
wsj_1575	13	He said Rorer opted to sell Asilone and Thrombinar to raise revenue that would `` kick start '' its increased marketing efforts behind Maalox , still its top-selling product with about $ 215 million in world-wide sales in 1988 .
wsj_1575	14	`` We had underfunded Maalox for a year , '' he said , because the company was concentrating on research and development and promoting other drugs .
wsj_1575	15	He said Rorer will spend $ 15 million to $ 20 million more on Maalox advertising and promotion in the second half of 1989 than in the year-earlier period .
wsj_1575	16	A `` big chunk '' of that additional spending came in the third quarter , he said .

wsj_1581	0	The Senate rejected a constitutional amendment that President Bush sought to protect the U.S. flag from desecration .
wsj_1581	1	The 51-48 roll call fell well short of the two-thirds majority needed to approve changes to the Constitution .
wsj_1581	2	The vote , in which 11 GOP lawmakers voted against Mr. Bush 's position , was a victory for Democratic leaders , who opposed the amendment as an intrusion on the Bill of Rights .
wsj_1581	3	`` We can support the American flag without changing the American Constitution , '' said Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine .
wsj_1581	4	In order to defuse pressure for an amendment , Mr. Mitchell and House Speaker Thomas Foley D. , Wash . had arranged for lawmakers to pass a statute barring flag desecration before voting on the constitutional change .
wsj_1581	5	Mr. Bush said he would allow the bill to become law without his signature , because he said only a constitutional amendment can protect the flag adequately .

wsj_1582	0	If you think you have stress-related problems on the job , there 's good news and bad news .
wsj_1582	1	You 're probably right , and you are n't alone .
wsj_1582	2	A new Gallup Poll study commissioned by the New York Business Group on Health , found that a full 25 % of the work force at companies may suffer from anxiety disorders or a stress-related illness , with about 13 % suffering from depression .
wsj_1582	3	The study surveyed a national group of medical directors , personnel managers and employee assistance program directors about their perceptions of these problems in their companies .
wsj_1582	4	It is one of a series of studies on health commissioned by the New York Business Group , a non-profit organization with about 300 members .
wsj_1582	5	The stress study was undertaken because problems related to stress `` are much more prevalent than they seem , '' said Leon J. Warshaw , executive director of the business group .
wsj_1582	6	In presenting the study late last week , Dr. Warshaw estimated the cost of these types of disorders to business is substantial .
wsj_1582	7	Occupational disability related to anxiety , depression and stress costs about $ 8,000 a case in terms of worker 's compensation .
wsj_1582	8	In terms of days lost on the job , the study estimated that each affected employee loses about 16 work days a year because of stress , anxiety or depression .
wsj_1582	9	He added that the cost for stress-related compensation claims is about twice the average for all injury claims .
wsj_1582	10	`` We hope to sensitize employers '' to recognize the problems so they can do something about them , Dr. Warshaw said .
wsj_1582	11	Early intervention into these types of problems can apparently save businesses long-term expense associated with hospitalization , which sometimes results when these problems go untreated for too long .
wsj_1582	12	Even the courts are beginning to recognize the link between jobs and stress-related disorders in compensation cases , according to a survey by the National Council on Compensation Insurance .
wsj_1582	13	But although 56 % of the respondents in the study indicated that mental-health problems were fairly pervasive in the workplace , there is still a social stigma associated with people seeking help .
wsj_1582	14	The disorders , which 20 years ago struck middle-age and older people , `` now strike people at the height of productivity , '' says Robert M.A. Hirschfeld , of the National Institute of Mental Health , who spoke at the presentation of the study 's findings .
wsj_1582	15	The poll showed that company size had a bearing on a manager 's view of the problem , with 65 % of those in companies of more than 15,000 employees saying stress-related problems were `` fairly pervasive '' and 55 % of those in companies with fewer than 4,000 employees agreeing .
wsj_1582	16	The poll also noted fear of a takeover as a stress-producing event in larger companies .
wsj_1582	17	More than eight in 10 respondents reported such a stress-provoking situation in their company .
wsj_1582	18	Mid-sized companies were most affected by talk of layoffs or plant closings .
wsj_1582	19	The study , which received funding from Upjohn Co. , which makes several drugs to treat stress-related illnesses , also found 47 % of the managers said stress , anxiety and depression contribute to decreased production .
wsj_1582	20	Alcohol and substance abuse as a result of stress-related problems was cited by 30 % of those polled .
wsj_1582	21	Although Dr. Warshaw points out that stress and anxiety have their positive uses , `` stress perceived to be threatening implies a component of fear and anxiety that may contribute to burnout . ''
wsj_1582	22	He also noted that various work environments , such as night work , have their own `` stressors . ''
wsj_1582	23	`` We all like stress , but there 's a limit , '' says Paul D'Arcy , of Rohrer , Hibler & Replogle , a corporate psychology and management consulting firm .

wsj_1585	0	As the sponsor of the `` Older Americans Freedom to Work Act , '' which would repeal the Social Security earnings limit for people aged 65 and older , I applaud your strong endorsement to repeal this Depression-era fossil .
wsj_1585	1	For every dollar earned over $ 8,880 , Social Security recipients lose 50 cents of their Social Security benefits ; it 's like a 50 % marginal tax .

wsj_1585	3	Imagine a widow who wants to maintain her standard of living at the same level she had before she had to pay the catastrophic surtax .
wsj_1585	4	Although this widow earns only twice the minimum wage , largely due to the earnings limit , she would have to earn an additional $ 4,930 to offset her catastrophic surtax of $ 496 .
wsj_1585	5	Eliminating the earnings limit would greatly help seniors and reduce the deficit .

wsj_1587	4	The cafeteria remains closed .
wsj_1587	5	Dr. Andrew McBride , city health director , said his staff suspects the hepatitis , which can be highly contagious , was spread by the cafeteria worker with the virus .
wsj_1587	6	The exact strain of hepatitis that the cafeteria worker contracted has n't been determined but should be known by the end of the week , Dr. McBride said .
wsj_1587	7	Hepatitis A , considered the least dangerous strain of the virus , has been confirmed in at least one GTE employee , company and city officials said .
wsj_1587	8	`` From a public health point of view we 're relieved because hepatitis A is rarely life-threatening , '' said Dr. Frank Provato , GTE 's medical director .

wsj_1591	0	C. Olivetti & Co. , claiming it has won the race in Europe to introduce computers based on a powerful new microprocessor chip , unveiled its CP486 computer yesterday .
wsj_1591	1	The product is the first from a European company based on Intel Corp. 's new 32-bit 486tm microprocessor , which works several times faster than previously available chips .
wsj_1591	2	Hewlett-Packard Co. became the first company world-wide to announce a product based on the chip earlier this month , but it wo n't start shipping the computers until early next year .
wsj_1591	3	An Olivetti spokesman said the company 's factories are already beginning to produce the machine , and that it should be available in Europe by December .
wsj_1591	4	`` What this means is that Europeans will have these machines in their offices before Americans do , '' the spokesman said .
wsj_1591	5	The new chip `` is a very big step in computing , and it is important that Olivetti be one of the first out on the market with this product , '' said Patricia Meagher Davis , an analyst at James Capel & Co. in London .
wsj_1591	6	Executives at Olivetti , whose earnings have been steadily sliding over the past couple of years , have acknowledged that in the past they have lagged at getting new technology to market .
wsj_1591	7	Ms. Davis said the new machines could steal some sales away from Olivetti 's own minicomputers , but would bring new sales among professionals such as engineers , stockbrokers and medical doctors .
wsj_1591	8	Although Olivetti 's profits tumbled 40 % in the first half of this year , she believes Olivetti 's restructuring last fall and its introduction of new products will begin to bear fruit with an earnings rebound next year , especially if it can fulfill its promise to deliver the new machines by December .
wsj_1591	9	`` We think the worst is over '' in the European information-technology market , she said .
wsj_1591	10	Depending on the type of software and peripherals used , the machines can serve either as the main computer in a network of many terminals a role usually filled by a minicomputer , as a technical workstation or as a very fast personal computer .
wsj_1591	11	`` It 's the missing link '' in Olivetti 's product line between small personal computers and higher-priced minicomputers , the Olivetti spokesman said .
wsj_1591	12	He added that Olivetti will continue making its LSX minicomputer line .
wsj_1591	13	The machines will cost around $ 16,250 on average in Europe .

wsj_1596	6	A spokesman also said margins for the company 's service business narrowed somewhat because of heavy investments made in that sector .
wsj_1596	7	The lack of a strong product at the high end of Digital 's line was a significant drag on sales .
wsj_1596	8	Digital hopes to address that with the debut of its first mainframe-class computers next Tuesday .
wsj_1596	9	The new line is aimed directly at International Business Machines Corp .
wsj_1596	10	`` Until the new mainframe products kick in , there wo n't be a lot of revenue contribution at the high end , and that 's hurt us , '' said Mark Steinkrauss , Digital 's director of investor relations .
wsj_1596	11	He said unfavorable currency translations were also a factor in the quarter .
wsj_1596	12	DEC shares rose $ 1.375 to $ 89.75 apiece in consolidated New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday .
wsj_1596	13	But analysts said that against the backdrop of a nearly 40-point rise in the Dow Jones Industrial Average , that should n't necessarily be taken as a sign of great strength .
wsj_1596	14	Some cut their earnings estimates for the stock this year and predicted more efforts to control costs ahead .
wsj_1596	15	`` I think the next few quarters will be difficult , '' said Steven Milunovich of First Boston .
wsj_1596	16	`` Margins will remain under pressure , and when the new mainframe does ship , I 'm not sure it will be a big winner .
wsj_1596	17	'' Mr. Milunovich said he was revising his estimate for DEC 's current year from $ 8.20 a share to `` well below $ 8 , '' although he has n't settled on a final number .
wsj_1596	18	One troubling aspect of DEC 's results , analysts said , was its performance in Europe .
wsj_1596	19	DEC said its overseas business , which now accounts for more than half of sales , improved in the quarter .
wsj_1596	20	It even took the unusually frank step of telling analysts in a morning conference call that orders in Europe were up in `` double digits '' in foreign-currency terms .
wsj_1596	21	That gain probably translated into about 5 % to 7 % in dollar terms , well below recent quarters ' gains of above 20 % , reckons Jay Stevens of Dean Witter Reynolds .
wsj_1596	22	`` That was a disappointment '' and a sign of overall computer-market softness in Europe , Mr. Stevens said .
wsj_1596	23	Marc Schulman , with UBS Securities in New York , dropped his estimate of DEC 's full-year net to $ 6.80 a share from $ 8 .
wsj_1596	24	Although overall revenues were stronger , Mr. Schulman said , DEC `` drew down its European backlog '' and had flat world-wide orders overall .
wsj_1596	25	`` The bottom line is that it 's more hand to mouth than it has been before , '' he said .
wsj_1596	26	Mr. Schulman said he believes that the roll-out of DEC 's new mainframe will `` occur somewhat more leisurely '' than many of his investment colleagues expect .
wsj_1596	27	He said current expectations are for an entry level machine to be shipped in December , with all of the more sophisticated versions out by June .
wsj_1596	28	For reasons he would n't elaborate on , he said he 's sure that schedule wo n't be met , meaning less profit impact from the product for DEC in the next few quarters .

wsj_1597	0	Colgate Palmolive Co. reported third-quarter net income rose 27 % , bolstered by strong sales in its Latin American business and surprisingly healthy profits from U.S. operations .
wsj_1597	1	Colgate said net income for the quarter rose to $ 76.7 million , or $ 1.06 a share , on sales that increased 6 % to $ 1.3 billion .
wsj_1597	2	In the year-earlier period , Colgate posted net income of $ 60.2 million , or 88 cents a share .
wsj_1597	3	Last year 's results included earnings from discontinued operations of $ 13.1 million , or 19 cents a share .
wsj_1597	4	Reuben Mark , chairman and chief executive officer of Colgate , said earnings growth was fueled by strong sales in Latin America , the Far East and Europe .
wsj_1597	5	Results were also bolstered by `` a very meaningful increase in operating profit at Colgate 's U.S. business , '' he said .
wsj_1597	6	Operating profit at Colgate 's U.S. household products and personal care businesses , which include such well-known brands as Colgate toothpaste and Fab laundry detergent , jumped more than 40 % , the company said .
wsj_1597	7	Mr. Mark attributed the improvement to cost savings achieved by consolidating manufacturing operations , blending together two sales organizations and more carefully focusing the company 's promotional activities .
wsj_1597	8	`` We 've done a lot to improve U.S. . results and a lot more will be done , '' Mr. Mark said .
wsj_1597	9	`` Improving profitability of U.S. operations is an extremely high priority in the company . ''
wsj_1597	10	Colgate 's results were at the high end of the range of analysts ' forecasts .
wsj_1597	11	The scope of the improvement in the U.S. business caught some analysts by surprise .
wsj_1597	12	The company 's domestic business , especially its household products division , has performed poorly for years .
wsj_1597	13	Analysts say the earnings improvement came from cutting costs rather than increasing sales .
wsj_1597	14	For the nine months , net increased 14 % to $ 217.5 million , or $ 3.09 a share .
wsj_1597	15	Sales rose 7 % to $ 3.8 billion .
wsj_1597	16	The company earned $ 191.1 million , or $ 2.79 a share , in the year-earlier period .
wsj_1597	17	Colgate 's 1988 net income included $ 40.1 million , or 59 cents a share , from discontinued operations .
wsj_1597	18	Colgate sold its hospital supply and home health care business last year .
wsj_1597	19	Separately , Colgate Wednesday finalized an agreement with MacroChem Corp. , a tiny dental products and pharmaceutical concern based in Billerica , Mass. , to market in the U.S. four of MacroChem 's FDA-approved dental products .
wsj_1597	20	The products -- sealants and bonding materials used by dentists -- all contain fluoride that is released over time .
wsj_1597	21	The move is part of a drive to increase Colgate 's business with dentists , a company spokeswoman said .
wsj_1597	22	Terms of the agreement were n't given .
wsj_1598	0	USACafes Limited Partnership said it completed the sale of its Bonanza restaurant franchise system to a subsidiary of Metromedia Co. for $ 71 million in cash .
wsj_1598	1	USACafes , which is nearly half-owned by Sam and Charles Wyly of Dallas , said it will distribute proceeds from the sale to unit holders as a liquidating dividend as soon as possible .
wsj_1598	2	The Bonanza franchise system , which generates about $ 600 million in sales annually , represented substantially all of the partnership 's assets .
wsj_1598	3	The sale of the system has been challenged in a class-action suit on behalf of unit holders filed last week in a Delaware court , USACafes said .
wsj_1598	4	The company said it believes the suit is without merit .
wsj_1601	0	Short interest on the New York Stock Exchange declined for the second consecutive month , this time 4.2 % , while the American Stock Exchange reported its third consecutive record month of short interest .

wsj_1601	4	Amex short interest has been heading upward since mid-December , with increases in each month since then except at mid-July .
wsj_1601	5	Traders who sell short borrow stock and sell it , betting that the stock 's price will decline and that they can buy the shares back later at a lower price for return to the lender .
wsj_1601	6	Short interest is the number of shares that have n't yet been purchased for return to lenders .
wsj_1601	7	Although a substantial short position reflects heavy speculation that a stock 's price will decline , some investors consider an increase in short interest bullish because the borrowed shares eventually must be bought back .
wsj_1601	8	Fluctuation in short interest of certain stocks also may be caused partly by arbitraging .
wsj_1601	9	The figures occasionally include incomplete transactions in restricted stock .
wsj_1601	10	The level of negative sentiment measured by the Big Board short interest ratio slipped to 3.36 from last month 's 3.38 .
wsj_1601	11	The ratio is the number of trading days , at the exchange 's average trading volume , that would be required to convert the total short interest position .
wsj_1601	12	Some analysts suggest , however , that the ratio has weakened in value as an indicator because options and other products can be used to hedge short positions .
wsj_1601	13	Varity Corp. led the Big Board list of largest short volumes with 12,822,563 shares .

wsj_1602	0	Your Oct. 12 editorial `` Pitiful , Helpless Presidency ? '' correctly states that I was critical of the Bush administration 's failure to have any plan in place to respond in a timely fashion to the opportunities to oust Manuel Noriega presented by the attempted military coup on Oct. 3 .
wsj_1602	1	You are absolutely wrong , however , in opining that this position is some kind of `` flip-flop , '' something newly arrived at as a result of reading the opinion polls .
wsj_1602	2	My position is one founded on both the facts and the law .
wsj_1602	3	Although you may have forgotten , public opinion about Gen. Noriega is where it is in large measure because of my investigation of his years of involvement in narcotics smuggling and simultaneous work as a U.S. operative .
wsj_1602	4	The public made up its mind about Gen. Noriega largely as a result of the hearings I chaired in the Subcommittee on Terrorism and Narcotics of the Foreign Relations Committee on Feb. 8 , 9 , 10 and 11 , 1988 , and again on April 4 , 1988 .
wsj_1602	5	It was during those hearings that the nation first learned the breadth and depth of Gen. Noriega 's criminality , and of his enduring relationships with a variety of U.S. government agencies .
wsj_1602	6	Those hearings also highlighted how Gen. Noriega was able to use his relationships with these agencies to delay U.S. action against him , and to exploit the administration 's obsession with overthrowing the Sandinistas to protect his own drug-dealing .
wsj_1602	7	As former Ambassador to Costa Rica Francis J. McNeil testified before the subcommittee , the Reagan administration knew that Gen. Noriega was involved with narcotics , but made a decision in the summer of 1986 `` to put Gen. Noriega on the shelf until Nicaragua was settled . ''
wsj_1602	8	As the report issued by the subcommittee concluded , `` Our government did nothing regarding Gen. Noriega 's drug business and substantial criminal involvement because the first priority was the Contra war .
wsj_1602	9	This decision resulted in at least some drugs entering the United States as a hidden cost of the war . ''
wsj_1602	10	Unfortunately , this problem continued even after Gen. Noriega 's indictment .
wsj_1602	11	Throughout 1988 and this year , I and others in Congress have pressed the U.S. to develop a plan for pushing this `` narcokleptocrat '' out of Panama .
wsj_1602	12	Regrettably , two administrations in a row have been unwilling and unable to develop any plan , military or economic , for supporting the Panamanian people in their attempts to restore democracy .

wsj_1604	0	The earthquake that hit the San Francisco Bay area is n't likely to result in wholesale downgrading of bond ratings , officials at the two major rating agencies said .
wsj_1604	1	Standard & Poor 's Corp. is reviewing debt issued by 12 California counties , and `` there are potential isolated problems , '' said Hyman Grossman , a managing director .
wsj_1604	2	The agency is preparing a report , to be issued today , on the earthquake 's impact on the property- and casualty-insurance industry .
wsj_1604	3	The only securities so far to be singled out are those issued by Bay View Federal Savings & Loan .
wsj_1604	4	Moody 's Investors Service Inc. said it is reviewing , with an eye toward a possible downgrade , the ratings on Bay View Federal bonds , long-term deposits and the preferred-stock rating of its parent company , Bay View Capital Corp .
wsj_1604	5	As for property and casualty insurers , Moody 's said `` preliminary estimates suggest that losses should not have a significant impact on most insurers ' financial condition , '' but it `` raises concerns about potentially substantial risks '' longer-term .

wsj_1606	0	Western Digital Corp. reported a net loss of $ 2.7 million , or nine cents a share , for its first quarter ended Sept. 30 , citing factors as varied as hurricane damage , an advance in graphics technology and the strengthening dollar .
wsj_1606	1	In the year-ago period , the company earned $ 12.9 million , or 45 cents a share , on sales of $ 247 million .
wsj_1606	2	Sales for the just-ended period fell to about $ 225 million , the maker of computer parts said .
wsj_1606	3	Nonetheless , Chairman Roger W. Johnson said he expects the company to be profitable in the current quarter .
wsj_1606	4	`` We are positioned to come through , '' he said , noting that the company 's backlog was up from the previous quarter .
wsj_1606	5	In its second quarter last year , Western Digital earned $ 12.7 million , or 44 cents a share , on sales of $ 258.4 million .
wsj_1606	6	Mr. Johnson said Western Digital 's plant in Puerto Rico was affected by Hurricane Hugo , losing three days ' production because of the storm , which wrecked much of the Caribbean island 's infrastructure .
wsj_1606	7	Although the plant itself was n't damaged , Mr. Johnson said millions of dollars in first-quarter revenue were lost .
wsj_1606	8	The revenue will be regained in the current period , he added .
wsj_1606	9	There are no plans to initiate a common stock dividend , Mr. Johnson said , explaining that the board continues to believe shareholders are best served by reinvesting excess cash .
wsj_1606	10	Mr. Johnson said the first-quarter loss also heavily reflected a rapid change in graphics technology that left reseller channels with too many of the old computer graphics boards and too few new monitors compatible with the new graphics boards .
wsj_1606	11	Western Digital does n't make the monitors .
wsj_1606	12	An accelerating move by personal computer manufacturers ' to include advanced graphics capabilities as standard equipment further dampened reseller purchases of Western Digital 's equipment .
wsj_1606	13	`` The other areas of the business -- storage and microcomputers -- were very good , '' Mr. Johnson said .
wsj_1606	14	He said Western Digital has reacted swiftly to the movement to video graphics array , VGA , graphics technology from the old enhanced graphics adapter , EGA , which has a lower resolution standard , technology and now is one of the leading producers of these newer units .
wsj_1606	15	Other makers of video controller equipment also were caught in the EGA-VGA shift , he said , `` but we were able to respond much more quickly . ''
wsj_1606	16	Still , Mr. Johnson said , `` our stock is grossly undervalued . ''
wsj_1606	17	He said the company has cut operating expenses by about 10 % over the last few quarters , while maintaining research and development at about 8 % to 9 % of sales .
wsj_1606	18	As part of its reorganization this week , Western Digital has divided its business into two segments -- storage products , including controllers and disk drives ; and microcomputer products , which include graphics , communications and peripheral control chips .
wsj_1606	19	Graphics , communications and peripheral control chips were combined because , increasingly , multiple functions are being governed by a single chip .
wsj_1606	20	Storage , which includes computer controllers and 3.5-inch disk drives , represents nearly two-thirds of the company 's business .
wsj_1606	21	Disk drives , which allow a computer to access its memory , generated 38 % more revenue in the most recent period compared with the fiscal first quarter a year earlier .
wsj_1606	22	Computer parts are getting ever smaller , Mr. Johnson said , a shrinking that has propelled laptops into position as the fastest-growing segment of the computer business .
wsj_1606	23	As smaller and more powerful computers continue to be the focus of the industry , he said , Western Digital is strengthening development of laptop parts .
wsj_1606	24	Next year Western Digital plans to consolidate its operations from 11 buildings in Irvine into two buildings in the same city a new headquarters and , a block away , a modern $ 100 million silicon wafer fabrication plant .
wsj_1606	25	The plan will help the company in its existing joint manufacturing agreement with AT&T .
wsj_1606	26	About half of Western Digital 's business is overseas , and Mr. Johnson expects that proportion to continue .
wsj_1606	27	Plans to dissolve many of the trade barriers within Europe in 1992 creates significant opportunities for the company , he said , particularly since Western Digital already manufactures there .
wsj_1606	28	Capitalizing on that presence , Western Digital is launching a major effort to develop the embryonic reseller market in Europe .
wsj_1607	0	Directors of state-owned Banca Nazionale del Lavoro approved a two-step capital-boosting transaction and a change in the bank 's rules that will help it operate more like a private-sector institution .
wsj_1607	1	Until now , BNL 's top managers and its directors have been appointed by a Treasury decree .
wsj_1607	2	But under the bank 's proposed statutes , an assembly of shareholders must approve board members .
wsj_1607	3	The bank 's chairman and director general , who also sit on the board , still would be appointed by the Treasury .
wsj_1607	4	BNL , which is controlled by the Italian Treasury , was rocked by the disclosure last month that its Atlanta branch extended more than $ 3 billion in unauthorized credits to Iraq .
wsj_1607	5	The ensuing scandal , in which the bank 's management resigned , has helped renew calls for privatization , or at least an overhaul , of Italy 's banking system , which is about 80 % state-controlled .
wsj_1607	6	In a related move , the bank also proposed that board representation be linked more closely to the bank 's new shareholding structure .
wsj_1607	7	BNL called a shareholders ' assembly meeting in December to vote on the proposals .

wsj_1610	3	Per-share net of 66 cents , down from 72 cents , fell by more than overall net because of more shares outstanding .
wsj_1610	4	The company said that improved results in its financial-services sector were negated by increased costs in its government contract business , lower operating earnings in its commercial-products sector and soft automotive markets .
wsj_1610	5	Net was aided by a lower income tax rate .

wsj_1610	10	Textron said that nine-months ' results do n't include earnings of Avdel PLC , a British maker of industrial fasteners , but do include interest costs of $ 16.4 million on borrowings related to the proposed purchase of Avdel .
wsj_1610	11	A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction against the purchase because of Federal Trade Commission concerns that the transaction would reduce competition in the production of two kinds of rivets .

wsj_1612	3	Society Corp. already has branches in the area , and selling the Trustcorp offices could avoid a problem with regulators over excessive concentration of banking in the two counties after the merger of Trustcorp into Society , according to industry sources .
wsj_1612	4	The merger is scheduled to take place in the 1990 first quarter .
wsj_1613	0	Stock-market fears and relatively more attractive interest rates pushed money-market mutual fund assets up $ 6.07 billion in the latest week , the sharpest increase in almost two years .
wsj_1613	1	The 473 funds tracked by the Investment Company Institute , a Washington-based trade group , rose to $ 356.1 billion , a record .
wsj_1613	2	The $ 6.07 billion increase was the strongest weekly inflow since January 1988 .
wsj_1613	3	The increase was spread fairly evenly among all three types of funds .
wsj_1613	4	Individual investors , represented in the general-purpose and broker-dealer fund categories , pulled money from the stock market after its big drop last Friday and put the money into funds , said Jacob Dreyer , vice president and chief economist of the Institute .
wsj_1613	5	`` Insitutional investors , on the other hand , reacted to the steep decline in yields on direct money-market instruments following the stock-market decline last Friday , '' Mr. Dreyer said .
wsj_1613	6	Yields on money funds dropped in the week ended Tuesday , according to Donoghue 's Money Fund Report , a Holliston , Mass. , newsletter .
wsj_1613	7	The average seven-day compounded yield fell to 8.55 % from 8.60 % the week earlier , Donoghue 's said .
wsj_1613	8	At the auction of six-month U.S. Treasury bills on Monday , the average yield fell to 7.61 % from 7.82 % .
wsj_1613	9	Likewise , certificates of deposit on average posted lower yields in the week ended Tuesday .
wsj_1613	10	The 142 institutional-type money funds rose $ 2.23 billion to $ 85.49 billion .
wsj_1613	11	The 235 general-purpose funds increased $ 2.53 billion to $ 116.56 billion , while 96 broker-dealer funds increased $ 1.3 billion to $ 154.05 billion .
wsj_1614	0	Domestic lending for real estate and property development was the source of Bank Bumiputra Malaysia Bhd. 's most recent spate of financial troubles , the institution 's executive chairman , Mohamed Basir Ismail , said .
wsj_1614	1	Speaking to reporters this week after Bank Bumiputra 's shareholders approved a rescue plan , Tan Sri Basir said heavy lending to the property sector rocked the bank when property prices in Malaysia plummeted in 1984-85 .
wsj_1614	2	He said the bank could n't wait any longer for prices to recover and for borrowers to service their loans .
wsj_1614	3	So the bank 's board decided to make 1.23 billion Malaysian dollars US$ 457 million in provisions for interest payments from loans previously recorded as revenue but never actually received by the bank , and to submit a bailout package to replenish the bank 's paid-up capital .
wsj_1614	4	The predicament , he added , was similar to the Hong Kong 1982-83 property-price collapse , which exposed the involvement of Bank Bumiputra 's former subsidiary in the colony in the largest banking scandal in Malaysia 's history .
wsj_1614	5	The subsidiary , Bumiputra Malaysia Finance Ltd. , was left with M$ 2.26 billion in bad loans made to Hong Kong property speculators .
wsj_1614	6	Both episodes wiped out Bank Bumiputra 's shareholders ' funds .
wsj_1614	7	Each time , the bank 's 90 % shareholder -- Petroliam Nasional Bhd. , or Petronas , the national oil company -- has been called upon to rescue the institution .
wsj_1614	8	In five years , Petronas , which became the dominant shareholder in a 1984 rescue exercise , has spent about M$ 3.5 billion to prop up the troubled bank .
wsj_1614	9	Tan Sri Basir said the capital restructuring plan has been approved by Malaysia 's Capital Issues Committee and central bank .
wsj_1614	10	Malaysia 's High Court is expected to approve the plan .
wsj_1614	11	Once the plan is approved , Tan Sri Basir said , most of Bank Bumiputra 's nonperforming loans will have been fully provided for and the bank will be on track to report a pretax profit of between M$ 160 million and M$ 170 million for the fiscal year ending March 31 .
wsj_1614	12	For the previous financial year , the bank would have reported a pretax profit of M$ 168 million if it had n't made provisions for the nonperforming loans , he said .
wsj_1614	13	Malaysia 's Banking Secrecy Act prohibited the bank from identifying delinquent borrowers , said Tan Sri Basir .
wsj_1614	14	But public documents indicate 10 % or more of the bank 's provisions were made for foregone interest on a M$ 200 million loan to Malaysia 's dominant political party , the United Malays National Organization , to build its convention and headquarters complex in Kuala Lumpur .
wsj_1614	15	The loan to UMNO was made in September 1983 .
wsj_1614	16	`` We lent a lot of money all over the place , '' said Tan Sri Basir , who refused to discuss the bank 's outstanding loans to
wsj_1614	17	As well as the M$ 1.23 billion in provisions announced on Oct. 6 , the restructuring package covers an additional M$ 450 million in provisions made in earlier years but never reflected in a reduction of the bank 's paid-up capital .
wsj_1614	18	At the end of the exercise , the cash injection from Petronas will increase the bank 's paid-up capital to M$ 1.15 billion after virtually being wiped out by the new provisions .
wsj_1619	0	The disarray in the junk-bond market that began last month with a credit crunch at Campeau Corp. has offered commercial banks a golden opportunity to play a greater role in financing billion-dollar takeovers .
wsj_1619	1	But two big New York banks seem to have kicked those chances away , for the moment , with the embarrassing failure of Citicorp and Chase Manhattan Corp. to deliver $ 7.2 billion in bank financing for a leveraged buy-out of United Airlines parent UAL Corp .
wsj_1619	2	For more than a decade , banks have been pressing Congress and banking regulators for expanded powers to act like securities firms in playing Wall Street 's lucrative takeover game , from giving mergers advice all the way to selling and trading high-yield junk bonds .
wsj_1619	3	Those expanded powers reached their zenith in July when Bankers Trust New York Corp. provided mergers advice , an equity investment and bank loans for the $ 3.65 billion leveraged buy-out of Northwest Airlines parent NWA Inc .
wsj_1619	4	One of the major selling points used by Los Angeles financier Alfred Checchi in getting the takeover approved was that the deal did n't include any junk bonds .
wsj_1619	5	That was seen as an advantage in lobbying airline employees and Washington regulators for approval of the contested takeover .
wsj_1619	6	All $ 3.35 billion in debt for the deal was supplied by banks .
wsj_1619	7	Charles Nathan , co-head of mergers and acquisitions at Salomon Brothers Inc. , says it is natural for banks to try to expand beyond their bread-and-butter business of providing senior debt for buy-outs .
wsj_1619	8	But the UAL collapse , he says , `` may tell you it 's not going to work that easily . ''
wsj_1619	9	David Batchelder , a mergers adviser in La Jolla , Calif. , who aided Los Angeles investor Marvin Davis on the bids which put both UAL and NWA in play as takeover candidates this year , says that banks have been `` preparing to play a larger and larger role in acquisition financing . ''
wsj_1619	10	Mr. Batchelder says that in the past , banks would normally have loaned 65 % of a total buy-out price , with the loans secured by the target company 's assets .
wsj_1619	11	Another 20 % of the borrowed funds would come from the sale to investors of junk bonds , which offer less security and typically carry higher yields than bank loans .
wsj_1619	12	Mr. Checchi 's purchase of NWA , Mr. Batchelder notes , `` was probably the most aggressive to date , '' with bank debt at 85 % of the purchase price .
wsj_1619	13	But Mr. Batchelder says that Citicorp 's `` failure to deliver '' on its promise to raise the UAL bank debt for a labor-management buy-out group `` is very distressing to potential users of a ` highly-confident ' letter from commercial banks . ''
wsj_1619	14	His client , Mr. Davis , used just such a letter from Citicorp in pursuing UAL ; Citicorp later agreed to work with a competing UAL buy-out group .
wsj_1619	15	Executives of Citicorp and Chase Manhattan declined to comment on either the UAL situation , or on the changing nature of banks ' role in financing takeovers .
wsj_1619	16	In the wake of Campeau 's problems , prices of junk bonds tumbled , throwing into doubt the ability of corporate acquirers to finance large takeovers with the help of junk bond sales .
wsj_1619	17	Mark Solow , senior managing director at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. , says the falloff in junk bonds may yet open new business opportunities to banks in structuring takeovers .
wsj_1619	18	But he warns that banks will have `` to have enough discipline '' not to make loans that are too risky .
wsj_1619	19	In fact , Manufacturers Hanover said in its third-quarter earnings report that fees from syndicating loans to other banks dropped 48 % , to $ 21 million .
wsj_1619	20	`` We did n't take part in a lot of deals because their credit quality was poor , '' says a bank spokesman .
wsj_1619	21	James B. Lee , head of syndications and private placements at Chemical Banking Corp. , said he believes banks can still make a credible offer of one-stop shopping for takeover finance .
wsj_1619	22	As evidence , he cites yesterday 's arrangement for the final financing of a $ 3 billion bid for American Medical International Inc. in which Chemical served as both the lead bank and an equity investor .
wsj_1619	23	Beyond the current weakness in the junk bond market , banks have another advantage over investment banks in financing contested takeovers .
wsj_1619	24	Arthur Fleischer Jr. , a takeover lawyer at Fried Frank Harris Shriver & Jacobson , notes that `` a political and emotional bias '' has developed against junk bonds .
wsj_1619	25	One hostile bidder who deliberately avoided using junk bonds was Paramount Communications Inc. in its initial offer to acquire Time Inc. for $ 10.7 billion , or $ 175 a share .
wsj_1619	26	A Paramount spokesman says that decision was based on the financial , not political , drawbacks of junk bonds .
wsj_1619	27	But some observers believe Paramount Chairman Martin Davis wanted to avoid the possible taint of being perceived as a corporate raider in his controversial bid for Time .
wsj_1619	28	In the end , Mr. Davis used junk bonds so that he could raise Paramount 's bid to $ 200 a share .
wsj_1619	29	Some Monday-morning quarterbacks said the initial lower bid , without junk bonds , was a factor in his losing the company .
wsj_1619	30	Time eluded Paramount by acquiring Warner Communications Inc .
wsj_1619	31	The success of the NWA financing , and the failure of the UAL deal , also seem to highlight the important new role in takeover financing being played by Japanese banks .
wsj_1619	32	Japanese banks accounted for 50 % of the NWA bank debt , according to a report by Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner .
wsj_1619	33	But it was broad-scale rejection by Japanese banks that helped seal the fate of the attempt to buy UAL .
wsj_1619	34	Citicorp and Chase are attempting to put together a new , lower bid .
wsj_1619	35	Takanori Mizuno , chief economist of the Institute for Financial Affairs Inc. , a Tokyo research center on finance and economics , says , `` The junk bond market became very jittery , and there 's a fear of a coming recession and the possible bankruptcy of LBO companies .
wsj_1620	0	Harley-Davidson Inc. filed suit in federal court here , alleging that a group that holds 6.2 % of its stock made `` false , deceptive and misleading '' statements in recent regulatory filings and public announcements .
wsj_1620	1	Harley-Davidson 's complaint claims that the group , led by investor Malcolm I. Glazer , violated securities laws by failing to disclose plans to purchase 15 % of the company 's shares outstanding and that when the required Hart-Scott-Rodino filing eventually was made , it did n't disclose the group 's alleged earlier violation of the so-called prior-notice requirements of the law .
wsj_1620	2	Mr. Glazer could n't immediately be reached to comment .
wsj_1620	3	But when Harley last week publicly questioned the legality of the group 's filing procedures , the Rochester , N.Y. , investor said `` we complied with every law , '' and he denied any wrongdoing .
wsj_1620	4	The Glazer group said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing in early October that it may seek a controlling interest in Harley-Davidson , or seek representation on the company 's board .
wsj_1620	5	Harley has said it does n't intend to be acquired by the Glazer group or any other party .
wsj_1621	0	Inland Steel Industries Inc. , battered by lower volume and higher costs , posted a 75 % drop in third-quarter earnings .
wsj_1621	1	The nation 's fourth-largest steelmaker earned $ 18.3 million , or 43 cents a share , compared with $ 61 million , or $ 1.70 a share , a year earlier , when the industry was enjoying peak demand and strong pricing .
wsj_1621	2	Sales fell to $ 981.2 million from $ 1.02 billion .
wsj_1621	3	The earnings also mark a significant drop from the second quarter 's $ 45.3 million or $ 1.25 a share .
wsj_1621	4	Moreover , the earnings were well below analysts ' expectations of about $ 1.16 a share .
wsj_1621	5	In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange , Inland closed yesterday at $ 35.875 a share , down $ 1 .
wsj_1621	6	The company attributed the earnings drop to lower volume related to seasonal demand and the soft consumer durable market , especially in the automotive sector .
wsj_1621	7	However , the company also lost orders because of prolonged labor talks in the second quarter .
wsj_1621	8	Third-quarter shipments slipped 7 % from the year-ago period , and 17 % from this year 's second quarter .
wsj_1621	9	Profit of steel shipped for the company 's steel segment slid to $ 26 a ton , from $ 66 a ton a year earlier and $ 57 a ton a quarter earlier .
wsj_1621	10	Analysts noted that the disappointing results do n't reflect lower prices for steel products .
wsj_1621	11	Charles Bradford , an analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets , said higher prices for galvanized and cold-rolled products offset lower prices for bar , hot-rolled and structural steel .
wsj_1621	12	Structural steel , which primarily serves the construction market , was especially hurt by a 15 % price drop , Mr. Bradford said .
wsj_1621	13	The company said its integrated steel sector was also hurt by higher raw material , repair and maintenance , and labor costs .
wsj_1621	14	The increased labor costs became effective Aug. 1 under terms of the four-year labor agreement with the United Steelworkers union .
wsj_1621	15	Meanwhile , the company 's service center segment , which saw operating profit drop to $ 11.5 million from $ 30.7 million a year ago , experienced much of the same demand and cost problems , as well as start-up costs associated with a coil processing facility in Chicago and an upgraded computer information system .
wsj_1621	16	Inland Chairman Frank W. Luerssen said the company 's short-term outlook is `` clouded by uncertainties in the economy and financial markets . ''
wsj_1621	17	However , he noted that steel mill bookings are up from early summer levels , and that he expects the company to improve its cost performance in the fourth quarter .
wsj_1621	18	In the first nine months , profit was $ 113 million , or $ 3.04 a share , on sales of $ 3.19 billion , compared with $ 204.5 million , or $ 5.76 a share , on sales of $ 3.03 billion , ) a year earlier .
wsj_1622	0	The `` seismic '' activity of a financial market bears a resemblance to the seismic activity of the earth .
wsj_1622	1	When things are quiet low volatility , the structures on which markets stand can be relatively inefficient and still perform their functions adequately .
wsj_1622	2	However , when powerful forces start shaking the market 's structure , the more `` earthquake-resistant '' it is , the better its chance for survival .
wsj_1622	3	America 's financial markets do not yet have all the required modern features required to make them fully `` aftershock-resistant . ''
wsj_1622	4	Investors lack equal access to the markets ' trading arena and its information .
wsj_1622	5	That structural lack is crucial because investors are the only source of market liquidity .
wsj_1622	6	And liquidity is what markets need to damp quakes and aftershocks .
wsj_1622	7	In today 's markets , specialists on the New York Stock Exchange and `` upstairs '' market makers in the over-the-counter market are the only market participants allowed to play a direct role in the price-determination process .
wsj_1622	8	When they halt trading , all market liquidity is gone .
wsj_1622	9	And when any component of the market -- cash , futures or options -- loses liquidity , the price discovery system the way prices are determined becomes flawed or is lost entirely for a time .
wsj_1622	10	Last Friday the 13th as well as two years ago this week the markets became unlinked .
wsj_1622	11	When that happened , `` seismic '' tremors of fear -- much like the shock waves created by an earthquake -- coursed through the market and increased the market 's volatility .
wsj_1622	12	Lack of important , needed information can cause fear .
wsj_1622	13	Fear is the father of panic .
wsj_1622	14	Panic frequently results in irrational behavior .
wsj_1622	15	And in financial markets , irrational behavior is sometimes translated into catastrophe .
wsj_1622	16	When market tremors start , it is crucial that as much information about transaction prices and the supply-demand curve buy and sell orders at various prices be made available to all , not just to market makers .
wsj_1622	17	Because of a lack of information and access , many investors -- including the very ones whose buying power could restore stability and damp volatility -- are forced to stand on the sidelines when they are most needed , because of their ignorance of important market information .
wsj_1622	18	To add aftershock-damping power to America 's markets , a modern , electronic trading system should be implemented that permits equal access to the trading arena and the information that would automatically accompany such access by investors -- particularly institutional investors .
wsj_1622	19	Contrary to some opinions , the trading activities of specialists and other market makers do not provide liquidity to the market as a whole .
wsj_1622	20	What market makers provide is immediacy , a very valuable service .
wsj_1622	21	Liquidity is not a service .
wsj_1622	22	It is a market attribute -- the ability to absorb selling orders without causing significant price changes in the absence of news .
wsj_1622	23	Market makers buy what investors wish to sell ; their business is reselling these unwanted positions as quickly as possible to other investors , and at a profit .
wsj_1622	24	As a result , while any one customer may purchase immediacy by selling to a market maker which is micro-liquidity for the investor , the market as a whole remains in the same circumstances it was before the transaction : The unwanted position is still an unwanted position ; only the identity of the seller has changed .
wsj_1622	25	In fact it can be argued that increasing capital commitments by market makers a result of some post-1987 crash studies also increases market volatility , since the more securities are held by market makers at any given time , the more selling pressure is overhanging the market .
wsj_1622	26	In an open electronic system , any investor wishing to pay for real-time access to the trading arena through a registered broker-dealer would be able to see the entire supply-demand curve buy and sell orders at each price entered by dealers and investors alike , and to enter and execute orders .
wsj_1622	27	Current quotations would reflect the combined financial judgment of all market participants -- not just those of intermediaries who become extremely risk-averse during times of crisis .
wsj_1622	28	Investors and professionals alike would compete on the level playing field Congress sought and called a `` national market system '' not yet achieved almost 15 years ago when it passed the Securities Reform Act of 1975 .
wsj_1622	29	Last Friday 's market gyrations did not result in severe `` aftershocks . ''
wsj_1622	30	Were we smart or just lucky ?
wsj_1622	31	I 'm not certain .
wsj_1622	32	But I am sure we need to maximize our `` earthquake '' protection by making certain that our market structures let investors add their mighty shock-damping power to our nation 's markets .
wsj_1622	33	Mr. Peake is chairman of his own consulting company in Englewood , N.J .
wsj_1625	0	THE PANHANDLER approaches , makes his pitch .
wsj_1625	1	It may be straightforward -- he wants money for food -- or incredibly convoluted ; his sister is at this very moment near death in Hoboken , he has lost his wallet and has only $ 1.22 in change to put toward a bus ticket costing $ 3.83 , and wo n't you give him the difference ?
wsj_1625	2	Well , how about a loan , he 'll take your name and address ...
wsj_1625	3	Figuring that their money would more likely go toward a bottle of Night Train Express , most people have little trouble saying no to propositions like this .
wsj_1625	4	But healthy skepticism vanishes when they are solicited by an organized charity to help fight cancer , famine , child abuse , or what have you .
wsj_1625	5	Most see little reason to doubt that their cash will go toward these noble goals .
wsj_1625	6	But will it ?
wsj_1625	7	In a distressing number of cases , no .
wsj_1625	8	In fact , the donors sometimes might be better off giving the money to the panhandler : at least he has no overhead , and he might even be telling the truth .
wsj_1625	9	Last year , more than $ 100 billion was donated to the nation 's 400,000 charities .
wsj_1625	10	While the vast bulk of it was indeed spent by reputable organizations on the good works it was raised for , it 's equally true that a sizable hunk was consumed in `` expenses '' claimed by other operators , including fraudulent expenses .
wsj_1625	11	In many cases the costs claimed were so high that only a dribble of cash was left for the purported beneficiaries .
wsj_1625	12	It 's impossible to say exactly how much of the total charity intake is devoured by stratospheric fund-raising costs , high-living operators , and downright fraud .
wsj_1625	13	But the problem clearly is widespread and persistent .
wsj_1625	14	State law enforcers can barely keep up with charity scams , and reports from watchdog groups such as the Council of Better Business Bureaus are not encouraging .
wsj_1625	15	The Philanthropic Advisory Service of the BBB reviews hundreds of new charities every year , measuring them against minimum standards for accountability ; for accuracy and honesty in solicitation ; and for percentage of funds actually going to work for which the charity was supposedly established .
wsj_1625	16	The Service figures at least half of the money taken in should be spent on program .
wsj_1625	17	Roughly a third of the charities reviewed flunk the test .
wsj_1625	18	Which , it should be added , does n't prevent the charities from raking in a lot of money anyway .
wsj_1625	19	Without a microscope and a subpoena , it 's often hard to sort out worthwhile causes from ripoffs if all you 've got to go on is the solicitation itself .
wsj_1625	20	On this basis , `` there 's no way the average person can know a good charity from a bad one , '' says David Ormstedt , an assistant attorney general in Connecticut .
wsj_1625	21	`` A lot of donors just get taken . ''
wsj_1625	22	Including those , he contends , who put about $ 1 million into the kitty for the Connecticut Association of Concerned Veterans and the Vietnam Veterans Service Center .
wsj_1625	23	The state has sued these charities in state court , complaining that much of the money was grossly misspent ; 82 % , says Mr. Ormstedt , went to fund raisers and most of the rest to the people who ran the charities and to their relatives -- for fur coats , trips to Florida , Lucullan restaurant tabs .
wsj_1625	24	The telephone number for the charity in Shelton , Conn. , has been disconnected , and the former officials could n't be located .
wsj_1625	25	Running a charity does cost money , but reputable organizations manage to get the lion 's share of donations out to where they are really needed .
wsj_1625	26	The Arthritis Foundation , the American Cancer Society and the United Way of America all say that they spend roughly 90 % of their income on programs , not overhead .
wsj_1625	27	With some other charities , however , it s the other way around .
wsj_1625	28	The fledgling National Children 's Cancer Society , for example , took in $ 2.5 million last year to finance bone-marrow transplants for children .
wsj_1625	29	By the time it paid its expenses it only had $ 120,000 left -- not enough to treat even one child .
wsj_1625	30	The state of Illinois is suing the charity for fraud in Chicago , along with Telesystems Marketing Inc. , its Houston-based fund raiser .
wsj_1625	31	The charity admits spending a lot on fund raising , but says that was necessary to establish a donor base it can tap at much lower cost in years to come .
wsj_1625	32	Michael Burns , president of Telesystems , says his concern has only benefited from the publicity surrounding the case , noting that three other charities have signed on as clients because they were impressed with the amount he raised for National Children 's .
wsj_1625	33	Meanwhile , a state court judge has allowed the charity to go on soliciting funds .
wsj_1625	34	Enforcers ca n't put charities out of business simply because they spend the lion 's share of their income on fund raising .
wsj_1625	35	State laws previously used as a yardstick minimum percentages of income -- usually half -- that had to be spent on the program rather than overhead , but these have been overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court .
wsj_1625	36	It has ruled that such laws might work to stifle fund raising , which would amount to limiting the charities ' first-amendment right to freedom of expression .
wsj_1625	37	This puts upon enforcers the burden of proving outright fraud or misrepresentation , and such actions have been brought against hundreds of charities recently .
wsj_1625	38	The attorney general 's office in Connecticut alone has put seven of them out of business over the past couple of years , and the enforcement drive is continuing there and elsewhere .
wsj_1625	39	In making cases , the authorities frequently zero in on alleged misrepresentations made by the charities ' fund raisers .
wsj_1625	40	Illinois , for instance , currently has under investigation 10 of the 30 companies drumming up funds for charities soliciting there .
wsj_1625	41	Enforcers pay special attention to operators using sweepstakes prizes as an additional inducement to give .
wsj_1625	42	Attorneys general in several states , including Illinois , are already suing Watson & Hughey Co. , an Alexandria , Va.-based outfit that they say has used deceptive sweepstakes ads to solicit donations for the American Heart Disease Foundation and the Cancer Fund of America .
wsj_1625	43	According to the Illinois attorney general 's suit , Watson & Hughey sent mailings indicating that recipients were guaranteed cash prizes , and could win up to an additional $ 1,000 on top of them , if they contributed as little as $ 7 .
wsj_1625	44	But the total value of the prizes was only $ 5,000 and most `` winners '' will receive just 10 cents , according to the attorney general 's office .
wsj_1625	45	The suit is still pending in Illinois state court .
wsj_1625	46	Watson & Hughey has denied the allegations in court ; officials decline to comment further .
wsj_1625	47	While they can target some of the most obvious miscreants , enforcers concede that they are only scratching the surface .
wsj_1625	48	There are so many cunning ploys used by so many dubious operators , they say , that it is probably impossible to stop them all .
wsj_1625	49	One maneuver : the `` public education '' gambit .
wsj_1625	50	The solicitation material indicates that donations will go toward a campaign alerting and informing the public about some health or other issue .
wsj_1625	51	What it does n't say is that the entire `` campaign '' may be the fund-raising letter itself .
wsj_1625	52	`` All too often this will merely be a statement on the solicitation such as , ` Do n't smoke ! ' or ` Wear suntan lotion , ' `` says William Webster , attorney general of Missouri .
wsj_1625	53	`` By putting these pithy statements on the solicitations , hundreds of thousands of dollars are claimed to have been spent on education to consumers when in fact this represents the costs of sending the newsletters . ''

wsj_1625	58	Many fly-by-night charities ride the coattails of the biggest , best-known and most reputable ones by adopting names similar to theirs .

wsj_1625	60	`` We ca n't police the many organizations that have sprung up in the last few years using part of our name .

wsj_1627	0	Italy 's industrial wholesale sales index rose 13.2 % in June from a year earlier , the state statistical institute Istat said .
wsj_1627	1	The June increase compared with a rise of 10.5 % in May from a year earlier .
wsj_1627	2	Domestic wholesale sales rose 11.9 % from a year earlier , while foreign sales jumped 17.3 % , Istat said .
wsj_1627	3	For the first six months , wholesale sales rose 12.3 % from the year before , reflecting to a 11.5 % jump in domestic sales and a 14.6 % boost in foreign sales .
wsj_1627	4	Sales of capital goods to foreign and domestic destinations increased 16.6 % in the January-June period from a year earlier .
wsj_1627	5	Sales of consumer goods rose 6.9 % in the same period , while sales of intermediate goods were up 13.8 % from a year ago .
wsj_1628	0	Senate Democrats favoring a cut in the capital-gains tax have decided , under pressure from their leaders , not to offer their own proposal , placing another obstacle in the path of President Bush 's legislative priority .
wsj_1628	1	A core group of six or so Democratic senators has been working behind the scenes to develop a proposal to reduce the tax on the gain from the sale of assets .
wsj_1628	2	The plan was complete except for finishing touches , and there was talk that it would be unveiled as early as yesterday .
wsj_1628	3	But Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell D. , Maine , a vigorous opponent of the capital-gains tax cut , called the group to meet with him Wednesday night and again yesterday .
wsj_1628	4	Sen. Mitchell urged them to desist .
wsj_1628	5	Afterward , leaders of the dissident Democrats relented , and said they would n't offer their own proposal as they had planned .
wsj_1628	6	The decision is a setback for President Bush , who needs the support of Democrats to pass the tax cut through the Democratic-controlled Senate .
wsj_1628	7	Having a proposal sponsored by Democrats would have given the president an advantage .
wsj_1628	8	Having only a Republican measure makes the task harder .
wsj_1628	9	Still , Sen. Bob Packwood R. , Ore. , the lead sponsor of the Republican capital-gains amendment , predicted that the tax cut would be enacted this year .
wsj_1628	10	He said a clear majority of senators back the tax reduction and that ultimately there would be enough senators to overcome any procedural hurdle the Democratic leadership might erect .
wsj_1628	11	But Sen. Mitchell , buoyed by his victory among fellow Democrats , strongly disagreed .
wsj_1628	12	Mr. Mitchell has been predicting that the president 's initiative would fail this year .
wsj_1628	13	Yesterday , in an interview , he added that the Democrats ' decision `` increases the likelihood that a capital-gains tax cut will not pass this year . ''
wsj_1628	14	Mr. Mitchell 's first victory came last week , when the Senate passed a deficit-reduction bill that did n't contain a capital-gains provision .
wsj_1628	15	That vote made it unlikely that a capital-gains tax cut would be included in the final bill , now being drafted by House and Senate negotiators .
wsj_1628	16	The House version of the bill does include the tax cut .
wsj_1628	17	Now Republican leaders are concentrating on attaching a capital-gains amendment to some other bill , perhaps a measure raising the federal borrowing limit or a second tax bill that would follow on the heels of the deficit-reduction legislation .
wsj_1628	18	To help lay the groundwork for that fight , President Bush plans early next week to meet at the White House with some 20 Democratic senators who favor cutting the capital-gains tax or are undecided on the issue .
wsj_1628	19	The president apparently will have only one bill to push , Sen. Packwood 's , and at least some of the dissident Democrats plan to support it .
wsj_1628	20	`` I may want to offer additional amendments to improve it when the bill comes to the floor , '' said Sen. David Boren D. , Okla. , a leader of those Democrats .
wsj_1628	21	The Packwood plan , as expected , would allow individuals to exclude from income 5 % of the gain from the sale of a capital asset held for more than one year .
wsj_1628	22	The exclusion would rise five percentage points for each year the asset was held , until it reached a maximum of 35 % after seven years .
wsj_1628	23	The exclusion would apply to assets sold after Oct. 1 .
wsj_1628	24	As an alternative , taxpayers could chose to reduce their gains by an inflation index .
wsj_1628	25	For corporations , the top tax rate on the sale of assets held for more than three years would be cut to 33 % from the current top rate of 34 % .
wsj_1628	26	That rate would gradually decline to as little as 29 % for corporate assets held for 15 years .
wsj_1628	27	The Packwood plan also would include a proposal , designed by Sen. William Roth R. , Del. , that would create new tax benefits for individual retirement accounts .
wsj_1628	28	The Roth plan would create a new , non-deductible IRA from which money could be withdrawn tax-free not only for retirement , but also for the purchase of a first home , education expenses and medical expenses .
wsj_1628	29	Current IRAs could be rolled over into the new IRAs , but would be subject to tax though no penalty .
wsj_1630	0	Chase Manhattan Corp. , after trying unsuccessfully to sell its interest in its lower Manhattan operations building , has exercised its option to purchase the 50-story office tower .
wsj_1630	1	Chase had purchased an option to buy the building at One New York Plaza for an undisclosed sum from the late Sol Atlas as part of its original lease in 1970 .
wsj_1630	2	The current transaction cost the bank approximately $ 140 million .
wsj_1630	3	Of that amount , $ 20 million was payment for the land underneath the building and the rest was for the building itself .
wsj_1630	4	The building houses about 4,500 Chase workers , most of whom will be moved to downtown Brooklyn after the bank 's new back office center is completed in 1993 .
wsj_1630	5	The move is part of Chase 's strategy to consolidate its back offices under one roof .
wsj_1630	6	The headquarters is located a few blocks away at 1 Chase Manhattan Plaza .
wsj_1630	7	As part of its decision to leave the building , Chase tried to sell its interest , along with the Atlas estate 's interest , shortly after the October 1987 stock market crash .
wsj_1630	8	Chase Senior Vice President George Scandalios said the bank decided to exercise its option after bids fell short of expectations .
wsj_1630	9	He said Chase and the Atlas estate were looking to sell the entire building for $ 400 million to $ 475 million , but did n't get an offer for more than $ 375 million .
wsj_1630	10	As the building 's new owner , Chase will have its work cut out for it .
wsj_1630	11	Chase is vacating 1.1 million square feet of space , and Salomon Brothers Inc. , whose headquarters is in the building , also plans to move shortly .
wsj_1630	12	In addition , another major building tenant , Thomson McKinnon Inc. 's Thomson McKinnon Securities , likely will vacate the premises as part of its liquidation .
wsj_1630	13	New York real estate brokerage Edward S. Gordon Co. will have the difficult task of finding new tenants .
wsj_1630	14	Even with its striking views of the New York harbor , the building is considered antiquated by modern office standards .
wsj_1630	15	And Chase will have to spend approximately $ 50 million to remove asbestos from the premises .
wsj_1632	0	I was amused to read your recent news stories on the banking industry 's reserve additions and concomitant threats to cease making new loans to less-developed countries .
wsj_1632	1	If the whole story were told , it would read something like this :
wsj_1632	2	-- During the 1970s the commercial banks lured the country loan business away from the bond markets where the discipline of a prospectus and `` Use of Proceeds '' confirmation allowed lenders to audit expenditures of old loans before new loans were made .
wsj_1632	3	-- The reward for that reckless lending was high reported earnings and management bonuses ; the price , a sea of bad loans .
wsj_1632	4	-- For the past several years , the banks , lacking a private navy to enforce their interests , have been pressuring the U.S. Treasury to underwrite their bad LDC credits .
wsj_1632	5	-- The Treasury wisely has refused , but has concluded that indirect credit support through various multinational agencies should be made available for a price : either debt reduction or debt-service reduction or new loans the Brady Plan .
wsj_1632	6	-- The banks will threaten not to make further loans , but in truth , lacking the capital to write off their mistakes or to build a navy , they have no alternative but to go along .
wsj_1633	0	Gillette Co. elected Warren E. Buffett , chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. , to its board , increasing the number of directors to 12 from 11 .
wsj_1633	1	Berkshire Hathaway earlier this year bought $ 600 million of preferred stock in Gillette that is convertible into an 11 % stake , and Gillette said at the time that Mr. Buffett would be added to the board .
wsj_1633	2	Separately , Gillette said its third-quarter earnings rose 2 % to $ 65.2 million , or 57 cents a share , from $ 63.9 million , or 57 cents a share , in the year-earlier period ; per-share earnings remained flat despite an increase in net income in part because the company paid a $ 10.4 million dividend on the new preferred stock in the period .
wsj_1633	3	Sales rose 9 % to $ 921.6 million from $ 845.7 million , with sales of the company 's international/diversified operations `` well above '' the year earlier-period .
wsj_1633	4	For the nine months , Gillette 's net income declined 1 % to $ 205.3 million , or $ 2.02 a share , from $ 207 million , or $ 1.82 a share , in the 1988 period .
wsj_1633	5	Sales rose 6 % to $ 2.77 billion from $ 2.61 billion .
wsj_1633	6	In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange , the company closed yesterday at $ 45.50 a share , up 25 cents .
wsj_1636	0	IF YOU FORCE financial planners to sum up their most important advice in a single sentence , it would probably be a one-word sentence : Diversify .
wsj_1636	1	Judging by a poll of Wall Street Journal readers conducted this summer by Erdos & Morgan Inc. , serious investors have taken that advice to heart .
wsj_1636	2	Nearly 1,000 investors responded to the Journal 's poll , providing an in-depth look at their portfolios .
wsj_1636	3	Those portfolios are remarkably diversified .
wsj_1636	4	By spreading their wealth among several investment alternatives , the respondents have protected themselves against squalls in any one area , be it stocks , bonds or real estate .
wsj_1636	5	For example , about 88 % of Journal readers owned stock down slightly from 91 % in a similar poll last year .
wsj_1636	6	But only 17.5 % said they had more than half their money in the stock market .
wsj_1636	7	Similarly , 57 % of respondents own shares in a money-market mutual fund , and 33 % own municipal bonds .
wsj_1636	8	But only 6 % to 7 % of the investors were committing more than half their funds to either of those alternatives .
wsj_1636	9	The poll , conducted Aug. 7-28 , also provides a glimpse into the thinking of serious investors on a variety of other topics .
wsj_1636	10	It found them in a cautious , but not downbeat , mood .
wsj_1636	11	Of 1,500 people sent a questionnaire , 951 replied .
wsj_1636	12	The response rate , more than 63 % , allows the results to be interpreted with a high degree of confidence .
wsj_1636	13	The results ca n't be extrapolated to all investors , though .
wsj_1636	14	Journal readers are relatively affluent , with a median household income of between $ 75,000 and $ 99,000 .
wsj_1636	15	Nearly half of the respondents 47 % said their investment portfolio was worth $ 250,000 or more , and 17 % said it was worth $ 1 million or more .
wsj_1636	16	The respondents were mildly optimistic about the economy and investment markets , but their collective judgments were a notch more sober than they were a year ago .
wsj_1636	17	For example , 12 % of this year 's respondents said they expect a recession within 12 months .
wsj_1636	18	Last year , only 8 % were expecting a recession .
wsj_1636	19	An additional 56 % of this year 's respondents expect the economy to slow down during the next 12 months .
wsj_1636	20	Only 42 % of last year 's respondents anticipated slowing growth .
wsj_1636	21	Apparently , the respondents do n't think that an economic slowdown would harm the major investment markets very much .
wsj_1636	22	A slim majority 51 % think stock prices will be higher in August 1990 than they were in August 1989 .
wsj_1636	23	Their verdict on real estate is almost the same .
wsj_1636	24	Some 50 % expect real estate in their local area to increase in value over the next 12 months .
wsj_1636	25	By contrast , only 32 % expect an increase in the price of gold .
wsj_1636	26	Since gold tends to soar when inflation is high , that finding suggests that people believe inflation remains under control .
wsj_1636	27	Even though only 12 % actually predicted a recession , many respondents were taking a better-safe-than sorry investment stance .
wsj_1636	28	Nearly a third said they have made some portfolio changes to anticipate a possible recession .
wsj_1636	29	For the most part , the changes were `` slight . ''
wsj_1636	30	The two-thirds who have n't tried to make their portfolios more recession-resistant were split about evenly between investors who `` do n't believe in trying to predict the markets '' about 31 % and investors who `` do n't expect a recession '' about 15 % or are `` unsure if and when a recession might come '' about 22 % .
wsj_1636	31	A buy-and-hold approach to stocks continues to be the rule among respondents .
wsj_1636	32	Most own two to 10 stocks , and buy or sell no more than three times a year .
wsj_1636	33	Some 71 % had bought some stock in the past year ; only 57 % had sold any .
wsj_1636	34	But the lurking shadow of 1987 's stock-market crash still seems dark .
wsj_1636	35	About 33 % considered another crash `` likely , '' while about 63 % said one is `` unlikely . ''
wsj_1636	36	Those percentages hardly changed from the previous year 's poll .
wsj_1636	37	And the respondents ' commitment to the stock market remains somewhat lighter than usual .
wsj_1636	38	About 60 % of them said they would `` ordinarily '' have at least 25 % of their money in stocks .
wsj_1636	39	But as of August , only 50 % actually had stock-market investments of that size .
wsj_1636	40	Most stock-market indexes were hitting all-time highs at around the time of the poll .
wsj_1636	41	But it appears that many Journal readers were taking that news as a sign to be cautious , rather than a signal to jump on the bandwagon .

wsj_1641	0	The University of Toronto stepped deeper into the contest for Connaught BioSciences Inc. by reaching an unusual agreement with Ciba-Geigy Ltd. and Chiron Corp .
wsj_1641	1	The University said the two companies agreed to spend 25 million Canadian dollars $ 21.3 million over 10 years on research at Canadian universities if they are successful in acquiring the vaccine maker .
wsj_1641	2	It said $ 10 million would go to the University of Toronto .
wsj_1641	3	Ciba-Geigy and Chiron have made a joint bid of C$ 866 million for Connaught , and Institut Merieux S.A. of France has made a rival bid of C$ 942 million .
wsj_1641	4	The University is seeking an injunction against the Merieux bid , arguing that Connaught 's predecessor company agreed in 1972 that Connaught 's ownership would n't be transferred to foreigners .
wsj_1641	5	The university implied that it would drop its opposition to foreign ownership if Ciba-Geigy and Chiron are successful with their lower bid .
wsj_1641	6	It said the new agreement would `` replace '' the old one that forms the basis of its suit against the Merieux takeover .
wsj_1641	7	`` Notwithstanding foreign ownership of Connaught , this accord would enhance research and development in Canada , '' said James Keffer , the university 's vice president of research .

wsj_1644	0	Investors who received Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. 's latest stock commentary may be left with blank expressions .
wsj_1644	1	The first 10 pages of the 76-page Weekly Portfolio Perspective are completely blank , except for the page numbers .
wsj_1644	2	Rather than printing devils , Shearson puts all the blame on the unpredictable stock market .
wsj_1644	3	The plunge made Shearson 's market commentary instantly out of date .
wsj_1644	4	In fact , last Friday 's 190.58-point tumble in the stock market caught many people and businesses by surprise , not the least of them brokerage firms such as Shearson that print their weekly market commentaries on Fridays for dissemination the following week .
wsj_1644	5	Shearson , a 62%-owned unit of American Express Co. , did n't have enough time to update its market commentary so , `` We decided to kill our strategy pieces , '' says Jack Rivkin , the head of Shearson 's research department .
wsj_1644	6	The first thought some investors had was that a red-faced Shearson must have been wildly bullish on stocks in its original commentary , and that 's why it purged its pages .
wsj_1644	7	Investors recalled that Shearson last week had been advising that `` the market is still exhibiting all the signs of a further advance . ''
wsj_1644	8	Many other brokerage firms had similarly bullish views .
wsj_1644	9	But Mr. Rivkin insists that the 10 pages were n't pulled because they were too bullish .
wsj_1644	10	Instead , he says , `` they were cautious , and that was n't the message we wanted to deliver '' on Monday .
wsj_1644	11	As Mr. Rivkin explains it , `` We were raising some caution flags about rate rises in Europe and concerns about the LBO market .
wsj_1644	12	And by late Friday afternoon , actually after the close , we decided that was the wrong tone to take .
wsj_1644	13	With the market down , we wanted to tell people to put their orders in on the opening . ''
wsj_1644	14	Both before and after the Friday plunge , Shearson has maintained a recommended portfolio weighting of 65 % stocks , 20 % bonds and 15 % cash .
wsj_1645	0	Sheldon B. Lubar , chairman of Lubar & Co. , and John L. Murray , chairman of Universal Foods Corp. , were elected to the board of this engine maker .

wsj_1646	0	China 's slide toward recession is beginning to look like a free fall .
wsj_1646	1	In a report on China 's foundering economy , the official State Statistical Bureau disclosed that industrial output last month rose 0.9 % from a year earlier - the lowest growth rate in a decade for September .
wsj_1646	2	Retail sales are plummeting , while consumer prices still are rising .
wsj_1646	3	Chinese and foreign economists now predict prolonged stagflation : low growth and high inflation .
wsj_1646	4	`` The economy is crashing hard , '' says an Asian economist in Beijing .
wsj_1646	5	`` The slowdown is taking hold a lot more quickly and devastatingly than anyone had expected . ''
wsj_1646	6	A lengthy recession , if it materializes , would drain state coffers and create severe hardships for urban workers .
wsj_1646	7	Experts predict the coming year will be characterized by flat or negative industrial growth , rising unemployment and a widening budget deficit .
wsj_1646	8	Unless the government suddenly reverses course , wages for most workers wo n't keep pace with inflation , creating a potential source of urban unrest .
wsj_1646	9	The economy 's slowdown is due only partly to the austerity program launched in September 1988 to cool an overheated economy and tame inflation .
wsj_1646	10	Industrial output surged 21 % in 1988 , while inflation peaked last February at nearly 30 % . )
wsj_1646	11	The slowdown also results from chronic energy and raw-materials shortages that force many factories to restrict operations to two or three days a week .
wsj_1646	12	In Western , market-driven countries , recessions often have a bright side : prodding the economy to greater efficiency .
wsj_1646	13	In China , however , there is n't likely to be any silver lining because the economy remains guided primarily by the state .
wsj_1646	14	Instead , China is likely to shell out ever-greater subsidies to its coddled state-run enterprises , which ate up $ 18 billion in bailouts last year .
wsj_1646	15	Nor are any of these inefficient monoliths likely to be allowed to go bankrupt .
wsj_1646	16	Rather , the brunt of the slowdown will be felt in the fast-growing private and semi-private `` township '' enterprises , which have fallen into disfavor as China 's leaders re-emphasize an orthodox Marxist preference for public ownership .
wsj_1646	17	`` When the going gets rough , China penalizes the efficient and rewards the incompetent , '' says a Western economist .
wsj_1646	18	Reports of an economy near recession come as officials prepare a major Communist Party plenum for sometime in the next few weeks .
wsj_1646	19	The meeting is expected to call for heightened austerity for two years .
wsj_1646	20	But with industrial growth stagnant and inflation showing signs of easing , some voices may call for measures to pump new life into the economy .
wsj_1646	21	Some analysts believe China soon will begin relaxing economic controls , particularly by loosening credit .
wsj_1646	22	That would benefit Chinese enterprises as well as Sino-foreign joint ventures , both of which have been plagued by shortages of working capital .
wsj_1646	23	A dangerous buildup this year of billions of dollars in inter-company debts threatens , if unchecked , to bring the economy to a collapse .
wsj_1646	24	One sign of a possible easing of credit policy was the decision this week of People 's Bank of China , the central bank , to allocate $ 5.4 billion in short-term loans to pay farmers for the autumn harvest , the official China Daily reported .
wsj_1646	25	But while pumping more money into the economy would bring relief to many industries , it also runs the risk of triggering another period of runaway growth and steep inflation .
wsj_1646	26	The cycle has been repeated several times since China began reforming its planned economy in 1979 .
wsj_1646	27	And , because China 's leaders have abandoned plans to drastically reform the economy , it is likely to continue , analysts say .
wsj_1646	28	The statistical bureau 's report , cited in China Daily , notes that industrial output in September totaled $ 29.4 billion , a rise of just 0.9 % from a year earlier .
wsj_1646	29	Output declined in several provinces , including Jiangsu and Zhejiang , two key coastal areas , and Sichuan , the nation 's agricultural breadbasket .
wsj_1646	30	Production in Shanghai , China 's industrial powerhouse and the largest source of tax revenue for the central government , fell 1.8 % for the month .
wsj_1646	31	Nationwide , output of light industrial products declined 1.8 % -- `` the first decline in 10 years , '' a bureau spokesman told China Daily .
wsj_1646	32	In an unusually direct statement , the bureau spokesman recommended that state banks extend more credit to shopkeepers so that they can purchase manufacturers ' goods .
wsj_1646	33	`` This will prevent a slide in industrial production , which will otherwise cause new panic buyings , '' the spokesman said .
wsj_1648	0	Lufthansa AG said passenger volume climbed 5.2 % for the first nine months of 1989 to 15.3 million passengers from 14.5 million passengers in the year-earlier period .
wsj_1648	1	The West German national air carrier said cargo volume jumped 12 % to 638,000 metric tons from 569,000 tons a year ago .
wsj_1648	2	Load factor , or percentage of seats filled , climbed to 67.1 % from 66.6 % , even though the number of flights rose 6.9 % to 215,845 in the first-three quarters .
wsj_1648	3	From January through September , the distance flown by Lufthansa airplanes rose 5.6 % to 266.2 million kilometers from a year earlier , the company added .
wsj_1651	0	Bell Atlantic Corp. and Southern New England Telecommunications posted strong profit gains for the third quarter , while Nynex Corp. , Pacific Telesis Group and U S West Inc. reported earnings declines for the period .
wsj_1651	1	Rate settlements in Minnesota and Colorado depressed U S West 's third-quarter profit .
wsj_1651	2	Denver-based U S West said net income dropped 8.9 % , noting that the year-ago quarter included the sale of a building by its BetaWest Properties unit .
wsj_1651	3	Revenue dropped 4.3 % to $ 2.3 billion from $ 2.4 billion , reflecting declines in its consumer-telephone sector , long-distance carrier business and diversified division .
wsj_1651	4	Revenue from business-telephone operations grew 3.3 % to $ 618.9 million from $ 599.4 million a year ago .
wsj_1651	5	New telephone lines posted healthy growth .
wsj_1651	6	Overall they increased 2.8 % to 12.1 million , putting U S West over the 12 million mark for the first time .
wsj_1651	7	Business lines increased 3.7 % to 3.3 million .
wsj_1651	8	`` On a truly comparable basis , we 've seen modest earnings growth this year from the operations of our company , '' said Jack MacAllister , chairman and chief executive officer .
wsj_1651	9	`` The major negative factor was the cumulative impact of regulatory activity over the past two years . ''
wsj_1651	10	He said the company expects to be `` on target '' with analysts ' projections by year end but conceded that the fourth quarter represents `` a significant challenge . ''
wsj_1651	11	Expenses in the quarter dropped 11.2 % to $ 664.3 million from $ 747.7 million a year ago .
wsj_1651	12	Yesterday , U S West shares rose 75 cents to close at $ 71.25 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading .
wsj_1651	13	Philadelphia-based Bell Atlantic said net rose 6.5 % , aided by strong growth in the network-services business and an increase in the number of new telephone lines .
wsj_1651	14	Revenue jumped 5.6 % to $ 2.9 billion from $ 2.8 billion in the year-ago quarter .
wsj_1651	15	Revenue from financial and real-estate services jumped 23 % to $ 177.4 million from $ 144.1 million a year ago .
wsj_1651	16	Network-access revenue from long-distance telephone companies increased 6.4 % to $ 618.6 million .
wsj_1651	17	Bell Atlantic added 148,000 new telephone lines in the quarter for a total of 16.9 million .
wsj_1651	18	The company said per-share earnings were slightly reduced by the sale of 4.1 million shares of treasury stock to the company 's newly formed Employee Stock Ownership Plans .
wsj_1651	19	In composite trading on the Big Board , Bell Atlantic closed at $ 100.625 , up $ 1.50 a share .
wsj_1651	20	At Nynex , net slumped 14.8 % , primarily because of a continuing strike by 60,000 employees , lower-than-expected profit at its New York Telephone unit and significantly higher taxes and costs .
wsj_1651	21	State and local taxes increased to $ 131.3 million from $ 99.1 million a year ago .
wsj_1651	22	Nynex said expenses rose 4.5 % to $ 2.73 billion from $ 2.61 billion , a $ 119 million increase .
wsj_1651	23	Most of the higher costs were associated with acquisitions and growth in nonregulated business units , it added .
wsj_1651	24	`` Our net income is n't where we would want it to be at this point , '' said William C. Ferguson , chairman and chief executive officer .
wsj_1651	25	`` This deviation from our past growth patterns is caused largely by lower earnings at New York Telephone . ''
wsj_1651	26	Mr. Ferguson said a continued softness in New York City area 's economy and increased competition , particularly in the private-line market , took a heavy toll on earnings .
wsj_1651	27	The three-month-old strike at Nynex seriously hurt the installation of new telephone lines in the quarter .
wsj_1651	28	Nynex said access lines in service at the end of the quarter were off 18,000 from the previous quarter , which reported an increase of 160,000 new access lines .
wsj_1651	29	Revenue rose to $ 3.31 billion from $ 3.18 billion , mostly from acquisition of AGS Computers and robust non-regulated businesses .
wsj_1651	30	In Big Board composite trading yesterday , Nynex common closed at $ 81.125 , up $ 1.625 .
wsj_1651	31	Southern New England Telecommunications , which bolstered its marketing efforts for telephone and non-telephone subsidiaries , reported that net increased 8.1 % .
wsj_1651	32	Walter H. Monteith Jr. , SNET chairman and chief executive officer , said : `` Innovative marketing of our products and services contributed to increase revenue . ''
wsj_1651	33	Revenue and sales increased 7.5 % to $ 423.9 million from $ 394.4 million a year earlier .
wsj_1651	34	Yellow pages advertising sales rose 11.8 % to $ 41.2 million .
wsj_1651	35	Cost and expenses for the quarter , excluding interest , increased 6.1 % to $ 333.3 million from $ 314 million the year before .
wsj_1651	36	SNET common rose $ 1.25 to $ 85.50 a share yesterday in composite trading on the Big Board .
wsj_1651	37	San Francisco-based Pacific Telesis said net declined 12.6 % , primarily because of regulatory action .
wsj_1651	38	Revenue was about flat at $ 2.4 billion .
wsj_1651	39	Revenue was reduced $ 33 million by three extraordinary items : a California Public Utilities Commission refund for an American Telephone & Telegraph Co. billing adjustment ; a provision for productivity sharing to be paid to customers in 1990 and a one-time accrual for a toll settlement with long-distance telephone companies .
wsj_1651	40	Excluding the one-time charges , the company would have posted earnings of $ 298 million , or 73 cents a share .
wsj_1651	41	The company also was hurt by a $ 289 million rate reduction that went into effect in 1989 .
wsj_1651	42	`` This is a good quarter for us in terms of our business fundamentals , '' said Sam Ginn , chairman and chief executive officer .
wsj_1651	43	Pacific Telesis said new telephone lines increased 4.5 % for a total of about $ 13.5 million for the quarter ; toll calls increased 9.6 % to 807 million and minutes of telephone usage increased to 9.9 billion .
wsj_1651	44	In Big Board composite trading yesterday , Pacific Telesis common closed at $ 45.50 , up 87.5 cents .
wsj_1651	45	a - Includes a one-time gain of $ 88.7 million from a commonstock sale by U S West 's U S West New Vector Group .
wsj_1651	46	b - Includes a $ 41.3 million gain on the sale of FiberCom .
wsj_1652	0	Amoco Corp. said third-quarter net income plunged 39 % to $ 336 million , or 65 cents a share , as gasoline refining and marketing profits lagged substantially behind last year 's record level .
wsj_1652	1	A charge of $ 80 million related to projected environmental costs in its refining and marketing operations further depressed results .
wsj_1652	2	A spokesman said Amoco completed an environmental analysis last quarter but that no single clean-up project was responsible .
wsj_1652	3	In the 1988 third quarter , the Chicago-based oil company earned $ 552 million , or $ 1.07 a share .
wsj_1652	4	Revenue in the latest quarter rose 12 % to $ 6.6 billion from $ 5.91 billion .
wsj_1652	5	Aside from the special charge , Amoco 's results were in line with Wall Street estimates .
wsj_1652	6	The company 's stock ended at $ 48.375 , up 25 cents in New York Stock Exchange composite trading .
wsj_1652	7	Amoco is the first major oil company to report third-quarter results .
wsj_1652	8	Analysts expect others to show a similar pattern .
wsj_1652	9	Generally in the quarter , overproduction of gasoline and higher crude oil prices pressured profitability .
wsj_1652	10	The industry 's chemical profits also declined because excess capacity has depressed prices .
wsj_1652	11	Gasoline margins may rebound this quarter , some industry officials say , but they believe chemical margins could worsen .
wsj_1652	12	American Petrofina Inc. , a Dallas-based integrated oil company , yesterday said its third-quarter earnings declined by more than half .
wsj_1652	13	Fina blamed lower chemical prices , reduced gasoline margins and refinery maintenance shutdowns .
wsj_1652	14	It said net income dropped to $ 15.1 million , or 98 cents a share , from $ 35.2 million , or $ 2.66 a share .
wsj_1652	15	Sales rose 2.2 % to $ 711.9 million from $ 696.1 million .
wsj_1652	16	Amoco 's refining and marketing profit in the quarter fell to $ 134 million from $ 319 million .
wsj_1652	17	Chemical earnings declined by one-third to $ 120 million last year 's robust levels .
wsj_1652	18	Amoco 's domestic oil and natural gas operations recorded a profit of $ 104 million in the quarter compared with a loss of $ 5 million , `` primarily on the strength of higher crude oil prices , '' said Chairman Richard M. Morrow .
wsj_1652	19	Amoco also sharply boosted natural-gas output , part of it from properties acquired from Tenneco Inc. last year .
wsj_1652	20	But foreign exploration and production earnings fell sharply , to $ 12 million from $ 95 million .
wsj_1652	21	Higher oil prices were n't enough to offset a roughly $ 20 million charge related to a 10 % reduction in Amoco 's Canadian work force as well as increased exploration expenses .
wsj_1652	22	For the nine months , Amoco said that net income fell to $ 1.29 billion from $ 1.69 billion but if unusual items are excluded , operations produced essentially flat results .
wsj_1652	23	Revenue rose 12 % to $ 19.93 billion from $ 17.73 billion .
wsj_1653	0	James F. Gero , former chairman and chief executive officer of Varo Inc. , and Richard J. Hatchett III , a Dallas investment banker , were elected directors of this medical-products concern , boosting the board to seven members .
wsj_1655	0	The Spanish author Camilo Jose Cela won the Nobel Prize for literature yesterday , a surprising choice , but given the Swedish Academy 's past perversities , hardly the most undeserved and ridiculous accolade handed out by the awarding committee .
wsj_1655	1	In Spain , anyway , the 73-year-old Mr. Cela enjoys some renown for the novels and travel books he wrote during the parched Franco years , the everyday poverty and stagnant atmosphere of which he described in brutally direct , vivid prose , beginning with `` The Family of Pascal Duarte '' 1942 .
wsj_1655	2	Unlike other writers who either battled the fascists during the Civil War , or left Spain when Franco triumphed , Mr. Cela fought briefly on the general 's side , no doubt earning with his war wound some forbearance when he went on to depict a country with a high population of vagabonds , murderers and rural idiots trudging aimlessly through a dried-out land .
wsj_1655	3	Still , it was in Argentine editions that his countrymen first read his story of Pascal Duarte , a field worker who stabbed his mother to death and has no regrets as he awaits his end in a prison cell : `` Fate directs some men down the flower-bordered path , and others down the road bordered with thistles and prickly pears .
wsj_1655	4	The lucky ones gaze out at life with serene eyes and smile with a face of innocence at their perfumed happiness .
wsj_1655	5	The others endure the hot sun of the plains and scowl like cornered wild beasts . ''
wsj_1655	6	Mr. Cela himself was one of the lucky ones , his fortunes steadily increasing over the decades he spent putting out some 70 travelogues , novels , short story collections and poetry .
wsj_1655	7	These days , he is as known for his flamboyant tastes and the youthful muse who shares his life as he is for his books .
wsj_1655	8	The man who wore out his shoes wandering around Guadalajara in 1958 , describing in his travel book `` Viaje a la Alcarria '' how he scrounged for food and stayed in squalid inns , now tours Spain in a Rolls-Royce .
wsj_1655	9	Of his 10 novels , `` The Hive '' 1951 , full of sharp vignettes of Madrid life and centered on a cafe run by Dona Rosa , a foul-mouthed , broad-based woman with blackened little teeth encrusted in filth , used to be available in English , translated by J.M. Cohen and published by Ecco Press , which now no doubt regrets relinquishing its copyright .
wsj_1655	10	Here is an excerpt :
wsj_1655	11	The lonely woman walks on in the direction of the Plaza de Alonso Martinez .
wsj_1655	12	Two men have a conversation behind one of the windows of the cafe on the corner of the boulevard .
wsj_1655	13	Both are young , one twenty odd , the other thirty odd .
wsj_1655	14	The older one looks like a member of the jury for a literary award , the younger one looks like a novelist .
wsj_1655	15	It is evident that their conversation runs more or less on the following lines : `` I 've submitted the manuscript of my novel under the title ` Teresa de Cepeda , ' and in it I 've treated a few neglected aspects of that eternal problem which ... ''
wsj_1655	16	`` Oh , yes .
wsj_1655	17	Will you pour me a drop of water , if you do n't mind ? ''
wsj_1655	18	I 've revised it several times and I think I may say with pride that there is not a single discordant word in the whole text . ''
wsj_1655	19	`` How interesting . ''
wsj_1655	20	`` I think so .
wsj_1655	21	I do n't know the quality of the works my colleagues have sent in , but in any case I feel confident that good sense and honest judgment ... ''
wsj_1655	22	`` Rest assured , we proceed with exemplary fairness . ''
wsj_1655	23	`` I do n't doubt it for a moment .
wsj_1655	24	It does not matter if one is defeated , provided the work that gets the award has unmistakable qualities .
wsj_1655	25	What 's so discouraging is ... ''
wsj_1655	26	In passing the window , Senorita Elvira gives them a smile -- simply out of habit .
wsj_1656	0	Ashland Oil Inc. said it will take after-tax charges of $ 78 million , or $ 1.40 a share , in its fiscal fourth quarter , ended Sept. 30 .
wsj_1656	1	Because of the charge , Ashland expects to report a loss for the fourth quarter and `` significantly lower results '' for fiscal 1989 .
wsj_1656	2	The oil refiner said it will report fiscal fourth quarter and 1989 results next week .
wsj_1656	3	The company earned $ 66 million , or $ 1.19 a share , on revenue of $ 2.1 billion in the year-ago fourth quarter .
wsj_1656	4	For fiscal 1988 , Ashland had net of $ 224 million , or $ 4.01 a share , on revenue of $ 7.8 billion .
wsj_1656	5	Both revenue figures exclude excise taxes .
wsj_1656	6	The charges consist of : a $ 25 million after-tax charge to cover cost overruns in Ashland 's Riley Consolidated subsidiary ; a previously announced $ 38 million after-tax charge resulting from a $ 325 million settlement with National Iranian Oil Co. and a $ 15 million after-tax charge from the previously announced sale of its Ashland Technology Corp. subsidiary .
wsj_1656	7	Ashland expects that sale to be complete next year .
wsj_1656	8	The charge for the Riley subsidiary is for expected costs to correct problems with certain bed boilers built for utilities .
wsj_1656	9	The charge will be added to $ 20 million in reserves established a year ago to cover the cost overruns .
wsj_1658	0	Holiday Corp. said net income jumped 89 % , partly on the strength of record operating income in its gaming division .
wsj_1658	1	Separately , the hotel and gambling giant said it was proceeding with plans to make a tender offer and solicit consents with respect to approximately $ 1.4 billion of its publicly traded debt .
wsj_1658	2	That debt is part of the $ 2.1 billion of Holiday debt that Bass PLC of Britain said it would retire or assume when it agreed to buy the Holiday Inn business in August .
wsj_1658	3	Holiday said third-quarter earnings rose to $ 39.8 million , or $ 1.53 a share , from $ 21 million , or 84 cents a share , a year earlier .
wsj_1658	4	Results for the quarter included $ 19.2 million in pretax gains from property transactions , including the sale of one Embassy Suites hotel , and $ 3.5 million of nonrecurring costs associated with the acquisition of the Holiday Inn business by Bass .
wsj_1658	5	Holiday said operating income related to gaming increased 4.5 % to a record $ 61.4 million from $ 58.8 million a year earlier .
wsj_1658	6	The jump reflected record results in Las Vegas , Nev. , and Atlantic City , N.J. , as well as a full quarter 's results from Harrah 's Del Rio in Laughlin , Nev .
wsj_1658	7	Third-quarter revenue rose 2.7 % to $ 433.5 million from $ 422.1 million .
wsj_1658	8	For the nine months , earnings fell 2.9 % to $ 99.1 million , or $ 3.86 a share , from $ 102.1 million , or $ 4.10 a share , a year earlier .
wsj_1658	9	Revenue dropped 1.6 % to $ 1.21 billion from $ 1.23 billion .
wsj_1658	10	The tender offer and consent solicitation will be made to debtholders in December .
wsj_1658	11	In effect , Holiday is asking holders for permission for Bass to buy their debt .
wsj_1658	12	Holiday said Salomon Brothers Inc. has been retained to act as the dealer-manager and financial adviser in connection with the offer and solicitation .
wsj_1658	13	The debt issues involved and the proposed consent fees and cash tender offer prices expressed per $ 1,000 of principal amount are as follows : 10 1/2 % senior notes due 1994 at 101 % ; 11 % subordinated debt due 1999 at 102 % ; 9 3/8 % notes due 1993 at 100 % ; and 8 3/8 % notes due 1996 at 95.25 % .
wsj_1658	14	Holiday said its 15 % notes due 1992 also will be included in the tender offer and consent solicitation at a price to be determined by Holiday prior to the commencement of the offer .
wsj_1659	0	The television units of Paramount Communications Inc. and MCA Inc. are exploring the possibility of offering prime-time programming to independent stations two nights a week , industry executives say .
wsj_1659	1	Although such a venture would n't match the `` fourth network '' created by News Corp. 's Fox Broadcasting Co. , MCA and Paramount may have similar ambitions .
wsj_1659	2	Fox , which also owns six TV stations , provides programs three nights a week to those and other affiliates .
wsj_1659	3	Paramount Domestic TV and MCA TV formed a joint venture last month , named Premier Advertiser Sales , to sell advertising in programs syndicated by both companies , such as `` Star Trek : the Next Generation , '' `` Charles in Charge '' and `` Friday the 13th : the Series . ''
wsj_1659	4	A spokeswoman for Paramount said the company does n't comment on speculation .
wsj_1659	5	Calls to Shelly Schwab , president of MCA TV , were n't returned .
wsj_1659	6	The two companies , like Fox , already have their own TV stations .
wsj_1659	7	MCA owns WWOR in New York and Paramount last month agreed to purchase a 79 % stake in the TVX Broadcast Group from Salomon Inc. in a deal valued at $ 140 million .
wsj_1659	8	TVX owns five stations , including WTXF , a Fox affiliate , in Philadelphia .
wsj_1659	9	One broadcasting executive familiar with the project said the co-venture would target stations affiliated with Fox because Fox has the desirable independent stations in most of the key cities .
wsj_1659	10	Currently , Fox supplies programs on Saturdays , Sundays and Mondays , although the company plans to expand to other weeknights .
wsj_1659	11	Jamie Kellner , president of Fox Broadcasting , said , `` We believe the partnership of Fox , its affiliates and advertisers is succeeding and will continue to grow . ''
wsj_1659	12	Another Fox official , who declined to be identified , said Fox was n't pleased by the possible Paramount-MCA venture into prime-time programming .
wsj_1659	13	`` To make the venture work , they would need Fox affiliates , '' he said .
wsj_1659	14	`` We spent a lot of time and money in building our group of stations , '' he said , adding that Fox does n't `` appreciate '' another company attempting to usurp its station lineup .
wsj_1659	15	Fox said it plans to offer its stations movies , theatrical and made-for-TV ventures , probably on Wednesdays , sometime next year .
wsj_1659	16	It is also planning another night of original series .
wsj_1659	17	Paramount and MCA , according to the broadcasting executive , plan to offer theatrical movies produced separately by Paramount and MCA for Wednesdays and perhaps a block of original shows Fridays .
wsj_1659	18	The executive said Paramount and MCA have also held discussions with Chris-Craft Industries ' broadcasting unit , which owns five independent stations in cities such as Los Angeles , San Francisco and Portland , Ore .
wsj_1659	19	A Chris-Craft station manager said there have been no formal talks .
wsj_1659	20	`` I think it 's to Fox 's advantage to be associated with the Paramount-MCA venture , '' said Michael Conway , station manager of WTXF , the TVX station that is a Fox affiliate .
wsj_1659	21	Mr. Conway said the Fox shows appearing on nights when Paramount-MCA shows would n't be offered could be promoted on the programs produced by Paramount-MCA .
wsj_1659	22	Michael Fisher , general manager of KTXL , a Fox affiliate in Sacramento , Calif. , said , `` The real question is whether the Paramount-MCA offering is practical .
wsj_1659	23	It is n't ... .
wsj_1659	24	Why would I consider giving up Fox , a proven commodity , '' for an unknown venture ?
wsj_1659	25	Fox attracts a young audience with shows such as `` Married ... With Children , '' its most successful series .
wsj_1660	0	Banco Popular de Puerto Rico and BanPonce Corp. -- agreed to merge in a transaction valued at $ 324 million .
wsj_1660	1	Under the agreement , BanPonce stockholders will be able to exchange each of their shares for either shares in the new entity or cash .
wsj_1660	2	In each case , the exchange is valued at $ 56.25 a share .
wsj_1660	3	The two companies , both based in San Juan , will form a bank holding company with assets of just over $ 9 billion .
wsj_1660	4	The holding company will be called BanPonce Corp .
wsj_1660	5	The primary subsidiary will be the combined banking operations of the two companies and will be known as Banco Popular de Puerto Rico .
wsj_1660	6	Rafael Carrion Jr. , chairman of Banco Popular , will be the chairman of the holding company .
wsj_1660	7	Alberto M. Paracchini , currently chairman of BanPonce , will serve as president of the bank holding company and chairman of the subsidiary .
wsj_1660	8	Banco Popular originally proposed the merger in July , in a cash and stock transaction valued at $ 50 a share , or about $ 293 million .
wsj_1660	9	BanPonce reacted cooly at first , but appeared to be won over , analysts said , by Banco Popular 's assurances that it wanted only a friendly transaction .
wsj_1660	10	`` Banco Popular just kept waiting , '' said Edward Thompson , a vice president and analyst at Thomson BankWatch Inc. in New York .
wsj_1660	11	`` They got a transaction that 's good for both companies . ''
wsj_1660	12	The two banks appear to be a good fit .
wsj_1660	13	BanPonce caters to a more affluent customer , while Banco Popular has always had a large presence among middle-income and lower-income markets .
wsj_1660	14	The merger should also allow the companies to reduce costs by combining operations in many locations in Puerto Rico .
wsj_1660	15	`` They 're often right across the street from one another , '' Mr. Thompson said .
wsj_1660	16	Richard Carrion , who is currently president and chief executive officer of Banco Popular , said the merger will result in a `` larger and stronger locally based bank . ''
wsj_1660	17	Mr. Carrion , who will now serve as president and chief executive officer of the subsidiary bank , added : `` We 'll be able to better compete with large foreign banks .
wsj_1660	18	It makes sense from a strategic standpoint . ''
wsj_1660	19	The newly merged company will have 165 branches in Puerto Rico and 27 branches outside of the island .
wsj_1660	20	The banks said they do n't expect the merger to face any regulatory hurdles .
wsj_1660	21	Mr. Carrion said the merger should be completed in six to nine months .

wsj_1668	2	As part of a restructuring announced earlier this year , the company proposed in August to exchange 168 newly issued common shares for each $ 1,000 face value of debt .

wsj_1669	0	After years of quarreling over Bonn 's `` Ostpolitik '' , West Germany and the U.S. appear to have shifted onto a united course in Eastern Europe .
wsj_1669	1	Bonn and Washington have taken a leading role in aid for the reformist countries , pledging billions of dollars in fresh credit and forgiving old debt while urging other industrial nations to follow suit .
wsj_1669	2	Both hope to encourage pressure for change in East bloc countries still ruled by Stalinist holdouts by arranging liberal financial aid and trade benefits for Poland , Hungary and , to a lesser extent , the Soviet Union .
wsj_1669	3	West German officials also have the special goal of holding out hope for East Germany 's fledgling reform movement .
wsj_1669	4	`` The change taking place in the Soviet Union , Poland and Hungary has aroused new hope in both German states that reforms will be undertaken in East Germany , and that relations between the two German states , too , will get better , '' said Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher .
wsj_1669	5	Addressing a conference of the New York-based Institute for East-West Security Studies in Frankfurt yesterday , Mr. Genscher said , `` History will judge us by whether we have taken the opportunities that emerge from these reforms . ''
wsj_1669	6	The ultimate aim of Western support for East bloc reforms , he said , is to create `` an equitable and stable peaceful order in Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals . ''
wsj_1669	7	Mr. Genscher and U.S. Secretary of Commerce Robert A. Mosbacher , in separate speeches at the conference , appealed for more Western contributions to economic reforms and business development in Hungary and Poland .
wsj_1669	8	Bonn and Washington are leading supporters of Poland 's request for a $ 1 billion stand-by credit from the International Monetary Fund .
wsj_1669	9	`` We want the bold programs of market development and political freedom in Hungary and in Poland to succeed .
wsj_1669	10	We are prepared to support those changes , '' said Mr. Mosbacher .
wsj_1669	11	U.S. curbs on the exports of sensitive technology to East bloc countries will remain in place , however .
wsj_1669	12	Meanwhile , the U.S. House of Representatives yesterday approved an $ 837.5 million aid package for Poland and Hungary that more than doubles the amount President Bush had requested .
wsj_1669	13	The package was brought to the House just 15 days after it was introduced , indicating Congress 's eagerness to reward Poland and Hungary for their moves toward democracy and freemarket economic reforms .
wsj_1669	14	The legislation , approved 345-47 and sent to the Senate , establishes two enterprise funds , to be governed by independent nonprofit boards , which will make loans and investments in new business ventures in Hungary and Poland .
wsj_1669	15	The Polish fund would be seeded with $ 160 million , the Hungarian fund with $ 40 million .
wsj_1669	16	In addition , a group of 24 industrialized countries , including the U.S. and Japan and coordinated by the European Community Commission , has promised Poland and Hungary trade advice and a line of credit equivalent to $ 1.11 billion through the European Investment Bank , while the EC plans $ 222 million in direct aid .
wsj_1669	17	When Chancellor Helmut Kohl travels to Poland Nov. 9 , he is expected to take with him a promise of three billion West German marks $ 1.6 billion in new credit guarantees for industrial projects .
wsj_1669	18	Last week , Bonn agreed to reschedule 2.5 billion marks in Polish debt that came due last year .
wsj_1669	19	In addition , a one billion mark credit dating from 1974 is to be written off .
wsj_1669	20	Poland 's plan to switch to a free-market economy by 1991 is hampered by a foreign debt load of $ 39.2 billion .
wsj_1669	21	West Germany also has increased its credit guarantees to Hungary by 500 million marks to 1.5 billion marks as the emerging democratic state rushes through its own economic reforms , including a broad privatization of state-owned industry and tax incentives for industrial investment .
wsj_1669	22	An additional 500 million marks in credit-backing was promised by the West German state governments of Bavaria and Baden-Wuerttemberg .
wsj_1669	23	Deutsche Bank AG , which last year arranged a three billion mark credit for the Soviet Union , is now moving to become the first West German bank to set up independent business offices in Hungary and Poland as they shift to free-market economies .
wsj_1669	24	A maxim of Frankfurt banking holds that wherever Deutsche Bank goes , other West German banks follow .
wsj_1669	25	Indeed , at least four other West German banks are believed to be making inquiries .

wsj_1670	3	He said the toy company 's `` prospects for a strong fourth quarter '' are also good .
wsj_1670	4	Mattel attributed the jump in quarter net to strong world-wide sales of its Barbie doll , Hot Wheels cars , Disney toys and other well-known toy lines .

wsj_1670	8	Mattel said the company 's sale of rights to land and buildings at its Hawthorne , Calif. , headquarters resulted in a $ 13 million charge to third-quarter operating profit .
wsj_1670	9	The charge did n't affect net for the quarter as it was offset by tax benefits .

wsj_1678	0	Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. lost its second recent arbitration case involving a former bond-trading executive .
wsj_1678	1	A New York Stock Exchange arbitration panel ordered Dean Witter to pay $ 404,294 in back bonuses to William Kelly , the company 's former head of high-yield , high-risk junk-bond trading and sales .
wsj_1678	2	It also awarded $ 196,785 in back bonuses to former trader Michael Newcomb and $ 69,105 in fees to the two men 's attorneys .
wsj_1678	3	The sums awarded to Messrs. Kelly and Newcomb represent bonuses the two men said they deserved from the first half of 1988 , but which were n't paid because of a dispute over an incentive contract .
wsj_1678	4	Jeffrey L. Liddle , the two men 's attorney at Liddle , O'Connor , Finkelstein & Robinson , said Mr. Kelly began working at Dean Witter in 1987 .
wsj_1678	5	Mr. Kelly built the company 's high-yield bond group , which has been a minor player in the junk-bond arena .
wsj_1678	6	Dean Witter lost a separate case involving a former bond executive earlier this year ; in August it paid $ 666,666 in back pay and a bonus to a former corporate-bond trading chief , Harold Bachman .

wsj_1678	8	A spokesman for Dean Witter , a unit of Sears , Roebuck & Co. , declined to comment .

wsj_1680	0	American Brands Inc. said third-quarter net income rose 13 % , reflecting strong gains in its tobacco and distilled spirits businesses .
wsj_1680	1	The company , which also has businesses in life insurance , office products and hardware , and home-improvement products , said net income rose to $ 166.4 million , or $ 1.71 a share , from $ 146.8 million , or $ 1.53 a share , a year earlier .
wsj_1680	2	Year-earlier results for the quarter and the nine months were restated to reflect a change in accounting standards .
wsj_1680	3	Revenue declined 2 % , to $ 3.06 billion from $ 3.13 billion , because of the sale of Southland Life in March , and the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar on overseas results .
wsj_1680	4	Operating profit for world-wide tobacco products rose 10 % to $ 247.6 million .
wsj_1680	5	For distilled spirits , operating profit rose 36 % , to $ 24.8 million .

wsj_1680	7	The year-earlier period included $ 40.1 million , or 41 cents a share , from discontinued operations .
wsj_1680	8	Revenue rose to $ 9.03 billion from $ 8.98 billion .
wsj_1680	9	The average number of shares outstanding rose 2 % in the third quarter but was down 4 % for the nine months .

wsj_1683	0	MC SHIPPING Inc. , New York , declared an initial quarterly of 60 cents a share payable Nov. 15 to shares of record Oct. 30 .

wsj_1683	2	The company , which went public in May , intends to pay dividends from available cash flow ; the amount may vary from quarter to quarter .
wsj_1684	0	Ever since the hotly contested America 's Cup race last year , the famous yachting match has run into more rough sailing out of the water than in it .
wsj_1684	1	Now that a key member of the San Diego Yacht Club team is splitting off to form his own team , even more competition lies ahead .
wsj_1684	2	Peter Isler , the winning navigator in the past two America 's Cup challenges , has split from the team led by Dennis Conner , skipper of the victorious Stars & Stripes , to form his own team for the next contest in 1992 .
wsj_1684	3	And , in addition to a crack team of sailors , Mr. Isler has lined up some real brass to help him finance the syndicate .
wsj_1684	4	Isler Sailing International 's advisory board includes Ted Turner , Turner Broadcasting chairman and a former Cup victor ; Peter G. Diamandis , head of Diamandis Communications , and Joseph B. Vittoria , chairman and chief executive of Avis Inc .
wsj_1684	5	His steering committee includes other notable businessmen , including the California investor and old salt Roy E. Disney .
wsj_1684	6	`` We have the structure , people and plan , '' Mr. Isler said in a statement .
wsj_1684	7	Now , the first order of business is raising enough money to keep his team afloat -- a new yacht will cost about $ 3 million alone , and sailing syndicate budgets can easily run to $ 25 million for a Cup challenge .
wsj_1684	8	The split comes in the midst of a court battle over whether the San Diego Yacht Club should be allowed to keep the international trophy for sailing a catamaran against the New Zealand challengers ' 90-foot monohull .
wsj_1684	9	In September , a New York appellate court overturned a state judge 's ruling that awarded the Cup to the New Zealand team .
wsj_1684	10	Pending an appeal by the New Zealand team , led by Michael Fay , the finals for the next Cup challenge are scheduled to be held in mid-1992 in San Diego .
wsj_1684	11	But because of the uncertainty of the outcome of the suit , Mr. Conner 's team has done little to begin gearing up to defend its title .
wsj_1684	12	`` If you do n't know what the rules of the game are , it 's hard to start your fund-raising or design , '' said Dana Smith , an official with Team Dennis Conner .
wsj_1684	13	The Conner team wo n't be able to negotiate with corporate sponsors until the suit is resolved and the race site is determined , Mr. Smith said , and the syndicate 's budget could easily reach $ 30 million .
wsj_1684	14	But spokesmen for both Mr. Isler and Mr. Conner say the formation of the new syndicate has to do with Mr. Isler 's desire to skipper his own team and begin planning now , rather than any falling out between the two sportsmen .
wsj_1684	15	Mr. Smith and a spokesman for the America 's Cup Organizing Committee insist that the added competition for the defender 's spot will only improve the race .
wsj_1685	0	Missouri farmer Blake Hurst writing in the fall issue of the Heritage Foundation 's Policy Review about the proposed location of a hazardous-waste incinerator in his county :
wsj_1685	1	Of course I 'd rather have a computer software firm in my backyard than a hazardous waste incinerator .
wsj_1685	2	But I 'd also rather live next door to an incinerator than to some of the hog farms I 've seen and smelt in these parts .
wsj_1685	3	An incinerator is also probably better than having nobody next door -- on our farm there are four unoccupied houses .
wsj_1685	4	On my four-mile drive to farm headquarters each morning , I drive by another four empty houses .
wsj_1685	5	A community of abandoned farmsteads , failing businesses , and crumbling roads and bridges is hardly a desirable one ... .
wsj_1685	6	The loss of 40 jobs by a depressed county in rural Missouri is hardly of national importance except for this : If the most environmentally safe way of dealing with a national problem can not be built in Atchinson County , what hope have we for dealing with the wastes our economy produces ?
wsj_1685	7	After all , farmers here work with `` hazardous '' chemicals every day , many of them the same chemicals that would have been destroyed in the incinerator .
wsj_1685	8	We know they are dangerous , but if handled with care , their benefits far outweigh any risk to the environment .
wsj_1686	0	Just because Stamford , Conn. , High School did nothing when its valuable 1930s mural was thrown in the trash does n't mean the city no longer owns the work of art , a federal judge ruled .
wsj_1686	1	The mural , now valued at $ 1.3 million according to appraisers , was tossed in a trash heap in 1971 by workers who were renovating the building .
wsj_1686	2	The 100-foot-long mural , painted by James Daugherty in 1934 , was commissioned by the federal Works Project Administration .
wsj_1686	3	After the discarded mural was found outside the school by a concerned Stamford graduate , it eventually was turned over to Hiram Hoelzer , a professional art restorer .
wsj_1686	4	Throughout the 1970s , Stamford school and city officials made no effort to locate the mural .
wsj_1686	5	Apparently the officials did n't even know the mural was missing until 1980 , when a researcher found that the painting was in Mr. Hoelzer 's studio and questioned school officials about it .
wsj_1686	6	In 1986 , Stamford officials thanked Mr. Hoelzer for taking care of the mural -- and demanded he return it as soon as possible .
wsj_1686	7	Mr. Hoelzer , however , sued Stamford , claiming that the city had abandoned the artwork and that it had waited too long to reclaim it .
wsj_1686	8	But Judge Louis L. Stanton of federal court in Manhattan ruled that the city could n't be faulted for waiting too long because it did n't realize until 1986 that its ownership of the painting was in dispute .
wsj_1686	9	The judge also ruled that the painting was n't abandoned because officials did n't intend for it to be thrown away and were unaware that the workmen had discarded it .
wsj_1686	10	Mr. Hoelzer did n't return phone calls seeking comment on the judge 's decision .
wsj_1686	11	The judge ordered that a hearing be held Nov. 17 to determine how much the city should pay Mr. Hoelzer for his services .
wsj_1686	12	Mary E. Sommer , corporate counsel for Stamford , said the city has discussed several possible plans for displaying the mural , which portrays various scenes from the Great Depression .
wsj_1686	13	She said the mural `` preserves an era in Stamford and in our country when this type of work was being done .
wsj_1688	0	Melvin Belli 's San Francisco law offices may have been the epicenter of legal activity after Tuesday 's earthquake .
wsj_1688	1	In the first 25 minutes after his office 's telephone service was restored yesterday morning , 17 potential clients had called seeking the services of the self-proclaimed King of Torts .
wsj_1688	2	Mr. Belli , like many other personal-injury lawyers , suspects that the earthquake , which measured 6.9 on the Richter scale , will generate enough lawsuits to keep this city 's personal-injury and construction lawyers busy for quite some time .
wsj_1688	3	Suits are likely to be filed against engineering firms , contractors and developers , as well as against local-government agencies .
wsj_1688	4	But lawyers looking to cash in on the quake may have a tough time once their cases reach a judge .
wsj_1688	5	Experts on California tort law say protections afforded government agencies in such cases are pretty ironclad .
wsj_1688	6	Even claims against individuals and companies face significant roadblocks .
wsj_1688	7	The major legal barrier is the principle that no one can be held liable for an `` act of God . ''
wsj_1688	8	For now , says Laurence Drivon , president-elect of the 6,000-member California Trial Lawyers Association , `` the last thing we really need to worry about is whether anybody is going to get sued , or whether they have liability or not .
wsj_1688	9	We still have people wandering around in a daze in San Francisco worrying about whether it 's going to rain tonight . ''
wsj_1688	10	But that wo n't stop plaintiffs ' lawyers from seeking a little room for maneuvering .
wsj_1688	11	In San Francisco , they argue , an earthquake was a near certainty .
wsj_1688	12	Therefore , engineering firms , construction contractors and developers can be sued for not keeping structures up to standard , and government agencies can be held accountable for failing to properly protect citizens from such a foreseeable disaster , if negligence can be proven .
wsj_1688	13	`` My prediction is there will be mass litigation over errors and omissions in engineering and contracting , '' says Stanley Chesley , a well-known Cincinnati plaintiffs lawyer .
wsj_1688	14	From what he saw on television , Mr. Chesley points out that Interstate 880 , which collapsed and killed more than 200 commuters , suffered serious damage while surrounding buildings appeared to sustain no damage whatsoever .
wsj_1688	15	He adds that `` they were aware of the propensity for earthquakes and the San Andreas Fault . ''
wsj_1688	16	The flamboyant and publicity-conscious Mr. Belli says he already has investigators looking into who could be held liable for the damage on the Bay Bridge and the interstate approaching it .
wsj_1688	17	`` We wo n't know until the smoke clears -- but yes , we 're looking into it , '' he says .
wsj_1688	18	Mr. Belli says he wants to know whether state or federal engineers or private companies could have prevented the damage .
wsj_1688	19	Mr. Belli , who was at Candlestick Park for the World Series Tuesday night , says he has hired civil engineers to check out his own mildly damaged building and to investigate the bridge collapse .
wsj_1688	20	Defense lawyers , perhaps understandably , say that plaintiffs ' lawyers taking such an approach will have little success in pursuing their claims , though they add that the facts of each case must be looked at individually .
wsj_1688	21	`` A lot of this is going to be code-related , '' says Ignazio J. Ruvolo , a construction law specialist at Bronson , Bronson & McKinnon , a San Francisco law firm .
wsj_1688	22	Plaintiffs , he says , will argue that damaged structures were n't built to proper design standards .
wsj_1688	23	But if defendants can prove that they met San Francisco 's stringent building codes , `` that 's probably going to protect them , '' Mr. Ruvolo says .
wsj_1688	24	Government entities , continues Mr. Ruvolo , could be protected by the California Government Tort Liability Act .
wsj_1688	25	Under the statute , agencies are provided `` defenses that normally are n't available in the private sector , '' Mr. Ruvolo says .
wsj_1688	26	`` The legislature does not want to inhibit the unique government activities by exposing public entities to liability . ''
wsj_1688	27	Built into the statute are so-called design immunities , which are likely to protect government agencies , according to Mr. Ruvolo and Richard Covert , a lawyer with the California Department of Transportation , which oversees the damaged Bay Bridge .
wsj_1688	28	The state is protected when plans and designs for public structures were approved ahead of time or when structures met previously approved standards , says Mr. Covert .
wsj_1688	29	He believes those defenses might well apply to the Bay Bridge collapse .
wsj_1688	30	Nevertheless , he adds , `` I would n't get totally shocked if we get lawsuits out of the Bay Bridge . ''
wsj_1688	31	If there 's going to be a race to the courthouse , it has n't started yet .
wsj_1688	32	Mr. Covert had to search through law books scattered on the floor of his office yesterday , and Mr. Belli 's courtyard was strewn with bricks .
wsj_1688	33	Wednesday , Mr. Belli 's staff was n't permitted into his office by city officials worried about their safety .
wsj_1688	34	He said he set up shop on the sidewalk in front of his town-house office and helped victims apply for federal aid -- free of charge .
wsj_1688	35	In a news release issued by Mr. Drivon , the trial lawyers association also promised free assistance to victims .
wsj_1688	36	The association said it would monitor the conduct of lawyers and warned that solicitation of business is unethical .
wsj_1689	0	What 's in a name ?
wsj_1689	1	Apparently a lot , according to the British firm of Deloitte , Haskins & Sells .
wsj_1689	2	The British firm has begun court proceedings in London to prevent the use of the name `` Deloitte '' by Deloitte , Haskins & Sells and Touche Ross & Co. in England and the rest of the world .
wsj_1689	3	The British Deloitte firm recently withdrew from the merger of Deloitte and Touche world-wide and joined Coopers & Lybrand .
wsj_1689	4	John Bullock , senior partner of Deloitte in the U.K. , said `` the decision to start these proceedings has n't been taken lightly . ''
wsj_1689	5	Mr. Bullock said the British firm has used the name `` Deloitte '' since 1845 .
wsj_1689	6	In the U.S. , Deloitte , Haskins & Sells was known as Haskins & Sells until 1978 , when it added the `` Deloitte '' name of its British affiliate .
wsj_1689	7	John C. Burton , an accounting professor at Columbia University 's Graduate School of Business , said `` there 's a lot of emotion involved in the name of an accounting firm with a long history and with roots in England , where accounting predates the U.S. . ''
wsj_1689	8	Although accountants are n't noted as `` being deeply emotional , they really hold it all in , '' said Mr. Burton , former chief accountant of the Securities and Exchange Commission .
wsj_1689	9	J. Michael Cook , chairman of Deloitte , Haskins & Sells International , said he believes the legal action by the British firm `` to be without merit . ''
wsj_1689	10	Mr. Cook said that last June , the international executive committes of Deloitte and Touche agreed to a world-wide merger .
wsj_1689	11	`` The merger is proceeding according to plan , except as to the withdrawal of the Deloitte U.K. firm , '' he said .
wsj_1689	12	Partners at other accounting firms say that the Deloitte firm in the U.K. is filing the suit to get even with the merged Deloitte-Touche firm for keeping major auditing work in England .
wsj_1689	13	General Motors Corp. , a Deloitte audit client , for example , has agreed to keep its annual $ 18 million world-wide audit and associated tax work with the merged Deloitte-Touche firm , to be known as Deloitte & Touche in the U.S. .
wsj_1689	14	In England , this would mean that the British Deloitte would lose revenue for its audit of GM 's Vauxhill unit .
wsj_1689	15	The defection of Deloitte 's affiliates in Britain and the Netherlands to Coopers & Lybrand will make Coopers one of the biggest accounting firms in Europe , rivaling KPMG Peat Marwick there .
wsj_1689	16	Although Coopers has n't been courted by other major accounting firms for a merger , it is benefiting greatly from fallout from the Deloitte-Touche merger .
wsj_1689	17	In New York , Harris Amhowitz , general counsel of Coopers , said Coopers `` was aware of the litigation , '' but he declined further comment .
wsj_1689	18	He also declined to comment on the name that Coopers would use in England if Deloitte UK won its litigation to keep its name .
wsj_1689	19	Coopers uses the Coopers & Lybrand name world-wide .
wsj_1690	0	William Bennett , the White House drug-policy director , accused local officials in the Washington area of blocking construction of prison facilities to house convicted drug dealers .
wsj_1690	1	`` Politics has essentially put up a roadblock '' to finding sites for new federal prisons , Mr. Bennett said at a news conference called to report on his `` emergency assistance program '' for the capital .
wsj_1690	2	Without more space to incarcerate convicted criminals , he added , `` we will not win the war on drugs . ''
wsj_1690	3	Mr. Bennett declared in April that he would make Washington a `` test case '' for how the Bush administration would aid cities afflicted by heavy drug trafficking and violence .
wsj_1690	4	The drug czar claimed that enforcement efforts are working here , `` albeit at a slower and more halting pace than we would like . ''
wsj_1690	5	He acknowledged , however , that Washington 's `` drug-related murder rate is intolerably high .
wsj_1690	6	The prisons are too crowded .
wsj_1690	7	Drugs continue to be sold openly around schools , parks and housing projects . ''
wsj_1690	8	Mr. Bennett declined to name the area officials who he believes have impeded plans for building more federal prisons to ease Washington 's problem .
wsj_1690	9	But other Bush administration officials have criticized Maryland Gov. William Schaefer for blocking the use of possible sites in that state .
wsj_1690	10	Administration officials also have said that Washington Mayor Marion Barry has delayed consideration of sites in the city .
wsj_1690	11	In a letter to Mr. Bennett 's office , released yesterday , Washington 's city administrator , Carol Thompson , complained that the drug czar had exaggerated the amount of federal drug-related assistance provided to the capital .
wsj_1690	12	Referring to Mr. Bennett 's claim that the federal government would provide $ 97 million in emergency federal support , Ms. Thompson wrote , `` Our analysis was unable to even come close to documenting that figure . ''
wsj_1690	13	Of his successes in Washington , Mr. Bennett stressed that existing federal prisons have taken custody of 375 local inmates .
wsj_1690	14	He also noted that the federal Drug Enforcement Administration has established a federal-local task force responsible since April for 106 arrests and more than $ 2 million in seizures of drug dealers ' assets .
wsj_1690	15	The Defense Department has lent the Washington U.S. attorney 10 prosecutors , and the Federal Bureau of Investigation has provided crime laboratory facilities and training , he added .
wsj_1692	0	Former Democratic fund-raiser Thomas M. Gaubert , whose savings and loan was wrested from his control by federal thrift regulators , has been granted court permission to sue the regulators .
wsj_1692	1	In a ruling by the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans , Mr. Gaubert received the go-ahead to pursue a claim against the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas for losses he suffered when the Bank Board closed the Independent American Savings Association of Irving , Texas .
wsj_1692	2	Mr. Gaubert , who was chairman and the majority stockholder of Independent American , had relinquished his control in exchange for federal regulators ' agreement to drop their inquiry into his activities at another savings and loan .
wsj_1692	3	As part of the agreement , Mr. Gaubert contributed real estate valued at $ 25 million to the assets of Independent American .
wsj_1692	4	While under the control of federal regulators , Independent American 's net worth dropped from $ 75 million to a negative $ 400 million , wiping out the value of Mr. Gaubert 's real estate contribution and his stock in the institution .
wsj_1692	5	Mr. Gaubert 's suit to recover his damages was dismissed last year by U.S. District Judge Robert Maloney of Dallas under the Federal Tort Claims Act , which offers broad protection for actions by federal agencies and employees .
wsj_1692	6	Earlier this week , a Fifth Circuit appellate panel upheld Judge Maloney 's dismissal of Mr. Gaubert 's claim as a shareholder but said the judge should reconsider Mr. Gaubert 's claim for the loss of his property .
wsj_1692	7	`` It may depend on whether there was an express or implied promise ... that the federal officials would not negligently cause the deterioration '' of Independent American , the court wrote .
wsj_1692	8	Mr. Gaubert 's lawyer , Abbe David Lowell of Washington , D.C. , says the impact of the ruling on other cases involving thrift takeovers will depend on the degree of similarity in the facts .
wsj_1692	9	`` I do n't know if this will affect one institution or a hundred , '' Mr. Lowell says .
wsj_1692	10	`` It does establish a very clear precedent for suing the FHLBB where there was none before . ''
wsj_1692	11	MAITRE'D CLAIMS in suit that restaurant fired her because she was pregnant .
wsj_1692	12	In a suit filed in state court in Manhattan , the American Civil Liberties Union is representing the former maitre 'd of the chic Odeon restaurant .
wsj_1692	13	The suit , which seeks compensatory and punitive damages of $ 1 million , alleges that the firing of Marcia Trees Levine violated New York state 's human-rights law .
wsj_1692	14	Among other things , the law prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex and pregnancy .
wsj_1692	15	The suit alleges that Ms. Levine was fired after she refused to accept a lower paying , less visible job upon reaching her sixth month of pregnancy .
wsj_1692	16	Ms. Levine told her employer that she was pregnant in February ; a month later , the suit says , the restaurant manager told Ms. Levine that she would be demoted to his assistant because he felt customers would be uncomfortable with a pregnant maitre 'd .
wsj_1692	17	Kary Moss , an attorney with the ACLU 's Women 's Rights Project , said , `` They wanted a svelte-looking woman , and a pregnant woman is not svelte .
wsj_1692	18	They told her , ` We do n't hire fat people and we do n't hire cripples .
wsj_1692	19	And pregnant women are fat . ' ''
wsj_1692	20	Ms. Moss said Ms. Levine secretly taped many conversations with her bosses at the Odeon in which they told her she was being fired as maitre 'd because she was pregnant .
wsj_1692	21	Paul H. Aloe , an attorney for Odeon owner Keith McNally , denied the allegations .
wsj_1692	22	He said Ms. Levine had never been fired , although she had stopped working at the restaurant .
wsj_1692	23	`` The Odeon made a written offer to Marcia Levine on July 10 to return to work as the maitre 'd , at the same pay , same hours and with back pay accrued , '' he said .
wsj_1692	24	Mr. Aloe said the Odeon `` has no policy against hiring pregnant people . ''

wsj_1695	0	Tuesday 's rout of a GOP congressional hopeful in a Mississippi district that has n't backed a Democratic presidential candidate since Adlai Stevenson is another reminder that , at least at the federal level , political `` ticket splitting '' has been on the rise over the past half century .
wsj_1695	1	In only one presidential election year prior to 1948 did more than 20 % of the nation 's congressional districts choose a different party 's candidate for the White House than for the House of Representatives .
wsj_1695	2	Now that percentage routinely equals a third and twice has been above 40 % .
wsj_1695	3	As we know , voters tend to favor Republicans more in races for president than in those for Congress .
wsj_1695	4	In every presidential election over the past half century , except for the Goldwater presidential candidacy , the GOP has captured a greater percentage of the major-party popular vote for president than it has of congressional seats or the popular vote for Congress .
wsj_1695	5	Prior to 1932 , the pattern was nearly the opposite .
wsj_1695	6	What accounts for the results of recent decades ?
wsj_1695	7	A simple economic theory may provide at least a partial explanation for the split personality displayed by Americans in the voting booth .
wsj_1695	8	The theory relies on three assumptions :
wsj_1695	9	1 Voters can `` buy '' one of two brands when they select their political agents -- a Republican brand that believes in the minimalist state and in the virtues of private markets over the vices of public action , and a Democratic brand that believes in big government and in public intervention to remedy the excesses attendant to the pursuit of private interest .
wsj_1695	10	2 Congressional representatives have two basic responsibilities while voting in office -- dealing with national issues programmatic actions such as casting roll call votes on legislation that imposes costs and/or confers benefits on the population at large and attending to local issues constituency service and pork barrel .
wsj_1695	11	3 Republican congressional representatives , because of their belief in a minimalist state , are less willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than are Democratic members of Congress .
wsj_1695	12	If these assumptions hold , voters in races for Congress face what in economic theory is called a prisoner 's dilemma and have an incentive , at the margin , to lean Democratic .
wsj_1695	13	If they put a Republican into office , not only will they acquire less in terms of local benefits but their selected legislator will be relatively powerless to prevent other legislators from `` bringing home the bacon '' to their respective constituencies .
wsj_1695	14	Each legislator , after all , is only one out of 535 when it comes to national policy making .
wsj_1695	15	In races for the White House , a voter 's incentive , at the margin , is to lean Republican .
wsj_1695	16	Although a GOP president may limit local benefits to the voter 's particular district/state , such a president is also likely to be more effective at preventing other districts/states and their legislators from bringing home the local benefits .
wsj_1695	17	The individual voter 's standing consequently will be enhanced through lower taxes .
wsj_1695	18	While this theory is exceedingly simple , it appears to explain several things .
wsj_1695	19	First , why ticket splitting has increased and taken the peculiar pattern that it has over the past half century : Prior to the election of Franklin Roosevelt as president and the advent of the New Deal , government occupied a much smaller role in society and the prisoner 's dilemma problem confronting voters in races for Congress was considerably less severe .
wsj_1695	20	Second , it explains why voters hold Congress in disdain but generally love their own congressional representatives : Any individual legislator 's constituents appreciate the specific benefits that the legislator wins for them but not the overall cost associated with every other legislator doing likewise for his own constituency .
wsj_1695	21	Third , the theory suggests why legislators who pay too much attention to national policy making relative to local benefit-seeking have lower security in office .
wsj_1695	22	For example , first-term members of the House , once the most vulnerable of incumbents , have become virtually immune to defeat .
wsj_1695	23	The one exception to this recent trend was the defeat of 13 of the 52 freshman Republicans brought into office in 1980 by the Reagan revolution and running for re-election in 1982 .
wsj_1695	24	Because these freshmen placed far more emphasis on their partisan role -- spreading the Reagan revolution -- in national policy making , they were more vulnerable to defeat .
wsj_1695	25	Fourth , the theory indicates why the Republican Party may have a difficult time attracting viable candidates for congressional office .
wsj_1695	26	Potential candidates may be discouraged from running less by the congressional salary than by the prospect of defeat at the hands of a Democratic opponent .
wsj_1695	27	To the extent that potential Republican candidates and their financial backers realize that the congressional prisoner 's dilemma game works to their disadvantage , the Republican Party will be hindered in its attempts to field a competitive slate of congressional candidates .
wsj_1695	28	Fifth , the theory may provide at least a partial reason for why ticket splitting has been particularly pronounced in the South .
wsj_1695	29	To the extent that Democratic legislators from the South have held a disproportionate share of power in Congress since 1932 and have been able to translate such clout into relatively more local benefits for their respective constituencies , voters in the South have had an especially strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office .
wsj_1695	30	Finally , the theory suggests why Republicans generally have fared better in Senate races than in campaigns for the House .
wsj_1695	31	Since local benefit-seeking matters more and national policy making matters less in the lower chamber of Congress , this is precisely the pattern one would expect if Republicans are less willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than their Democratic counterparts .
wsj_1695	32	Is there any empirical support for this theory ?
wsj_1695	33	Three pieces of evidence corroborate the key assumption that Democratic legislators are more willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than their Republican colleagues .
wsj_1695	34	First , economists James Bennett and Thomas DiLorenzo find that GOP senators turn back roughly 10 % more of their allocated personal staff budgets than Democrats do .
wsj_1695	35	To the extent that the primary duty of personal staff involves local benefit-seeking , this indicates that political philosophy leads congressional Republicans to pay less attention to narrow constituent concerns .
wsj_1695	36	Second , if the key assumption is valid , Democrats should have lower attendance rates on roll-call votes than Republicans do to the extent that such votes reflect national policy making and that participating in such votes takes away from the time a legislator could otherwise devote to local benefit-seeking .
wsj_1695	37	This is indeed what the data indicate , particularly in the case of the House .
wsj_1695	38	The Democratic House attendance rate has not exceeded the Republican House attendance rate since 1959 .
wsj_1695	39	Finally , as shown in the table , Democrats allocate a higher proportion of their personal staffs to district offices -- where local benefit-seeking duties matter more and national policy making activities matter less relative to Washington offices .
wsj_1695	40	An examination of changes in personal staffing decisions in the Senate between 1986 and 1987 when control of that body changed party hands , moreover , reveals that the personal staffing differences noted in the table can not be attributed to the disproportionate control Democrats exercise , due to their majority-party status , over other resources such as committee staff .
wsj_1695	41	An additional piece of evidence from the Senate : Holding other factors constant , such as incumbency advantages and regional factors , the difference between popular votes for Republican presidential and senatorial candidates in states conducting a Senate election turns out to be a positive function of how onerous the federal government 's tax burden is per state a progressive tax rate hits higher-income states harder .
wsj_1695	42	Put more simply , GOP candidates for president are looked on more kindly by voters than Republican candidates for the Senate when the prisoner 's dilemma is more severe .
wsj_1695	43	Moreover , ticket splitting appears to take the same peculiar pattern at the state government level as it does at the federal level .
wsj_1695	44	State government is more typically split along Republican-governor/Democratic-legislature lines than the reverse .
wsj_1695	45	A cross-state econometric investigation , furthermore , reveals that , holding other factors constant , the difference between a state 's major-party vote going to the Republican gubernatorial candidate and the Republican share of the lower state house is a positive function of the state tax rate .
wsj_1695	46	In sum , at both the federal and state government levels at least part of the seemingly irrational behavior voters display in the voting booth may have an exceedingly rational explanation .
wsj_1695	47	Mr. Zupan teaches at the University of Southern California 's business school .
wsj_1696	0	A House-Senate conference approved a nearly $ 17 billion State , Justice and Commerce Department bill that makes federal reparations for Japanese-Americans held in World War II internment camps a legal entitlement after next Oct. 1 .
wsj_1696	1	The measure provides no money for the promised payments until then , but beginning in fiscal 1991 , the government would be committed to meeting annual payments of as much as $ 500 million until the total liability of approximately $ 1.25 billion is paid .
wsj_1696	2	The action abandons earlier efforts to find offsetting cuts to fund the payments , but is widely seen as a more realistic means of expediting reparations first authorized in 1988 .
wsj_1696	3	The action came as Congress sent to President Bush a fiscal 1990 bill providing an estimated $ 156.7 billion for the Departments of Labor , Education , Health and Human Services .
wsj_1696	4	Final approval was on a 67-31 roll call in the Senate , which sets the stage for a veto confrontation with Mr. Bush over the issue of publicly financed abortions for poor women .
wsj_1696	5	Reversing an eight-year federal policy , the measure supports Medicaid abortions in cases of rape and incest , but Mr. Bush has so far refused to support any specific exemption beyond instances in which the mother 's life is in danger .
wsj_1696	6	Mr. Bush 's veto power puts him a commanding position in the narrowly divided House , but a vote to override his position could well pick up new support because of the wealth of health and education programs financed in the underlying bill .
wsj_1696	7	The measure before the conference yesterday funds the Departments of State , Justice and Commerce through fiscal 1990 .
wsj_1696	8	An estimated $ 1.32 billion is provided for next year 's census , and negotiators stripped a Senate-passed rider seeking to block the counting of illegal aliens .
wsj_1696	9	Elsewhere in the Commerce Department , nearly $ 191.2 million is preserved for assistance programs under the Economic Development Administration .
wsj_1696	10	And in a footnote to the fall of House Speaker James Wright this year , the conference voted to rescind $ 11.8 million in unspent EDA funds for a Fort Worth , Texas , stockyards project that figured in ethics charges against the former Democratic leader .
wsj_1696	11	Fiscal pressures also forced the adoption of new fees charged by federal agencies , and an 18 % increase in the Securities and Exchange Commission 's budget would be financed entirely by an added $ 26 million in filing fees .
wsj_1696	12	In an unprecedented step , the measure anticipates another $ 30 million in receipts by having the Federal Bureau of Investigation charge for fingerprint services in civil cases -- a change that is almost certain to increase Pentagon costs in processing personnel and security clearances .
wsj_1696	13	The bill does n't include an estimated $ 1.9 billion in supplemental anti-drug funds for Justice Department and law-enforcement accounts that are still in conference with the House .
wsj_1696	14	But yesterday 's agreement would make it easier for state governments to handle the promised aid by deferring for one year a scheduled 50 % increase in the required state matching funds for law-enforcement grants .
wsj_1696	15	Similarly , the measure adjusts the current funding formula to promise smaller states such as New Hampshire and Delaware a minimum allocation of $ 1.6 million each in drug grants , or three times the current minimum .
wsj_1696	16	The odd mix of departments in the bill makes it one of the more eclectic of the annual appropriations measures , and the assorted provisions attached by lawmakers run from $ 1.5 million for a fish farm in Arkansas to a music festival in Moscow under the United States Information Agency .
wsj_1696	17	Lawmakers scrapped all of a $ 7.4 million State Department request for the 1992 Expo in Seville , Spain , but agreed elsewhere to $ 15,000 for an oil portrait of former Chief Justice Warren Burger .
wsj_1696	18	Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Ernest Hollings D. , S.C. , who also chairs the Senate appropriations subcommittee for the department , attached $ 10 million for an advanced technology initiative , including work on high-definition television .
wsj_1696	19	His Republican counterpart , Sen. Warren Rudman R. , N.H. , has used his position to wage a legislative war with the conservative board of the Legal Services Corp .
wsj_1696	20	An estimated $ 321 million is provided to maintain the program , but Mr. Rudman also succeeded in attaching language seeking to curb the authority of the current board until new members are confirmed .
wsj_1696	21	The effective date of any new regulations by the current board would be delayed until Oct. 1 next year , and the bill seeks to reverse efforts by the corporation to cut off funds to service organizations such as the Food Research and Action Center .
wsj_1696	22	The bill also provides $ 620.5 million to meet U.S. contributions to international organizations and $ 80 million for peace-keeping activities .
wsj_1696	23	Both accounts reflect significant increases from fiscal 1989 , although the amount for peace-keeping shows a 27 % cut from the administration 's request .

wsj_1702	0	Cipher Data Products Inc. posted a net loss of $ 14.2 million , or 97 cents a share , for its fiscal first quarter , compared with net income of $ 3.8 million , or 27 cents a share , a year ago .
wsj_1702	1	Revenue for the quarter ended Sept. 30 fell 20 % , to $ 41.3 million from $ 51.9 million in the year-earlier period .
wsj_1702	2	Cipher Data , a San Diego maker of magnetic tape peripherals and optical disc drives , said the loss included reserves of $ 3.8 million related to a corporate restructuring .
wsj_1702	3	The restructuring calls for a 24 % reduction in its work force over the next two months , affecting about 525 jobs , Cipher Data said .
wsj_1702	4	It is eliminating the positions of president and chief operating officer , formerly held by Edward L. Marinaro .
wsj_1702	5	Cipher Data said Mr. Marinaro consequently has resigned from those posts and from the company 's board .

wsj_1703	0	FileNet Corp. , Costa Mesa , Calif. , said it expects to report a third-quarter loss of about $ 1.8 million , or 17 cents a share , because of a $ 2.5 million reserve to be taken against potential losses on a contract with the state of California .
wsj_1703	1	Revenue is estimated at $ 18.6 million .
wsj_1703	2	The maker of document image processing equipment said the state procurement division had declared FileNet in default on its contract with the secretary of state uniform commercial code division .

wsj_1706	0	Dell Computer Corp. , squeezed by price pressure from its larger competitors and delays in its new product line , said its per-share earnings for fiscal 1990 will be half its previous forecasts .
wsj_1706	1	Although the personal computer maker said it expects revenue to meet or exceed previous projections of $ 385 million for the year ending Jan. 28 , 1990 , earnings are expected to be 25 cents to 35 cents a share , down from previous estimates of 50 cents to 60 cents .
wsj_1706	2	Earnings for fiscal 1989 were $ 14.4 million , or 80 cents a share , on sales of $ 257.8 million .
wsj_1706	3	Results for the third quarter ending Oct. 31 , are expected to be released the third week of November , according to Michael Dell , chairman and chief executive officer .
wsj_1706	4	Mr. Dell said he does n't expect a loss in either the third or fourth quarter , but said third-quarter earnings could be as low as four cents a share .
wsj_1706	5	In the third quarter last year , Dell had net income of $ 5 million , or 26 cents a share , on sales of $ 75.2 million .
wsj_1706	6	Mr. Dell attributed the earnings slide to new product delays , such as a laptop scheduled for September that wo n't be introduced until early November .
wsj_1706	7	Some delays have been caused by a shortage of micoprocessors -- notably Intel Corp. 's newest chip , the 486 -- but others apparently have been caused by Dell 's explosive growth and thinly stretched resources .
wsj_1706	8	`` They 've got a lot of different balls in the air at the same time , '' observes Jim Poyner , a computer securities analyst with Dallas-based William K. Woodruff & Co .
wsj_1706	9	Mr. Dell , meanwhile , concedes the company was `` definitely too optimistic '' in its expectations .
wsj_1706	10	Product delays , however , have left Dell buffeted by harsher competition in its bread-and-butter line of desktop computers , as powerhouse competitors Compaq Computer Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. price their PCs more aggressively .
wsj_1706	11	The result has been thinner margins , which have been further eroded by an ambitious research and development effort and rapid overseas expansion .
wsj_1706	12	Analyst James Weil of the Soundview Financial Group believes Dell 's response has been to place increased emphasis on product quality , `` in an effort to rise above some of that price pressure . ''
wsj_1706	13	But that has been the key to Compaq 's success , he adds , whereas Dell carved out its market niche as a direct seller of low-cost but reliable computers -- and it might be too late in the game for a shift in strategy .
wsj_1706	14	In national over-the-counter trading , Dell closed yesterday at $ 6 a share , down 87.5 cents .
wsj_1707	0	TransAtlantic Holdings PLC , a British-based , South African-controlled financial services investment group , and France 's Societe Centrale Union des Assurances de Paris reached an accord effectively reducing chances of an unfriendly takeover for Sun Life Assurance Society PLC .
wsj_1707	1	In a joint statement , the two companies , whose combined holdings equal 52.7 % of Sun Life 's ordinary shares , said their agreement is aimed at reducing `` the uncertainty and instability for Sun Life that has resulted from two major shareholders owning '' a controlling interest in the company .
wsj_1707	2	TransAtlantic , whose Transol Investments Ltd. unit owns the largest minority stake in Sun Life , has agreed not to make a takeover bid for the British life insurer without the prior consent of the French company , known as UAP .
wsj_1707	3	In return , the agreement would force UAP to buy TransAtlantic 's 29.8 % holding in Sun Life or sell its 22.9 % stake to TransAtlantic at a price set by Transatlantic .
wsj_1708	0	Pride Petroleum Services Inc. said it agreed to buy well-servicing assets of two companies and expects to report higher third-quarter revenue and earnings .

wsj_1708	2	Results for the earlier quarter included a $ 100,000 restructuring charge .
wsj_1708	3	Separately , the Houston concern said it signed letters of intent for the cash and stock purchases of a total of 29 well-servicing rigs from two concerns located in New Mexico and California .
wsj_1708	4	It did n't disclose specifics but said it expects to complete the purchases by Nov. 1 .
wsj_1709	0	Schlumberger Ltd. , New York , reported third-quarter net income edged up as growth in its oil-field services sector offset a decline in interest income .
wsj_1709	1	The lower interest income occurred because Schlumberger spent $ 1.2 billion buying back its stock last year .
wsj_1709	2	Net for the oil-field services and electronic measurements and systems concern rose to $ 114.2 million , or 48 cents a share , from $ 112.2 million , or 42 cents a share , a year earlier .
wsj_1709	3	Per-share earnings advanced 14 % because of the buy-back .
wsj_1709	4	Revenue declined 6.3 % to $ 1.11 billion from $ 1.18 billion .

wsj_1711	0	The French building group Dumez S.A. said profit jumped 70 % in the first half of 1989 , partly on the strength of nonrecurring gains from a share issue by its Canadian unit .
wsj_1711	1	Dumez said group profit after payments to minority interests rose to 252 million francs $ 40.1 million from 148 million a year earlier .
wsj_1711	2	Revenue rose 40 % to 13.32 billion francs from 9.53 billion .
wsj_1711	3	The group noted that 75 million francs of the advance reflected a one-time gain from the June offering by its United Westburne unit in Canada .
wsj_1711	4	It did n't say if its year-earlier results were influenced significantly by nonrecurring elements .
wsj_1711	5	For all of 1988 , Dumez had group profit of 452 million francs after payment to minority interests .

wsj_1731	0	After slipping on news of a smaller-than-expected U.S. inflation figure , the dollar rebounded later in the trading day .
wsj_1731	1	The U.S. unit dipped to a session low against the mark just after the release of the U.S. consumer price index .
wsj_1731	2	The report showed that September consumer prices rose just 0.2 % , a smaller increase than expected .
wsj_1731	3	The market had anticipated a 0.4 % rise in the price index .
wsj_1731	4	The September index fueled speculation , damaging to the dollar , that the Federal Reserve soon will ease monetary policy further .
wsj_1731	5	But foreign-exchange dealers said the dollar staged a quick comeback , prompted by a round of short covering and some fresh buying interest later in the trading day .
wsj_1731	6	Traders said that a nearly 40-point gain in the Dow Jones Industrial Average , fueled in part by news of a lower-than-expected price index , had little influence on the dollar 's moves .
wsj_1731	7	`` The market is beginning to disassociate itself from Wall Street , '' said one New York trader .
wsj_1731	8	In late New York trading yesterday , the dollar was quoted at 1.8470 marks , down from 1.8485 marks late Wednesday , and at 141.70 yen , up from 141.45 yen late Wednesday .

wsj_1731	11	Some analysts said the consumer price index reflects a more significant slowdown in the U.S. economy than earlier indicated .
wsj_1731	12	They point out that September 's producer-price index showed a 0.9 % increase .
wsj_1731	13	They noted that because the consumer price index , known as the CPI , is a more comprehensive measure of inflation and is rising less rapidly than the producer-price index , or PPI , it could signal further easing by Fed .
wsj_1731	14	Others suggested , however , that the Fed will hold any changes in monetary policy in check , leaving fed funds at around 8 3/4 % , down from the 9 % level that prevailed from July through September .
wsj_1731	15	Kevin Logan , chief economist with the Swiss Bank Corp. , said that both PPI and CPI climbed around 4 1/2 % year-to-year in September .
wsj_1731	16	He argued that both CPI and PPI have in fact decelerated since spring .
wsj_1731	17	`` The Fed wo n't be stampeded into easing , '' Mr. Logan said , predicting that for now , interest rates will stay where they are .
wsj_1731	18	A four-day matched sale-purchase agreement , a move to drain liquidity from the system , was viewed as a technical move , rather than an indication of tightening credit .
wsj_1731	19	Market participants note that the mark continues to post heftier gains against its U.S. counterpart than any other major currency , particularly the yen .
wsj_1731	20	`` There 's a bottomless pit of dollar demand '' by Japanese investors , said Graham Beale , managing director of foreign exchange at Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp. in New York , adding that purely speculative demand would n't hold the dollar at its recent levels against the Japanese currency .

wsj_1737	1	PUTS AND CALLS , STOCK MARKET PATOIS for options to sell or buy a company 's shares , were long an arcane Wall Street art best left to the experts , who used them either as a hedge or for pure speculation .
wsj_1737	2	Options lost some of their mystery in 1973 when the Chicago Board of Trade set up a special exchange to deal in them .
wsj_1737	3	Until then , options had been traded only in the over-the-counter market , mostly in New York , and in an almost invisible secondary market operating chiefly by telephone .
wsj_1737	4	The Chicago Board of Trade , the No. 1 U.S. grain market , had long chafed under the attention won by its innovative archrival , the livestock-dealing Mercantile Exchange .
wsj_1737	5	So the men who ran the grain pits listened when Joseph Sullivan , a 35-year-old former Wall Street Journal newsman , offered them the idea of all-options trading .
wsj_1737	6	After four year of tinkering and $ 2.4 million in seed money , the board set up the new marketplace , titled it the Chicago Board Options Exchange , and named Sullivan its first president .
wsj_1737	7	The beginnings were modest .
wsj_1737	8	The CBOE opened for business on April 26 , 1973 , in what had been a Board of Trade lunchroom .
wsj_1737	9	It listed just 16 options to buy a `` pilot list '' of stocks on the New York Stock Exchange .

wsj_1737	13	The first day 's business was 911 contracts each for 100 shares of one of the listed stocks .
wsj_1737	14	By the end of 1973 , the number of `` underlying '' Big Board stocks had been increased to 50 and the options exchange had run up volume of 1.1 million contracts .
wsj_1737	15	A year later , it was 5.7 million .
wsj_1737	16	Last year , more than 1,800 traders on the CBOE bought and sold 112 million contracts on 178 listed stocks , 60 % of all U.S. listed options trading .
wsj_1737	17	The new exchange drew instant recognition from an unwelcome quarter .
wsj_1737	18	The government , campaigning against fixed brokerage commissions , promptly sued the CBOE over its minimum-fee system .
wsj_1738	0	The Nuclear Regulatory Commission ruled unanimously that the financial troubles facing the Seabrook , N.H. , nuclear-power plant have no impact on whether the plant receives a full-power license .
wsj_1738	1	Massachusetts Attorney General James Shannon , opposing the license , said he will appeal the ruling in federal court .
wsj_1738	2	Seabrook officials said the plant could receive a full-power license by the end of the year .
wsj_1738	3	The NRC rejected Mr. Shannon 's argument that Public Service Co. of New Hampshire , which owns the largest share of Seabrook , and 11 other owners are financially unable to guarantee the plant 's safe operation .
wsj_1738	4	Mr. Shannon was seeking a waiver of NRC policy that ignores financial considerations in making licensing decisions .
wsj_1738	5	In its ruling , the NRC said that because Seabrook will be allowed to charge rates sufficient to run the plant and make payments on past construction costs , consideration of the owners ' financial condition is pointless .
wsj_1738	6	`` The commissioners found the circumstances of the case did n't undercut the assurance from government rate setters of available funds adequate for safe operation , '' said a commission spokesman .
wsj_1738	7	In January 1988 , the utility filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code , allowing it to continue to operate while protected from creditors ' lawsuits .

wsj_1740	1	Sales were nearly identical to the year-earlier $ 1.36 billion .
wsj_1740	2	The drop in earnings did n't surprise analysts who said the Pittsburgh glass , coatings and chemical concern had been predicting a slow quarter because of the sluggish construction industry , a major market for the company 's flat glass .
wsj_1740	3	Glass sales to Canadian and European auto makers and sales of replacement auto glass in all markets increased .
wsj_1740	4	The coating segment also posted higher sales particularly in North America and Europe .
wsj_1740	5	But sale increases were offset by slumping sales in flat glass and fiberglass reinforcements , the company said .
wsj_1740	6	Also , chemicals sales were slightly down because of lower prices for vinyl chloride monomer and other chlorine derivatives .

wsj_1741	1	Revenue rose 15 % , to $ 36 million from $ 31.2 million .
wsj_1741	2	Jefferies , a Los Angeles holding company primarily engaged in securities trading , also said stock market declines since the quarter ended Sept. 30 created an unrealized pretax loss of about $ 6 million in its risk arbitrage account .

wsj_1743	60	Japan says its economic growth will fall sharply if it cuts back on the use of oil , coal and gas to cap emissions of carbon dioxide .
wsj_1743	61	A Ministry of International Trade and Industry official said that a study found that Japan 's annual economic growth rate would eventually be only 0.8 % if carbon-dioxide emissions remained at this year 's level of 300 million tons .
wsj_1743	62	The study will support arguments against capping carbon-dioxide emissions that Japan will make at a U.N.-backed conference on atmospheric pollution next month .

wsj_1743	64	It said that expanding nuclear-power capability is the quickest way to lessen that dependence .

wsj_1744	0	Slowing sales of its profitable Jeep Cherokee and Wagoneer sport utility vehicles are forcing Chrysler Corp. to temporarily idle its Toledo , Ohio , assembly plant for the first time since April 1986 .
wsj_1744	1	About 5,500 hourly workers will be laid off for a week beginning Oct. 23 , and overtime has been eliminated at the plant for the fourth quarter , a Chrysler spokesman said .
wsj_1744	2	That 's a significant change from earlier this year when the plant worked substantial overtime only to have sales fall short of the company 's bullish expectations .
wsj_1744	3	Sales of Cherokee , the best-selling Jeep , and the lower-volume Wagoneer were actually up about 10 % through the end of last month .
wsj_1744	4	But that 's less than Chrysler officials had hoped when they set ambitious production schedules for the Toledo plant earlier this year .
wsj_1744	5	Even when it became clear this spring that demand was n't coming up to expectations , Chrysler officials `` resisted '' cutting output because Cherokee and Wagoneer are `` very profitable vehicles , '' the spokesman said .
wsj_1744	6	Instead , Chrysler officials in late May slapped $ 1,000 cash rebates on the vehicles , including the first such incentives on the popular four-door Cherokee since Chrysler bought Jeep in 1987 .
wsj_1744	7	The incentives boosted sales for a while , but the pace had cooled by last month .
wsj_1744	8	The result : Chrysler dealers had a bloated 82-day supply of the Cherokee as of the end of last month and a 161-day supply of the Comanche pickup , which Toledo also builds .
wsj_1744	9	A 60-day to 65-day supply is considered normal .
wsj_1744	10	At Jasper Jeep-Eagle , one of the largest Jeep dealerships in the country , inventories have continued to swell .

wsj_1744	12	`` If people are n't buying , you have to close plants , '' he said .
wsj_1744	13	Separately , Chrysler said it will idle for four weeks the St. Louis assembly plant that builds the Chrysler LeBaron and Dodge Daytona models .
wsj_1744	14	Chrysler officials said the plant is scheduled to resume production on Nov. 20. , and 3,300 hourly workers will be affected .
wsj_1744	15	General Motors Corp. , meanwhile , said it will idle for yet another week its Linden , N.J. , assembly plant , bringing to three weeks the total time that plant will be idled during October .
wsj_1744	16	GM said the assembly plant , which builds the Chevrolet Corsica and Beretta compact cars , originally was scheduled to reopen Monday but now will not resume production until Oct. 30 .
wsj_1744	17	The shutdown affects 3,000 workers and will cut output by about 4,320 cars .
wsj_1744	18	Sluggish sales of the Beretta and Corsica spurred GM to offer $ 800 rebates on those cars .
wsj_1744	19	The Corsica and Beretta make up the highest-volume car line at Chevrolet , but sales of the cars are off 9.6 % for the year , and fell a steep 34.2 % early this month .
wsj_1744	20	GM has scheduled overtime at its Lordstown , Ohio , and Janesville , Wis. , assembly plants , which build the Chevrolet Cavalier .
wsj_1744	21	Ford Motor Co. said it will shut down for one week its Kentucky Truck Plant because of a `` shortage of dealer orders . ''
wsj_1744	22	The shutdown will idle 2,000 hourly employees and eliminate production of about 1,300 medium and heavy duty trucks .
wsj_1744	23	The assembly plant is scheduled to resume production on Oct. 30 .
wsj_1744	24	Meanwhile , the nine major U.S. auto makers plan to build 143,178 cars this week , down 11.7 % from 162,190 a year ago and flat with last week 's 142,117 car output .

wsj_1746	2	A year earlier , net was $ 71.6 million , or $ 1.22 a share .
wsj_1746	3	First Fidelity said non-performing assets increased to $ 482.3 million Sept. 30 from $ 393.1 million June 30 .
wsj_1746	4	The rise resulted from the transfer to non-accrual status of $ 96 million `` owed by two national borrowers and one local commercial real-estate customer , '' First Fidelity said .
wsj_1746	5	It said it does n't anticipate any loss of principal on two of the loans , comprising $ 85 million of these credits .
wsj_1746	6	First Fidelity said it boosted its loan-loss provision to $ 50.9 million from $ 20.4 million a year ago , primarily because of a weaker real-estate sector in the region .
wsj_1747	0	VIACOM Inc. 's loss narrowed to $ 21.7 million in the third quarter from $ 56.9 million a year ago .
wsj_1747	1	Thursday 's edition misstated the narrowing .
wsj_1748	0	Coastal Corp. said it signed a definitive agreement with Aruba to restart a 150,000-barrel-a-day oil refinery .
wsj_1748	1	Coastal would n't disclose the terms .
wsj_1748	2	Coastal , a Houston oil and gas company , said it expects to begin operations in October 1990 .
wsj_1748	3	The company said it may install additional processing units at the refinery to produce higher octane gasolines and other products .
wsj_1748	4	The company said it was leasing the site of the refinery from Aruba .
wsj_1748	5	Exxon Corp. built the plant but closed it in 1985 and sold off much of the equipment to dismantling contractors , from whom Coastal bought back much of the equipment .
wsj_1748	6	A Coastal spokesman said the biggest expense will be to refurbish the refinery but would n't say how much that would be .
wsj_1748	7	The prime minister of Aruba has said it could cost around $ 100 million .
wsj_1748	8	Coastal said the refinery 's expected daily production will include 34,000 barrels of jet fuel , 32,000 barrels of low-sulfur diesel fuel , 30,000 barrels of naphtha , 17,000 barrels of residual fuel oil , 8,000 barrels of asphalt and 25,000 barrels of low-sulfur catalytic cracker feedstock .
wsj_1749	0	Loral Corp. said fiscal second-quarter net income was $ 19.8 million , or 79 cents a share , compared with year-earlier earnings from continuing operations of $ 15.6 million , or 62 cents a share .
wsj_1749	1	Year-earlier net of $ 21 million , or 84 cents a share , included the results of Loral 's former Aircraft Braking Systems and Engineered Fabrics divisions , which were sold April 27 to the company 's chairman , Bernard L. Schwartz .
wsj_1749	2	The defense electronics concern attributed the operating improvement to higher profit margins and lower net interest expense .
wsj_1749	3	Loral also reported that its bookings more than doubled to $ 654 million in the quarter , ended Sept. 30 , from $ 257 million , in the year-before period .
wsj_1749	4	The increase was due mainly to a $ 325 million order from Turkey to equip its fleet of F-16 fighters with Loral 's ALQ-178 Rapport III electronic countermeasures system .
wsj_1749	5	The order is the biggest in the company 's history .
wsj_1749	6	Sales in the latest period edged up to $ 295.7 million from $ 293.9 million .
wsj_1749	7	Mr. Schwartz said the recent increase in orders `` puts us well on the way to our goal of $ 1.6 billion in bookings for the year . ''
wsj_1749	8	He added : `` I expect to see the earnings momentum we experienced this quarter continue for the rest of the year . ''
wsj_1749	9	Loral said it expects sales to accelerate in both the third and fourth quarters of this fiscal year .
wsj_1749	10	Loral 's profit from continuing operations for the first six months of fiscal 1990 was $ 36.4 million , or $ 1.44 a share , up 31 % from $ 27.8 million , or $ 1.11 a share , a year earlier .
wsj_1749	11	Net income fell 8.6 % to $ 37.1 million , or $ 1.43 a share , from $ 40.6 million , or $ 1.56 a share .
wsj_1749	12	Fiscal first-half sales slipped 3.9 % to $ 528.4 million from $ 549.9 million .
wsj_1749	13	Bookings for the first half totaled $ 813 million , compared with the $ 432 million recorded last year .
wsj_1749	14	In New York Stock Exchange composite trading , Loral closed at $ 33.25 , down 37.5 cents .
wsj_1750	0	HealthVest said two of its lenders have given it notices of default on bank loans and said they may take actions to recover their loans .
wsj_1750	1	HealthVest , an Austin , Texas , real estate investment trust , said that Chemical Bank , the lead bank under its domestic bank agreement , told it that if $ 3.3 million owed to the bank group is n't paid by today , the group will call the $ 120 million that HealthVest has outstanding under the credit line .
wsj_1750	2	The bank group also said that it wo n't make additional advances under the $ 150 million credit line .
wsj_1750	3	HealthVest missed a payment to the group that was due in late September .
wsj_1750	4	In addition , HealthVest said Bank of Tokyo Trust Co. also has notified it of a default and said it might take action to cure the default .
wsj_1750	5	HealthVest missed an interest payment to Bank of Tokyo on Oct. 1 .
wsj_1750	6	However , HealthVest said the Tokyo bank indicated that it wo n't accelerate HealthVest 's $ 50 million loan .
wsj_1750	7	HealthVest is in a severe liquidity bind because its affiliate , Healthcare International Inc. , has failed to make about $ 10.6 million in principal and interest payments owed since August .
wsj_1750	8	Healthcare operates many of the health-care properties that HealthVest owns .
wsj_1751	0	EMPIRE PENCIL , later called Empire-Berol , developed the plastic pencil in 1973 .

wsj_1752	0	Storage Technology Corp. had net income of $ 8.3 million , or 32 cents a share , for its fiscal-third quarter ended Sept. 29 , almost 15 times the $ 557,000 , or two cents a share , it posted for the year-ago period .
wsj_1752	1	Storage , Louisville , Colo. , which makes data-storage devices for mainframe computers , said the huge increase in net reflects `` strong sales '' of its tape products , particularly the 4400 Automated Cartridge System , which holds a library of tape cartridges .
wsj_1752	2	The company said it recently sold its 750th cartridge system , which cost $ 400,000 to $ 500,000 each .
wsj_1752	3	Quarter revenue was $ 232.6 million , up 12 % from $ 206 million last year .
wsj_1752	4	The stock market reacted strongly to the news .
wsj_1752	5	Storage rose $ 1.125 a share , to close at $ 14 , in New York Stock Exchange composite trading .
wsj_1752	6	For the nine months , Storage had net of $ 25.5 million , or 98 cents a share , including an $ 11.3 million extraordinary gain for the anticipated proceeds from liquidating an Irish unit .
wsj_1752	7	Net was up 69 % from $ 15.1 million , or 57 cents a share , last year .
wsj_1752	8	Revenue for the latest period was up 11 % to $ 682.7 million , from $ 614.6 million .
wsj_1753	0	A Canadian government agency conditionally approved proposed exports to the U.S. of natural gas from big , untapped fields in the Mackenzie River delta area of the western Canadian Arctic .
wsj_1753	1	Three companies , Esso Resources Canada Ltd. , Shell Canada Ltd. and Gulf Canada Resources Ltd. , applied to the Canadian National Energy Board to export 9.2 trillion cubic feet of Mackenzie delta natural gas over 20 years starting in 1996 .
wsj_1753	2	To be economically feasible , the 11 billion Canadian dollar US$ 9.37 billion project requires almost a doubling of natural gas export prices .
wsj_1753	3	It also faces numerous other hurdles including an agreement on a pipeline route for the gas .
wsj_1753	4	The board said the export licenses would be issued on the condition that Canadian interests would also be allowed to bid for the Mackenzie delta gas on terms similar to those offered to U.S. customers .
wsj_1753	5	U.S. buyers have already been lined up .
wsj_1753	6	They include Enron Corp. , Texas Eastern Corp. , Pacific Interstate Transmission Co. and Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co .
wsj_1753	7	The project could result in the U.S. taking more than 10 % of its natural gas supplies from Canada , up from about 5 % currently .
wsj_1753	8	It would bring 13 gas fields into production at a combined rate of about 1.2 billion cubic feet a day .
wsj_1753	9	The board estimated that the cost of building a pipeline from the Mackenzie delta to Alberta would be about C$ 5.9 million .
wsj_1753	10	It also said projections of surging U.S. demand for natural gas and price forecasts of C$ 5.25 per thousand cubic feet by 2005 would make the project economically viable .
wsj_1753	11	Esso , a unit of Imperial Oil Ltd. which is 71%-owned by Exxon Corp. , will be allowed to export 5.1 trillion cubic feet to the U.S. in the 20-year period .
wsj_1753	12	Shell , a subsidiary of Royal Dutch/Shell Group , will be allowed to export 0.9 trillion cubic feet , and Gulf , a unit of Olympia & York Developments Ltd. will be allowed to export 3.2 trillion cubic feet .
wsj_1754	0	Combustion Engineering Inc. , Stamford , Conn. , said it sold and agreed to sell several investments and nonstrategic businesses for about $ 100 million , which will be used for reducing debt and general purposes .
wsj_1754	1	The transactions are unrelated .
wsj_1754	2	The company agreed to sell its minority investments in makers of steam-generating and related equipment , Stein Industrie and Energie & Verfahrenstechnik , to the major shareholder in the companies , Dutch-based GEC Alsthom N.V .
wsj_1754	3	Combustion Engineering , which provides engineered products , systems and services for power generation , also sold Illinois Minerals Co. , based in Cairo , Ill .
wsj_1754	4	That unit of its Georgia Kaolin Co. subsidiary was sold to a unit of Unimin Corp .
wsj_1754	5	Assets of Construction Equipment International , Houston , were sold to Essex Crane Inc. , and the assets of Elgin Electronics , Erie , Pa. , were sold to closely held Charter Technologies Inc .
wsj_1755	0	Where do Americans put their money ?
wsj_1755	1	It depends on when you look .
wsj_1755	2	In 1900 , for instance , less than 8 % of assets went into bank deposits .
wsj_1755	3	That rose to nearly 18 % during the Depression , and has n't changed much since .
wsj_1755	4	Pension reserves , on the other hand , made up a relatively small part of household assets until the last decade , when they skyrocketed .
wsj_1755	5	And there has been a drastic decline in the importance of unincorporated business assets -- thanks to industry consolidation and a decline in family farms .
wsj_1755	6	That 's some of what emerges from the following charts , which show how Americans have changed their investment patterns over the past 90 years .
wsj_1755	7	Some results are self-explanatory .
wsj_1755	8	But other figures are surprising .
wsj_1755	9	Housing , for instance , has remained a fairly steady component of household assets over the past decade -- although common wisdom would have expected an increase .
wsj_1755	10	`` There is a lot of attention paid to housing as a form of household wealth , '' says Edward N. Wolff , professor of economics at New York University .
wsj_1755	11	`` But it has n't increased much relative to other assets .
wsj_1755	12	It suggests that households accumulate wealth across a broad spectrum of assets .
wsj_1755	13	And housing though it appears in the popular mind as being the major growing household asset , is n't . ''
wsj_1755	14	In addition , investors ' desire to hold stocks -- directly and through mutual funds -- has held surprisingly steady ; stocks ' importance among assets largely reflects the ups and downs of the stock market , and not a shift in stock-holding preferences .
wsj_1755	15	`` Stocks have not spread to the general public , despite the fact that the environment is much different , '' concludes Robert Avery , an economist at Cornell University .
wsj_1755	16	`` To me it says that despite all the views that we spend too much of our wealth on paper assets , we have ways of holding wealth similar to 100 years ago . ''
wsj_1755	17	-- The charts show how househld assets have been distributed over time .
wsj_1755	18	The main components of the various asseet categories : Housing : Primary home , but not the land it 's on .
wsj_1755	19	Land and Other Real Estate : Land on which primary home is built , investment property .
wsj_1755	20	Consumer Durables : Automobiles , appliances , furniture .
wsj_1755	21	Bank Deposits : Currency , checking-account deposits , small savings and time deposits , certificates of deposits , money-market fund shares .
wsj_1755	22	Bonds : Excludes bond funds .
wsj_1755	23	Stocks/Mutual Funds : Stocks and mutual funds other than money-market funds .
wsj_1755	24	Unincorporated Business : Partnerships and sole proprietorships , professional corporations .
wsj_1755	25	Pension Reserves : Holdings by pension funds .
wsj_1756	0	McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. said it sent a letter to LIN Broadcasting Corp. clarifying its revised tender offer for LIN and asking LIN to conduct `` a fair auction . ''
wsj_1756	1	The letter apparently came in response to a request for clarification by LIN earlier this week .
wsj_1756	2	LIN , which has agreed with BellSouth Corp. to merge their cellular-telephone businesses , said then that it would n't take a position on McCaw 's revised tender offer .
wsj_1756	3	Earlier this month , McCaw revised its offer to $ 125 a share for 22 million LIN shares .
wsj_1756	4	McCaw is seeking 50.3 % of the cellular and broadcasting concern ; the revised offer includes a feature requiring McCaw to begin an auction process in July 1994 that would buy out remaining holders at a per-share price roughly equivalent to what a third party might then have to pay for all of LIN .
wsj_1756	5	The letter outlines broad powers for an independent group of directors provided for in the revised offer .
wsj_1756	6	In a statement , Craig O. McCaw , chairman and chief executive officer of McCaw , said : `` We trust LIN will take no further actions that favor BellSouth . ''
wsj_1756	7	McCaw said the three independent directors provided for in the offer would be designated by the current board .
wsj_1756	8	The successors would be nominated by the independent directors .
wsj_1756	9	LIN would have a priority right to pursue all opportunities to acquire U.S. cellular interests in markets other than those in which McCaw holds an interest , or which are contiguous to those markets , unless LIN has an interest there or contiguous to it .
wsj_1756	10	Independent directors would have veto rights to any acquisition if they unanimously decide it is n't in LIN 's best interest .
wsj_1756	11	Independent directors would be able to block transactions they unanimously deem would be likely to depress the private market value of LIN at the time it is to be sold in five years .
wsj_1756	12	If LIN is put up for sale rather than purchased by McCaw in five years , McCaw wo n't submit a bid unless the independent directors request it , and the independent directors will run the bidding .
wsj_1756	13	The directors would be able to sell particular assets to enable such buyers as the regional Bell operating companies to purchase the company 's interests .
wsj_1757	0	MCA Inc. said third-quarter net fell 6.3 % to $ 50.8 million , or 69 cents a share , from $ 54.3 million , or 74 cents a share , a year earlier .
wsj_1757	1	MCA said revenue rose 14 % to $ 918.4 million from $ 806.7 million .
wsj_1757	2	The entertainment concern said the success of several movies released during the quarter , including `` Parenthood '' and `` Uncle Buck , '' contributed to record revenue for its film unit .
wsj_1757	3	Both MCA 's music-entertainment and book-publishing units also posted record revenue and operating profit .
wsj_1757	4	The parent company 's net included a loss -- which it did n't specify -- that was related to the company 's 50 % stake in Cineplex Odeon Corp .
wsj_1757	5	Cineplex , a Toronto theater chain , had a second-quarter net loss of $ 38.7 million .
wsj_1757	6	MCA said net also included certain reserves related to the restructuring of its LJN Toys ' international operations .
wsj_1757	7	These items were partly offset , MCA said , by an unspecified gain on the sale of its Miller International unit , a maker and distributor of budget-priced audio cassettes .
wsj_1757	8	In New York Stock Exchange composite trading , MCA rose $ 1.50 to $ 64 .
wsj_1757	9	In the nine months , net rose 35 % to $ 120.1 million , or $ 1.64 a share , from $ 89.2 million , or $ 1.22 a share , a year earlier .

wsj_1762	1	The union on Oct. 5 requested that the contract be reopened to restore all pay and benefits that the union gave up in the 1982-83 and 1986-87 rounds of bargaining .
wsj_1762	2	A United Steelworkers spokeman said Lynn Williams , the union 's president , was out of town .
wsj_1762	3	The union wo n't respond to the USX statement until Mr. Williams has studied it , the spokesman said .
wsj_1763	0	Robert A. Oswald , chief financial officer and a director of this natural-gas pipeline company , was elected to the additional position of executive vice president .

wsj_1763	2	The appointments take effect Nov. 1 .
wsj_1763	3	Both men are 44 years old .
wsj_1764	0	This magazine and book publisher said three men were elected directors , increasing the board to 10 .

wsj_1766	0	International Business Machines Corp. will announce on Tuesday a slew of software products aimed at eliminating some of the major problems involved in computerizing manufacturing operations , industry executives said .
wsj_1766	1	Many plant floors currently resemble a Tower of Babel , with computers , robots and machine tools that generally speak their own language and have trouble talking to each other .
wsj_1766	2	As a result , if a problem develops on a production line , it is unlikely some supervisor sitting in front of a personal computer or workstation will know about it or be able to correct it .
wsj_1766	3	So IBM will be announcing more than 50 products that will be aimed at letting even the dumbest machine tool talk to the smartest mainframe , or anything in between .
wsj_1766	4	In an unusual display of openness , IBM also will be helping customers tie together operations that include lots of equipment made by IBM 's competitors .
wsj_1766	5	In addition , the executives said IBM will be offering programming tools designed to let anyone working on a factory floor write ad-hoc software , for instance , to do statistical analysis that would pinpoint a problem on a manufacturing line .
wsj_1766	6	In Armonk , N.Y. , an IBM spokeswoman confirmed that IBM executives will be announcing some computer-integrated-manufacturing plans next week but declined to elaborate .
wsj_1766	7	The industry executives said that , as usual with such broad announcements from IBM , this one will be part reality and part strategy .
wsj_1766	8	So it will take many quarters for IBM to roll out all the products that customers need , and it will take years for customers to integrate the products into their operations .
wsj_1766	9	Also as usual , the products will appeal mostly to heavy users of IBM equipment , at least initially .
wsj_1766	10	Still , consultants and industry executives said the products could help make manufacturing operations more efficient , and provide a boost to the computer-integrated-manufacturing market -- a market that Yankee Group , a research firm , has said may double to $ 40 billion by 1993 .
wsj_1766	11	`` This is a step in the right direction , '' said Martin Piszczalski , a Yankee Group analyst .
wsj_1766	12	He added , though , that `` a lot of this is intentions ... .
wsj_1766	13	We 'll have to wait and see '' how the plan develops .
wsj_1766	14	The announcements also should help IBM go on the offensive against Digital Equipment Corp. on the plant floor .
wsj_1766	15	While IBM has traditionally dominated the market for computers on the business side of manufacturing operations and has done well in the market for design tools , Digital has dominated computerized manufacturing .
wsj_1766	16	Hewlett-Packard Co. also has begun to gain share in the whole computer-integrated-manufacturing arena .
wsj_1766	17	IBM will face an uphill climb against Digital , given Digital 's reputation for being better than IBM at hooking together different manufacturers ' computers .
wsj_1766	18	In addition , Hewlett-Packard , while a much smaller player , has made a big commitment to the sorts of industry standards that facilitate those hookups and could give IBM some problems .
wsj_1766	19	Both can be expected to go after the market aggressively : Gartner Group Inc. , a research firm , estimated the Digital gets 30 % of its revenue from the manufacturing market , and Hewlett-Packard gets 50 % .
wsj_1766	20	IBM , which Gartner Group said generates 22 % of its revenue in this market , should be able to take advantage of its loyal following among buyers of equipment .
wsj_1766	21	That is because many companies will standardize on certain types of equipment as the various parts of the manufacturing market merge , and IBM is the biggest player .
wsj_1766	22	But much will depend on how quickly IBM can move .
wsj_1766	23	The whole idea of computer-integrated manufacturing , CIM , seems to be making a comeback after losing a little luster over the past couple of years when it became apparent that it was n't a panacea that would make U.S. plants more efficient and banish foreign competition .
wsj_1766	24	Erik Keller , a Gartner Group analyst , said organizational changes may still be required to really take advantage of CIM 's capabilities -- someone on the shop floor may not like having someone in an office using a personal computer to look over his shoulder , for instance , and may be able to prevent that from happening .
wsj_1766	25	But he said a system such as IBM 's should help significantly .
wsj_1766	26	In making polyethylene sheets out of plastic chips , for instance , a chip sometimes does n't melt , gets caught in the machinery and creates a run in the sheets .
wsj_1766	27	That can be expensive , because the problem may not be noticed for a while , and the sheets are typically thrown away .
wsj_1766	28	But Mr. Keller said that , if computers can be integrated into the process , they could alert an operator as soon as the problem occurred .
wsj_1766	29	They could also check through the orders on file to find a customer that was willing to accept a lower grade of polyethylene .
wsj_1766	30	The computer would let the machine run just until that order was filled , eliminating waste .
wsj_1766	31	This sort of improved link figures to eventually become a significant weapon for some companies .
wsj_1766	32	Companies might be able to tell salespeople daily , for instance , about idle equipment , so they could offer discounts on whatever that equipment produces .
wsj_1766	33	Salespeople also could get a precise reading on when products could be delivered -- in much the same way that Federal Express has marketed its ability to tell exactly where a package is in the delivery system .
wsj_1768	0	Canadian Pacific Ltd. said it proposed acquiring the 44 % of Soo Line Corp. it does n't already own for $ 19.50 a share , or about $ 81.9 million , after failing to find a buyer for its majority stake earlier this year .
wsj_1768	1	Soo Line said its board appointed a special committee of independent directors to study the proposal .
wsj_1768	2	The troubled Minneapolis-based railroad concern said the committee has the authority to hire financial and legal advisers to assist it .
wsj_1768	3	The proposed acquisition will be subject to approval by the Interstate Commerce Commission , Soo Line said .
wsj_1768	4	In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , Soo Line shares jumped well above the proposed price , closing at $ 20.25 , up $ 2.75 .
wsj_1768	5	Canadian Pacific put its 56 % stake in Soo Line up for sale last year but could n't find any takers .
wsj_1768	6	Canadian Pacific , which has interests in transportation , telecommunications , forest products , energy and real estate , finally took its majority block off the market this spring .
wsj_1768	7	`` It turned out we could n't sell it , '' a Canadian Pacific official said , adding that acquiring the remainder of Soo Line is now `` the best way to rationalize operations . ''
wsj_1768	8	Canadian Pacific is Soo Line 's biggest customer and has owned a majority stake in the U.S. railroad since 1947 .
wsj_1768	9	Canadian Pacific and Soo Line tracks connect at two points in the West on the Canada-U.S. border and the two companies operate a very successful Chicago-Montreal rail service .
wsj_1768	10	Separately , for the first nine months , Soo Line reported a loss of $ 398,000 , or four cents a share , compared with net income of $ 12.5 million , or $ 1.32 a share , a year earlier .
wsj_1768	11	Revenue fell 5.8 % to $ 407.9 million from $ 433.2 million .
wsj_1768	12	The company had a loss from operations of $ 1.7 million .
wsj_1769	0	Golden Nugget Inc. reported a third-quarter net loss of $ 13.1 million , or 76 cents a share , based on 17.2 million common shares and dilutive equivalents outstanding .
wsj_1769	1	The results compare with a year-earlier net loss of $ 1.5 million , or seven cents a share , based on 20.3 million common and dilutive equivalents outstanding .
wsj_1769	2	Operating revenue rose 25 % to $ 52.1 million from $ 41.8 million a year ago .
wsj_1769	3	Results for the latest quarter include nonoperating items of $ 23.9 million , versus $ 8.4 million a year earlier .
wsj_1769	4	Most of the expenses stem from the company 's huge Mirage resort-casino scheduled to open next month along the Strip , and an April 1989 financing by units operating the downtown Golden Nugget property .
wsj_1769	5	For the nine months , Golden Nugget reported a net loss of $ 11.4 million , or 69 cents a share , based on 16.6 million common and dilutive equivalents outstanding .

wsj_1769	10	John Uphoff , an analyst with Raymond James & Associates , said the results were n't surprising , and attributed the buy-back to management 's confidence in the Mirage 's ability to generate strong cash flow in 1990 .

wsj_1770	0	Capital Holding Corp. said it requested and received the resignation of John A. Franco , its vice chairman , as an officer and a director of the life insurance holding company .
wsj_1770	1	The company said Mr. Franco developed a plan to establish a business that might be competitive with Capital Holding Corp. 's Accumulation and Investment Group , which Mr. Franco headed .
wsj_1770	2	The group temporarily will report to Irving W. Bailey II , chairman , president and chief executive officer of Capital Holding .
wsj_1770	3	Mr. Franco , 47 years old , said in a telephone interview that he has been considering and discussing a number of possible business ventures , but that `` nothing is at a mature stage . ''
wsj_1770	4	He said he `` did n't argue with '' the company 's decision to seek his resignation because contemplating outside business ventures can distract an executive from performing his best `` at the job he is paid to do . ''
wsj_1770	5	Martin H. Ruby , a managing director of Capital Holding 's Accumulation and Investment Group , also resigned to pursue other business interests , Capital Holding said .
wsj_1770	6	Mr. Ruby , 39 , said that he had `` an amicable parting '' with Capital Holding and that he has `` a number of ventures in the financial-services area '' under consideration .
wsj_1770	7	He said that his resignation was a mutual decision with Capital Holding management , but that he was n't actually asked to resign .
wsj_1770	8	The Accumulation and Investment Group is responsible for the investment operations of all Capital Holding 's insurance businesses and markets guaranteed investment contracts to bank trust departments and other institutions .

wsj_1772	1	PLASTIC PENCILS , CODE-NAMED E-71 , made their hush-hush debut in children 's pencil boxes at five-and-dime stores in 1973 .
wsj_1772	2	But few knew it then and most still think all pencils are wooden .
wsj_1772	3	Eagle Pencil of Shelbyville , Tenn. , `` Pencil City U.S.A. , '' had made its earliest pilot plastic pencils in 1971 .
wsj_1772	4	But it was n't until after it hired Arthur D. Little , a Cambridge , Mass. , research concern , that its new product was refined for commercial sale in 1973 .
wsj_1772	5	Three A.D.L. inventors applied April 6 , 1973 , for the patent , which was assigned and awarded in 1976 to Hasbro Industries , then Eagle 's parent .
wsj_1772	6	Pencil pushers chew and put the plastic models behind their ears just like traditional pencils made of glued strips of California incense cedar filled with ceramic lead .
wsj_1772	7	It takes five steps to make standard pencils , just one for the plastic type .
wsj_1772	8	Automated machines coextrude long plastic sheaths with graphite-plastic cores that are printed , cut , painted and eraser-fitted .
wsj_1772	9	`` After more than 200 years , something new has happened to pencils , '' said Arthur D. Little in a 1974 report that publicly described the previously secret item .
wsj_1772	10	Eagle 's plastic type sharpens and looks like a wooden pencil .
wsj_1772	11	A major difference is that a snapped wooden pencil will have a slivered break while a plastic model will break cleanly .
wsj_1772	12	The softness of the core constrains the plastic models to No. 1 , No. 2 or No. 3-type pencils , which account for the bulk of the market .
wsj_1772	13	Artists and draftsmen need harder `` leads . ''
wsj_1772	14	Eagle , now called Eagle-Berol , remains a leading company among the 10 in the U.S. that produced about 2.3 billion pencils last year , according to the Pencil Makers Association .
wsj_1772	15	It 's a trade secret how many were plastic , and most writers still do n't know what they 're using .
wsj_1773	0	H.F. Ahmanson & Co. , the nation 's largest thrift holding company , posted a 12 % earnings decline for the third quarter while another large California savings and loan , Great Western Financial Corp. , reported a slight earnings gain .
wsj_1773	1	H.F. Ahmanson , parent of Home Savings of America , reported third-quarter net of $ 49.2 million , or 50 cents a share , down from $ 56.1 million , or 57 cents a share , in the year-earlier period .
wsj_1773	2	Most of the earnings decline reflected an increase in the company 's effective tax rate to 44 % from 37 % in the year-ago third quarter when nonrecurring tax credits were recorded , the company said .
wsj_1773	3	Pretax earnings declined 1.3 % .
wsj_1773	4	For the nine months , Los Angeles-based H.F. Ahmanson had profit of $ 128.1 million , or $ 1.29 a share , a 4.6 % decline from earnings of $ 134.2 million in the year-ago nine months .
wsj_1773	5	The company said the decline was attributable to a 79 % reduction in net gains on loan sales this year .
wsj_1773	6	Third-quarter spreads widened to the highest level in two years as loan portfolio yields rose and money costs declined , the company said .
wsj_1773	7	Great Western Financial said third-quarter profit rose slightly to $ 68.4 million , or 52 cents a share , from $ 67.9 million , or 53 cents a share , from a year ago .
wsj_1773	8	Great Western , based in Beverly Hills , Calif. , is a financial services firm and parent to Great Western Bank , an S&L .
wsj_1773	9	Great Western said it had a sharp increase in margins in the recent third quarter .
wsj_1773	10	Margins are the difference between the yield on the company 's earning assets and its own cost of funds .
wsj_1773	11	But a reduction in one-time gains on the sale of various assets and an increase in the company 's provision for loan losses held down the earnings gain , the company said .
wsj_1773	12	Great Western 's provision for loan losses was increased to $ 27.9 million for the recent quarter compared with $ 21.8 million a year ago primarily as a result of `` continued weakness in various commercial and multifamily real estate markets outside California . ''
wsj_1773	13	For the nine months Great Western posted net of $ 177.5 million , or $ 1.37 a share , a 5.9 % decline from $ 188.7 million , or $ 1.48 a share , in the year-ago period .

wsj_1776	0	Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp. said it decided to proceed with installation of automatic gauge and shape controls at its 60-inch tandem cold rolling mill in Allenport , Pa .
wsj_1776	1	The new equipment , which will produce steel sheet with more uniform thickness and flatness , is likely to cost more than $ 20 million , the company said .
wsj_1776	2	When the company last considered adding the equipment two years ago , it estimated the cost at $ 21 million to $ 22 million , but a task force will have to prepare a detailed plan before the company can predict the current cost .

wsj_1779	0	Georgia-Pacific Corp. , exceeding some analysts ' expectations , said third-quarter earnings rose 56 % to $ 178 million , or $ 2.03 a share , from $ 114 million , or $ 1.19 a share , in the year-earlier period .
wsj_1779	1	Sales increased 10 % to $ 2.65 billion from $ 2.41 billion .
wsj_1779	2	Per-share earnings were enhanced by the company 's share buy-back program , which reduced the average shares outstanding to 87.5 million in the quarter from 95.8 million in the same quarter of 1988 .
wsj_1779	3	With strong prices in the company 's two major areas -- building products as well as pulp and paper -- analysts had expected a roaring quarter .
wsj_1779	4	But the performance exceeded some estimates of around $ 1.90 a share .
wsj_1779	5	Fueling the growth , among other things , were higher-than-expected prices for certain building products .
wsj_1779	6	One reason : efforts to protect the spotted owl led to restrictions on logging in the Pacific Northwest , constricting supply and forcing prices up .
wsj_1779	7	Another reason : strikes , both at Georgia-Pacific and other lumber companies also cut supplies and raised prices , analysts said .
wsj_1779	8	For the nine months , Georgia-Pacific 's earnings increased 49 % to $ 504 million , or $ 5.58 a share , from $ 338 million , or $ 3.41 a share .
wsj_1779	9	Sales rose 11 % to $ 7.73 billion from $ 6.94 billion .

wsj_1782	0	Housing construction sank in September to its lowest level since the last recession , the Commerce Department reported .
wsj_1782	1	Work began on homes and apartments at an annual rate of 1,263,000 units last month , down 5.2 % from August , the department said .
wsj_1782	2	The September decline followed an even steeper drop of 6.2 % in August and left housing starts at their weakest since October 1982 , when the country was nearing the end of a recession .
wsj_1782	3	Originally the department had reported the August decline as 5 % .
wsj_1782	4	The numbers suggest that the housing industry is still suffering the effects of the Federal Reserve 's battle against inflation .
wsj_1782	5	The industry had shown signs of recovery this summer , after the central bank began to relax its clamp on credit , allowing interest rates to drop a bit after pushing them up for a year .
wsj_1782	6	Sales of new homes rose and inventories of houses , which had been climbing , dropped .
wsj_1782	7	But last month new construction in all types of homes waned , from single-family houses to large apartment complexes .
wsj_1782	8	`` It 's pretty much weak across the board , '' said Martin Regalia , chief economist of the National Council of Savings Institutions .
wsj_1782	9	Mr. Regalia said the industry may be reluctant to step up building at the moment for fear the inventories of unsold homes will increase again .
wsj_1782	10	Another reason for the weakness , he said , may be that mortgage rates have hit a plateau since they began edging down after a peak in March .
wsj_1782	11	In August , rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages started creeping up a bit , but they inched down again through September .
wsj_1782	12	`` Rates have n't really peeled off that much , '' Mr. Regalia said .
wsj_1782	13	`` We 've kind of settled now into an interest-rate environment that 's fairly high . ''
wsj_1782	14	Work was begun on single family homes -- the core of the housing market -- at an annual rate of 971,000 in September , a drop of 2.1 % from the previous month .
wsj_1782	15	That followed a 3.3 % decline in August .
wsj_1782	16	Construction of apartments and other multi-family dwellings slipped 2.2 % to an annual rate of 1,022,000 following a 3.5 % decline in August .
wsj_1782	17	The number of building permits issued for future construction dropped 2.4 % to a 1,296,000 annual rate after rising 3.7 % in August .
wsj_1782	18	All the numbers were adjusted for normal seasonal variations in building activity .
wsj_1782	19	The housing starts numbers , however , are one of the least precise of the government 's economic indicators and are often revised significantly as more information is collected .
wsj_1783	0	Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc. posted a sharp third-quarter turnaround from a year earlier , but net income would have dropped from the second quarter without a $ 37 million after-tax gain .
wsj_1783	1	The securities firm posted third-quarter net of $ 66 million , or 64 cents a share , compared with a restated year-earlier loss of $ 3 million , or 11 cents a share .
wsj_1783	2	Revenue climbed 25 % to $ 3.3 billion from $ 2.6 billion .
wsj_1783	3	The latest period included the gain , which was $ 77 million before tax , from the previously announced sale of the institutional money management business of Lehman Management Co .
wsj_1783	4	The 1988 period was restated from net income of $ 8 million to correct an overstatement in the company 's Boston Co. subsidiary .
wsj_1783	5	In the 1989 second quarter , Shearson had net income of $ 55 million , or 54 cents a share .
wsj_1783	6	An average 102.5 million common shares were outstanding in the latest quarter , up from 87.1 million .
wsj_1783	7	In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , Shearson shares lost 37.5 cents to $ 18.125 .
wsj_1783	8	The company said the improved performance from a year ago reflects higher commissions and revenue from marketmaking and trading for its own account .
wsj_1783	9	Commission revenue was $ 522 million , up 49 % .
wsj_1783	10	But industrywide trading activity slowed in September as institutional investors turned cautious and individuals continued to shy away from the market .
wsj_1783	11	Investment banking revenue fell 32 % to $ 205 million , in part reflecting the continued slowdown of the underwriting business .
wsj_1783	12	In the nine months , net fell 3 % to $ 106 million , or 98 cents a share , from $ 110 million , or $ 1.05 a share .
wsj_1783	13	Revenue advanced 26 % to $ 9.6 billion from $ 7.6 billion .
wsj_1784	0	Two major drug companies posted strong third-quarter earnings , in line with profits already reported by industry leaders and analysts ' expectations .
wsj_1784	1	But Pfizer Inc. , based in New York , reported flat earnings .
wsj_1784	2	Schering-Plough Corp. , based in Madison , N.J. , reported a 21 % rise in earnings as American Home Products Corp. of New York posted an 11 % increase in net .
wsj_1784	3	American Home Products said sales and earnings for the third quarter and nine months were at record levels .
wsj_1784	4	Sales for the third quarter increased 6.5 % to $ 1.51 billion from $ 1.42 billion .
wsj_1784	5	Sales of health-care products increased 6 % in the third quarter , based in part on strong sales of prescription drugs such as Premarin , an estrogen-replacement drug , and sales of the company 's infant formula .
wsj_1784	6	American Home Products said net income benefited from a `` lower effective tax rate , '' reflecting a reduction of foreign tax rates , and additional operations in Puerto Rico .
wsj_1784	7	Net also was aided by a gain on the sale of the company 's equity interests in South Africa effective Sept. 1 .
wsj_1784	8	In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , American Home Products closed at $ 102.25 a share , down 75 cents .
wsj_1784	9	Pfizer said third-quarter sales increased 4 % to $ 1.44 billion from $ 1.38 billion .
wsj_1784	10	The company said net income was flat because of investment in research and development and costs related to launches of several products .
wsj_1784	11	The company said the dollar 's continued strengthening reduced world-wide sales growth by three percentage points .
wsj_1784	12	Pfizer posted its largest gains in healthcare sales , up 3 % , and consumer products , up 23 % .
wsj_1784	13	Sales by the specialty chemicals and materials science segments were flat , and sales by the agriculture segment declined 5 % .
wsj_1784	14	In the health-care segment , pharmaceutical sales increased 4 % and sales of hospital products increased 1 % .
wsj_1784	15	During the quarter , Pfizer received federal approval of Procardia XL , a calcium channel blocker approved for both angina and hypertension , and Monorail Piccolino , used to open obstructed coronary arteries .
wsj_1784	16	In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , Pfizer closed at $ 67.75 a share , up 75 cents .
wsj_1784	17	Schering-Plough said sales gained 2.7 % to $ 743.7 million from $ 724.4 million .
wsj_1784	18	In the period , the company completed the sale of its European cosmetics businesses , sold a majority interest in its Brazilian affiliate , and announced the reorganization of its over-the-counter drug businesses into a new unit , Schering-Plough Health Care Products .
wsj_1784	19	These actions did n't affect results because the gain on the sale of the European cosmetics businesses was offset by provisions relating to the Brazil divestiture and drug restructuring .
wsj_1784	20	U.S. pharmaceutical sales rose 15 % , led by allergy , asthma and cold products ; dermatological products ; anti-infectives and anti-cancer products ; and cardiovascular products .
wsj_1784	21	World-wide consumer product sales declined 12 % , primarily because of the European cosmetics sale .
wsj_1784	22	Significantly lower sales of ` Stay Trim ' diet aids also were a factor in the drop .
wsj_1784	23	The Maybelline beauty product line had higher sales following a sluggish first half .
wsj_1784	24	In Big Board composite trading , Schering-Plough shares fell 75 cents to close at $ 74.125 .
wsj_1785	0	Swedish auto and aerospace concern Saab-Scania AB said it received a 250 million krona $ 39 million order from Swiss Crossair , one of Europe 's leading regional air companies , for five Saab 340B turboprop commuter aircraft .
wsj_1786	0	It is quite unfortunate that you failed so miserably in reporting the Hurricane Hugo disaster .
wsj_1786	1	Your Sept. 27 page-one article `` Charleston Lost Quite a Lot to Hugo , Especially Gentility '' leaves the impression that the storm was little more than an inconvenience .
wsj_1786	2	The damage reported focused on a select few who owned irreplaceable historic homes on the Battery .
wsj_1786	3	Not mentioned were the 50,000 people rendered homeless , and the more than 200,000 out of work for an indeterminable period ; the $ 1 billion-plus in losses to homes and personal property on the barrier islands ; the near - and long-term impact on the state 's largest industry , tourism , not to mention the human suffering .
wsj_1786	4	In centering on the disruption of a few proud local customs such as the historic homes tour and the damage to the antiquities , your reporter served to only perpetuate an outdated and stereotypically provincial view of this otherwise thriving port city .

wsj_1792	0	British Airways PLC said it is seeking improved terms and a sharply lower price in any revised bid for United Airlines parent UAL Corp. following the collapse of a $ 6.79 billion , $ 300-a-share buy-out bid .
wsj_1792	1	Derek Stevens , British Air 's chief financial officer , told Dow Jones Professional Investor Report a price of $ 230 a share is `` certainly not too low , '' and indicated his company would like to reduce the size of its $ 750 million cash investment .
wsj_1792	2	He added the airline is n't committed to going forward with any new bid , and has n't participated in bankers ' efforts to revive the transaction that collapsed .
wsj_1792	3	`` We 're in no way committed to a deal going through at all .
wsj_1792	4	We 're not rushing into anything .
wsj_1792	5	We do n't want to be party to a second rejection , '' he said , adding that coming up with a revised offer could easily take several weeks .
wsj_1792	6	Mr. Stevens 's remarks , confirming a report in The Wall Street Journal that British Air wants to start from scratch in any new bid for the nation 's second-largest airline , helped push UAL stock lower for the fourth straight day .
wsj_1792	7	UAL fell $ 6.25 a share to $ 191.75 on volume of 2.3 million shares in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange as concern deepened among takeover stock traders about the length of time it will take to revive the purchase .
wsj_1792	8	Under the original buy-out approved by the UAL board Sept. 14 , UAL 's pilots planned to put up $ 200 million in cash and make $ 200 million in annual cost concessions for a 75 % stake .
wsj_1792	9	UAL management was to pay $ 15 million for 10 % , and British Air was to receive a 15 % stake .
wsj_1792	10	The buy-out fell through when Citicorp and Chase Manhattan Corp. unexpectedly failed to obtain bank financing .
wsj_1792	11	Since then , UAL stock has fallen 33 % in what may rank as the largest collapse of a takeover stock ever .
wsj_1792	12	The tenor of Mr. Stevens 's remarks seemed to indicate that British Air will take a more active , high-profile role in pursuing any new bid .
wsj_1792	13	He said he believes UAL management was badly advised on the funding of its original transaction .
wsj_1792	14	Mr. Stevens said British Air has n't received any new buy-out proposals from the labor-management group , led by UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf , and has n't received any indication of when one might be forthcoming .
wsj_1792	15	`` As far as we 're concerned , we 're waiting for the dust to settle , '' he said .
wsj_1792	16	Although British Air is waiting to see what the buy-out group comes up with , Mr. Stevens said a revised transaction with less debt leverage is likely to be more attractive to banks .
wsj_1792	17	He said the original proposal is dead , and all aspects of a revised version are up for change , in light of the changes in UAL 's market price , the amount of debt banks are willing to fund , and the price British Air would be willing to pay .
wsj_1792	18	Mr. Stevens said he expects the new price will be considerably lower , but declined to specify a figure .
wsj_1792	19	Asked whether a $ 230-a-share figure circulating in the market yesterday is too low , he said , `` It 's certainly not too low . ''
wsj_1792	20	He added the original offer was `` a pretty full price , '' and that British Air 's contribution `` was quite a large chunk for us . ''
wsj_1792	21	British Air was originally attracted to the chance of obtaining a 15 % stake in the company , but was n't particularly happy with paying $ 750 million .
wsj_1792	22	`` If the new deal had us putting up less money but still having 15 % , that would be a point in our favor , '' he said .
wsj_1792	23	In any new proposal , British Air would expect a greater rate of return than the 20%-plus in the original proposal .
wsj_1792	24	In the event that the buy-out group stalls in reviving its bid , the UAL board could remain under some pressure to seek another transaction , even without any legal obligation to do so .
wsj_1792	25	Roughly one-third of its stock is believed held by takeover stock traders , who could vote to oust the board if they become impatient .
wsj_1792	26	Meanwhile , the buy-out group 's task of holding its fragile coalition together , in the face of the bid 's collapse and internal opposition from two other employee groups , has been further complicated by an apparent rift in the ranks of the pilot union itself .
wsj_1792	27	A pilot representing a group of 220 pilots hired during United 's 1985 strike filed suit Friday in Chicago federal court to block the takeover .
wsj_1792	28	The dissident pilots oppose the plan because it would cause them to lose their seniority .
wsj_1792	29	UAL 's management agreed to reduce the seniority of those pilots in exchange for the support of the United pilot union for the buy-out proposal .
wsj_1792	30	The 220 pilots involved in the suit are n't members of the union .
wsj_1792	31	The airline had allowed them to move ahead of some union members in seniority following the 1985 strike , a move the union had contested in a previous lawsuit .

wsj_1793	1	In the last decade , many corporations have embraced the `` utilization management '' cost containment strategy as a way to control health-care costs for employees .
wsj_1793	2	These programs vary widely , but often require second opinions on proposed surgery , preadmission reviews of elective hospitalizations and reviews of treatment during illnesses or recovery periods .
wsj_1793	3	Between 50 % and 75 % of today 's workers are covered by such plans , up from 5 % five years ago .
wsj_1793	4	`` Although it probably has reduced the level of expenditures for some purchasers , utilization management -- like most other cost containment strategies -- does n't appear to have altered the long-term rate of increase in health-care costs , '' the Institute of Medicine , an affiliate of the National Academy of Sciences , concluded after a two-year study .
wsj_1793	5	`` Employers who saw a short-term moderation in benefit expenditures are seeing a return to previous trends . ''
wsj_1793	6	While utilization management frequently reduces hospitalization costs , these savings are often offset by increases in outpatient services and higher administrative costs , according to the report by a panel of health-care experts .
wsj_1793	7	The report suggested that current review programs are too narrow .
wsj_1793	8	`` The unnecessary and inappropriate use of the hospital , and not the actual need for a particular procedure , has been the main focus , '' the panel said .
wsj_1793	9	`` As a general rule , prior-review programs have not made case-by-case assessments of the comparative costs of alternative treatments or sites of care . ''
wsj_1793	10	The report said that utilization management should have more of an impact as federal research on the effectiveness of medical treatments helps lead to medical practice guidelines .
wsj_1793	11	Howard Bailit , a panel member and a vice president of Aetna Life & Casualty , said that utilization management will also do a better job of containing costs as it spreads to cover medical services delivered outside of hospitals .
wsj_1793	12	`` There 's pretty good evidence that utilization management has reduced inappropriate hospitalization , '' he said .
wsj_1793	13	But at the same time , spending on physician services and ambulatory care have mushroomed .
wsj_1793	14	`` It 's like squeezing a balloon , '' Dr. Bailit said .
wsj_1793	15	David Rahill of A. Foster Higgins & Co. said that clients of his consulting firm report that utilization management reduces their hospital care bills by about 5 % , but he agreed that for the health-care system as whole , some of these savings are offset by administrative and outpatient care costs .
wsj_1793	16	Jerome Grossman , chairman of the panel , agrees that administrative costs of utilization management programs can be high .
wsj_1793	17	`` You have a whole staff standing ready '' to evaluate the appropriateness of recommended treatment , he said .
wsj_1793	18	Dr. Grossman , who also is president of New England Medical Center Hospitals in Boston , noted that the hospitals he runs deal with more than 100 utilization management firms and that many of them have different procedures and requirements .
wsj_1793	19	The panel urged greater efforts to reduce the complexity , paperwork and cost of utilization review .
wsj_1793	20	`` Utilization management needs to better demonstrate that it reduces the wasteful use of resources , improves the appropriateness of patient care and imposes only reasonable burdens on patients and providers , '' the panel concluded .
wsj_1794	0	Renault and DAF Trucks NV announced a preliminary agreement to jointly manufacture a line of trucks in Britain and France .
wsj_1794	1	Philippe Gras , a Renault managing director , said the new line will cover trucks of between 2.5 tons and 4.2 tons and will be built at Renault 's Bapilly plant in France and at DAF 's British plant .
wsj_1794	2	The French state-controlled auto group and the Dutch truck maker plan to incorporate the new trucks into their product lines when they begin production toward the middle of the 1990s .
wsj_1794	3	Mr. Gras said he expects a definitive agreement between the two companies to be completed in the next few months .
wsj_1794	4	The venture is the latest example of the trend toward cooperative projects in Europe ahead of the 1992 deadline for eliminating trade barriers within the European Community .
wsj_1794	5	Renault and DAF are expected to invest a total of about three billion French francs $ 157.8 million in the venture , including FFr 1 billion for design and development costs .
wsj_1794	6	In addition , the companies will each spend about FFr 1 billion on tooling up their plants .
wsj_1794	7	Mr. Gras said the joint venture represents considerable savings for both Renault and DAF , since both companies would in any case have had to renew their existing ranges of light goods vehicles .
wsj_1794	8	By pooling their resources , the two groups have effectively halved the design and development costs that would otherwise have been entailed , he said .
wsj_1794	9	Renault officials said the potential European market for light trucks in the 2.5-ton to 4.2-ton range is between 700,000 and 800,000 vehicles annually , and Renault and DAF are aiming for a combined market share of about 11 % .
wsj_1794	10	Both Renault and DAF will have world-wide marketing rights for the new range of vans and light trucks .
wsj_1794	11	Under a separate arrangement , British Aerospace PLC 's Rover Group PLC subsidiary will also be able to offer the vehicles through its dealers in the U.K. , and Renault 's truck-building subsidiary Renault Vehicles Industriels will have similar rights in France .
wsj_1794	12	DAF is 16%-owned by British Aerospace , with a further 6.5 % held by the Dutch state-owned chemical group NV DSM .
wsj_1794	13	The van Doorne family of the Netherlands holds an additional 11 % of DAF 's capital .
wsj_1795	0	The Federal Reserve System is the standard object of suggestions for organizational and institutional changes , for two reasons .
wsj_1795	1	First , its position in the government is anomalous .
wsj_1795	2	It has an unusual kind of independence from elected officials and still has authority over one of the most powerful of government 's instruments -- the control of the money supply .
wsj_1795	3	Thus we have a condition that is easily described as undemocratic .
wsj_1795	4	Second , the responsibilities of the Federal Reserve as guardian of the currency , which means as guardian of the stability of the price level , sometimes lead it to take measures that are unpopular .
wsj_1795	5	As former Fed Chairman William McChesney Martin used to say , they would have to take the punch bowl away just as the party is getting interesting .
wsj_1795	6	So the Federal Reserve is an attractive target for complaint by politicians .
wsj_1795	7	The Fed is easily assigned the blame for unpleasantness , like high interest rates or slow economic growth , while the politicians can escape responsibility by pointing to the Fed 's independence .
wsj_1795	8	This leads to proposals for `` reform '' of the Fed , which have the common feature of making the Fed more responsive to the administration , to the Congress and to public opinion -- without , however , any assumption of additional responsibility by the politicians .
wsj_1795	9	These proposals include changing the term of the chairman , shortening the terms of the members , eliminating the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks from the decision-making process , putting the Secretary of the Treasury on the Federal Reserve Board , having the Fed audited by an arm of Congress the General Accounting Office , putting the Fed 's expenditures in the budget , and requiring prompt publication of the Fed 's minutes .
wsj_1795	10	Some of these ideas are again under consideration in Congress .
wsj_1795	11	But these proposals do not rest on a view of what the Fed 's problem is or , if they do , they rest on an incorrect view .
wsj_1795	12	They would not solve the problem ; they would make it worse .
wsj_1795	13	The problem is not that the Fed is too unresponsive to the public interest .
wsj_1795	14	On the contrary , it is too responsive to an incorrect view of the public interest .
wsj_1795	15	The price level in the U.S. is now about 4 1/4 times as high as it was 30 years ago .
wsj_1795	16	On average , something that cost $ 100 30 years ago now costs $ 425 .
wsj_1795	17	Or , a wage that was $ 100 30 years ago would buy only $ 23.53 worth of stuff today .
wsj_1795	18	On two occasions the inflation rate rose to more than 10 % a year .
wsj_1795	19	In each case the ending of this unsustainable inflation caused a severe recession -- the two worst of the postwar period .
wsj_1795	20	The enormous inflation over the past 30 years was largely due to monetary policy .
wsj_1795	21	At least , it would not have happened without the support of monetary policy that provided for a 10-fold increase in the money supply during the same period .
wsj_1795	22	And that increase in the money supply would not have happened without the consent of the Federal Reserve .
wsj_1795	23	The basic problem of monetary policy , to which reform of the Fed should be addressed , is to prevent a recurrence of this experience .
wsj_1795	24	There were two general reasons for the mistaken monetary policy of the past 30 years :
wsj_1795	25	1 . To some extent the Federal Reserve shared the popular but incorrect view that expansionary monetary policy could yield a net improvement in employment and output .
wsj_1795	26	2 . Even where the Fed did not share this view it felt the need to accommodate to it .
wsj_1795	27	Despite all the formal provisions for its independence , the Fed seems constantly to feel that if it uses its independence too freely it will lose it .
wsj_1795	28	The common proposals for reforming the Fed would only make the situation worse , if they had any effect at all .
wsj_1795	29	Putting the Secretary of the Treasury on the Board of Governors , one of the leading proposals today , is an example .
wsj_1795	30	The secretary is the world 's biggest borrower of money .
wsj_1795	31	He has a built-in , constant longing for lower interest rates .
wsj_1795	32	Moreover , he is a political agent of a political president , who naturally gives extraordinary weight to the way the economy will perform before the next election , and less to its longer-run health .
wsj_1795	33	These days , the secretary suffers the further disqualification that he is a member of a club of seven finance ministers who meet occasionally to decide what exchange rates should be , which is a diversion from the real business of the Federal Reserve to stabilize the price level .
wsj_1795	34	How should a reasonable member of the Federal Reserve Board interpret a congressional decision to put the secretary on the board ?
wsj_1795	35	Could he plausibly interpret it as encouragement for the Fed to give primary emphasis to stabilizing the price level ?
wsj_1795	36	Or would he interpret it as instruction to give more weight to these other objectives that the secretary represents -- low interest rates , short-run economic expansion , and stabilization of exchange rates at internationally managed levels ?
wsj_1795	37	The answer seems perfectly clear .
wsj_1795	38	True , a succession of Fed chairmen has given color to the notion that the Secretary of the Treasury belongs on the Fed .
wsj_1795	39	By their constant readiness to advise all and sundry about federal budgetary matters the chairmen have encouraged the belief that fiscal policy and monetary policy are ingredients of a common stew , in which case it is natural that the Fed and the Treasury , and probably also the Congress , should be jointly engaged in stirring the pot .
wsj_1795	40	The Fed 's case for its own independence would be a little stronger if it were more solicitous of the independence of the rest of the government . )
wsj_1795	41	The Fed 's problem is not that it is too independent , or too unpolitical .
wsj_1795	42	The Fed is responsive to , and can not help being responsive to , the more overtly political part of the government .
wsj_1795	43	The Fed exercises a power given to it by Congress and the president .
wsj_1795	44	But Congress and the president accept no responsibility for the exercise of the power they have given the Fed .
wsj_1795	45	Critics of the present arrangement are correct to say that it is undemocratic .
wsj_1795	46	What is undemocratic is the unwillingness of the more political parts of the government to take the responsibility for deciding the basic question of monetary policy , which is what priority should be given to stabilizing the price level .
wsj_1795	47	To leave this decision to an `` independent '' agency is not only undemocratic .
wsj_1795	48	It also prevents the conduct of a policy that has a long-term rationale , because it leaves the Fed guessing about what are the expectations of its masters , the politicians , who have never had to consider the long-term consequences of monetary policy .
wsj_1795	49	The greatest contribution Congress could make at this time would be to declare that stabilizing the price level is the primary responsibility of the Federal Reserve System .
wsj_1795	50	Legislation to this effect has been introduced in Congress in this session by Rep. Stephen Neal D. , N.C . .
wsj_1795	51	It is not the kind of thing that is likely to be enacted , however .
wsj_1795	52	Congress would be required to make a hard decision , and Congress would much prefer to leave the hard decision to the Fed and retain its rights of complaint after the fact .
wsj_1795	53	People will say that the nation and the government have other objectives , in addition to stabilizing the price level , which is true .
wsj_1795	54	But that is not the same as saying that the Federal Reserve has other objectives .
wsj_1795	55	The government has other agencies and instruments for pursuing these other objectives .
wsj_1795	56	But it has only the Fed to pursue price-level stability .
wsj_1795	57	And the Fed has at most very limited ability to contribute to the achievement of other objectives by means other than by stabilizing the price level .
wsj_1795	58	The two objectives most commonly thought to be legitimate competitors for the attention of the Fed are high employment and rapid real growth .
wsj_1795	59	But the main lesson of economic policy in the past 30 years is that if the Fed compromises with the price-stability objective in the pursuit of these other goals , the result is not high employment and rapid growth but is inflation .

wsj_1796	0	Republic New York Corp. joined the list of banks boosting reserves for losses on loans to less-developed countries , setting out a $ 200 million provision and posting a $ 155.4 million third-quarter net loss as a result .
wsj_1796	1	The per-share loss was $ 5.32 .
wsj_1796	2	In the year earlier period , the New York parent of Republic National Bank had net income of $ 38.7 million , or $ 1.12 a share .
wsj_1796	3	Excluding the provision , Republic earned $ 44.6 million , up 15 % from a year ago .
wsj_1796	4	The bank 's medium-term and long-term loans to less-developed countries total $ 293 million , of which $ 146 million are n't accruing interest , the bank said .
wsj_1796	5	Republic 's total of nonperforming assets was $ 167 million at Sept. 30 , with its reserve for loan losses now standing at $ 357 million .
wsj_1797	0	Abortion-rights advocates won last week 's battles , but the war over the nation 's most-contentious social question is about to pick up again on turf that favors those seeking to restrict abortions .
wsj_1797	1	Strict new regulations seem certain to pass the state House in Pennsylvania next week , with easy approval by the Senate and by Democratic Gov. Bob Casey expected shortly thereafter .
wsj_1797	2	Legislation to require the consent of parents before their daughters under the age of 18 can have abortions will probably pass both houses of the Michigan legislature and set up a grinding battle to override the expected veto of Democratic Gov. James Blanchard .
wsj_1797	3	The short-term shift in the political climate surrounding abortion reflects two factors that are likely to govern the debate in the next several months : the reawakening of the abortion-rights movement as a potent force after years of lassitude , and the ability of each side to counter the other 's advance in one arena with a victory of its own elsewhere .
wsj_1797	4	The action in Pennsylvania , for example , will follow last week 's collapse of a special session of the Florida legislature to enact restrictions on abortions in that state , and the vote here in Washington by the House to permit federally paid abortions for poor women who are victims of rape or incest .
wsj_1797	5	But President Bush is expected to veto the congressional legislation and that , along with the easy approval of the Pennsylvania measure , is likely to mute the abortion-rights activists ' claims of momentum and underline the challenges faced by this resurgent movement .
wsj_1797	6	`` It 's great to feel good for once in 15 years , '' says Harrison Hickman , a consultant to abortion-rights advocates , reflecting the relief of his compatriots after last week 's victories , the first major events since the Supreme Court , in its July 3 Webster decision , permitted the states to enact restrictions on abortions .
wsj_1797	7	`` But how many more times we 're going to feel good in the next 15 is another question . ''
wsj_1797	8	Indeed , abortion-rights activists still face their greatest tests .
wsj_1797	9	`` The pro-choice movement has shown -- finally -- that it can mobilize , '' says Glen Halva-Neubauer , a Furman University political scientist who specializes in how state legislators handle the abortion question .
wsj_1797	10	`` But it still has n't shown that it can win in a state like Pennsylvania or Missouri , where abortion has been clearly an electoral issue and where it 's been an emotional issue for a long time . ''
wsj_1797	11	The foes of abortion hold the strong whip hand in Pennsylvania , where abortion-rights activists are so much on the defensive that their strategy is less to fight the proposed legislation than it is to stress how the state legislature does n't reflect the viewpoints of the state 's citizens .
wsj_1797	12	As a result , GOP state Rep. Stephen Freind of Delaware County , the legislature 's leading foe of abortion , has been given all but free rein to press a strict seven-point plan to restrict abortion and , he hopes , to force the Supreme Court directly to reassess its 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that established the right of abortion in the first place .
wsj_1797	13	The Freind legislation -- the state 's House Judiciary Committee approved it in Harrisburg this week and the full Pennsylvania House is expected to take up the bill next Tuesday -- includes a provision to ban abortions after 24 weeks of pregnancy , except to avert the death of the mother .
wsj_1797	14	Mr. Freind calculates that the provision , which attacks the trimester standards that Roe established , will `` make it necessary '' for the Supreme Court to review Roe and , perhaps , to overturn it .
wsj_1797	15	But the Pennsylvania measure also includes an `` informed consent '' provision that may become widely imitated by abortion foes who want to make women contemplating abortion as uncomfortable as possible with the procedure and with themselves .
wsj_1797	16	Under this legislation , a woman must be informed 24 hours before the operation of the details of the procedure and its risks .
wsj_1797	17	`` Regardless of whether one supports or opposes the right to an abortion , '' Mr. Freind argues , `` it is virtually impossible for any rational human being to disagree with the concept that a woman has the right to have all of the appropriate materials and advice made available to her before she makes a decision which , one way or the other , might remain with her for the rest of her life . ''
wsj_1797	18	In Michigan , where the state Senate is expected to approve parental-consent legislation by the end of next week , Gov. Blanchard is the principal obstacle for anti-abortionists .
wsj_1797	19	Susan Rogin , a consultant to abortion-rights activists in the state , takes comfort from the fact that the state 's House abortion opponents `` have n't been able to muster the votes to overturn a veto on abortion in 16 years . ''
wsj_1797	20	But proponents believe they may be able to shake enough votes loose to override the veto if they are successful in portraying the legislation as a matter of parents ' rights .
wsj_1797	21	In Illinois , lawmakers will vote before next spring on legislation requiring physicians to perform tests on fetuses at 20 weeks to determine their gestational age , weight and lung maturity along with a provision requiring that , if fetuses survive an abortion , a second doctor must be on hand to help it survive .
wsj_1797	22	The legislation failed by one vote to clear the House Rules Committee Tuesday , but anti-abortionists still may succeed in bringing the measure to the floor this fall .
wsj_1797	23	Pamela Sutherland , executive director of the Illinois Planned Parenthood Council , says she and her allies are `` cautiously optimistic '' they can defeat it if it comes to a floor vote .
wsj_1797	24	Abortion foes in Wisconsin , meanwhile , expect a parental-consent bill to be sent to the state assembly floor by early November and are hopeful of prevailing in both houses by next March .
wsj_1797	25	In Texas , abortion opponents want to pass parental-consent legislation along with a statewide ban on the use of public funds , personnel and facilities for abortion , and viability tests for fetuses 19 weeks and older .
wsj_1797	26	The anti-abortionists are urging GOP Gov. Bill Clements to press the issues in a special session scheduled to run Nov. 14 to Dec. 13 .
wsj_1797	27	`` The prognosis is only fair , '' says Kathie Roberts , administrative director of the Texas Right to Life Committee .
wsj_1797	28	`` Next year is an election year and the legislators just do n't want to do anything about this now . ''
wsj_1797	29	This legislative activity comes as both sides are undertaking new mobilization efforts , plunging into gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey , and girding for next autumn 's state elections .
wsj_1797	30	At the same time , abortion foes have developed a national legislative strategy , deciding to move on what Jacki Ragan , the National Right to Life Committee 's director of state organizational development , calls `` reasonable measures that an overwhelming mainstream majority of Americans support . ''
wsj_1797	31	These include bans on the use of abortion for birth control and sex selection , and the public funding of alternatives for abortion .
wsj_1797	32	`` Those who are on the other side can hardly oppose alternative funding if they continue to insist on calling themselves ` pro-choice ' rather than ` pro-abortion , ' '' says Mary Spaulding , the group 's associate state legislative coordinator .
wsj_1797	33	Over the weekend , the National Abortion Rights Action League singled out eight politicians , including Pennsylvania 's Mr. Freind , as 1990 targets and held a Washington seminar designed to train its leaders in political techniques , including how to put the anti-abortionists on the defensive in state legislatures .
wsj_1797	34	`` We now see pro-choice legislators going on the offensive for the first time , '' says Kate Michelman , executive director of the group .

wsj_1800	1	Final approval came on a simple voice vote in the Senate , and the swift passage contrasted with months of negotiations over the underlying bill which is laced with special-interest provisions for both members and the executive branch .
wsj_1800	2	An estimated $ 33 million was added for university and science grants , including $ 1.5 million for Smith College .

wsj_1800	6	Within the IRS , nearly $ 1.95 billion is provided for processing tax returns , a 12 % increase over fiscal 1989 and double what the government was spending five years ago .
wsj_1800	7	Investigation and taxpayer service accounts would grow to $ 1.6 billion , and Congress specifically added $ 7.4 million for stepped up criminal investigations of money laundering related to drug traffic .

wsj_1800	17	A House-Senate conference reached agreement Oct. 5 on virtually all major provisions of the bill , but final settlement has been stalled because of differences between the two men over the fate of a modest Arkansas-based program to provide technical information to farmers seeking to reduce their dependence on chemical fertilizers and pesticides .

wsj_1804	0	Whitbread & Co. put its spirits division up for sale , triggering a scramble among global groups for the British company 's brands .
wsj_1804	1	Whitbread already has been approached by `` about half a dozen '' companies interested in buying all or part of the spirits business , a spokesman said .
wsj_1804	2	Analysts expect the spirits operations and some California vineyards that also are being sold to fetch about # 500 million $ 788.8 million .
wsj_1804	3	Among the brands for sale are Beefeater gin , the No. 2 imported gin in the U.S. , and Laphroaig single-malt whiskey .
wsj_1804	4	Also for sale are Buckingham Wile Co. , which distributes Cutty Sark blended whiskey in the U.S. , and Whitbread 's Atlas Peak Vineyards in California 's Napa Valley .
wsj_1804	5	Beefeater alone is worth as much as # 300 million , analysts said .
wsj_1804	6	Whitbread bought the Beefeater distillery two years ago for # 174.5 million .
wsj_1804	7	That purchase represented an attempt by Whitbread , a venerable British brewer , to become a major player in the global liquor business .
wsj_1804	8	But Whitbread has been squeezed by giant rivals amid widespread consolidation in the industry .
wsj_1804	9	Now , it wants to concentrate on beer and its newer hotel and restaurant operations .
wsj_1804	10	For rival liquor companies , the Whitbread auction is a rare opportunity to acquire valuable brands .
wsj_1804	11	`` It 's not very often something like this comes up , '' said Ron Littleboy , a liquor company analyst at Nomura Research Institute in London .

wsj_1804	15	The Whitbread spirits auction `` is an extremely interesting development ... and naturally we 'll be considering it carefully , '' a Grand Met spokesman said .
wsj_1804	16	Guinness , which owns several leading whiskey brands plus Gordon 's gin , the world 's No. 1 gin , is considered less likely to bid for the Whitbread spirits .
wsj_1804	17	A Guinness spokesman declined to comment .
wsj_1804	18	Two other global liquor giants , Canada 's Seagram Co. and Britain 's Allied-Lyons PLC , also are possible buyers .
wsj_1804	19	Seagram 's gin is the world 's No. 2 gin brand , but the company does n't own any of the major gin brands imported in the U.S. .
wsj_1804	20	Allied-Lyons , while powerful in whiskey , does n't own any major white-spirit brands .
wsj_1804	21	`` We will certainly have to take a look at '' the Whitbread spirits business , an Allied-Lyons spokesman said .
wsj_1804	22	`` We would certainly like to have a major white-spirits brand in our portfolio . ''
wsj_1804	23	A Seagram spokesman in New York would n't comment .
wsj_1804	24	Smaller liquor companies , such as Brown-Forman Corp. and American Brands Inc. of the U.S. , also are likely to be interested .
wsj_1804	25	Such companies `` are increasingly being left behind '' in the global liquor business , says Nomura 's Mr. Littleboy .
wsj_1804	26	In New York , a spokesman for American Brands would n't comment .
wsj_1804	27	Brown-Forman , a Louisville , Ky. distiller , also declined to comment .
wsj_1804	28	Whitbread 's wine , spirits and soft-drink operations had trading profit of # 35.4 million on sales of # 315.5 million in the year ended Feb. 25 .
wsj_1804	29	The company , which is retaining most of its wine and all of its soft-drink interests , did n't break out results for the businesses it plans to sell .
wsj_1804	30	But analysts estimate their trading profit at # 30 million .
wsj_1804	31	Whitbread had total pretax profit in the year ended Feb. 25 of # 223.2 million , on sales of # 2.26 billion .
wsj_1804	32	Whitbread 's spirits auction occurs amid a parallel shakeup in the British beer industry .
wsj_1804	33	Earlier this year , the government announced plans to foster increased competition in the industry .
wsj_1804	34	British brewers currently own thousands of pubs , which in turn sell only the breweries ' beer and soft drinks .
wsj_1804	35	Under new rules , many of the country 's pubs would become `` free houses , '' selling beers of their choice .
wsj_1804	36	Whitbread now intends to bolster its brewing interests , in an effort to grab a share of sales to free houses .
wsj_1804	37	The company , which last month paid # 50.7 million for regional British brewer Boddington Group PLC , has about 13 % of the British beer market .
wsj_1804	38	Whitbread also owns the license to brew and distribute Heineken and Stella Artois beers in Britain .
wsj_1804	39	In addition , Whitbread intends to focus on its newer hotel , liquor store and restaurant businesses in Europe and North America .
wsj_1804	40	In Britain , those interests include the Beefeater steakhouse chain and joint ownership with PepsiCo Inc. of the country 's Pizza Hut chain .
wsj_1804	41	In Canada and the U.S. , Whitbread owns The Keg chain of steak and seafood restaurants .
wsj_1804	42	Focusing on beer , restaurants and hotels means `` we can concentrate our skills and resources more effectively , '' Peter Jarvis , Whitbread 's managing director , said in a statement .
wsj_1804	43	The spirits business `` would require substantial additional investment to enable it to compete effectively in the first division of global players . ''
wsj_1804	44	Whitbread also announced that Mr. Jarvis , who is 48 , will become the company 's chief executive March 1 .
wsj_1804	45	At that time Sam Whitbread , the company 's chairman and a descendant of its 18th-century founder , will retire from executive duties .
wsj_1804	46	He will retain the honorary title of non-executive chairman .
wsj_1805	0	The Treasury plans to raise $ 700 million in new cash with the sale Tuesday of about $ 10 billion in two-year notes to redeem $ 9.29 billion in maturing notes .
wsj_1805	1	The offering will be dated Oct. 31 and mature Oct. 31 ,
wsj_1805	2	Tenders for the notes , available in minimum $ 5,000 denominations , must be received by 1 p.m. EDT Tuesday at the Treasury or at Federal Reserve banks or branches .
wsj_1806	0	NEWHALL LAND & FARMING Co. , Valencia , Calif. , announced a 2-for-1 split in the real estate limited partnership 's units and increased its regular quarterly cash distribution 33 % , to 40 cents a unit .
wsj_1806	1	The real estate limited partnership also said it will pay a special year-end cash distribution of 10 cents a unit .
wsj_1806	2	Both distributions are payable Dec. 4 to limited partners of record Nov. 3 .
wsj_1807	0	Mellon Bank Corp. said directors authorized the buy-back of as many as 250,000 common shares .
wsj_1807	1	The bank holding company said stock repurchased will be used to meet requirements for the company 's benefit plans .
wsj_1807	2	Mellon has 36.6 million shares outstanding .
wsj_1808	0	Champion International Corp. 's third-quarter profit dropped 17 % , reflecting price declines for certain paper products , operating problems at certain mills , and other factors .
wsj_1808	1	The paper producer reported that net income fell to $ 102.1 million , or $ 1.09 a share , from $ 122.4 million , or $ 1.29 a share , in the year-earlier period .
wsj_1808	2	Sales rose 2.6 % to $ 1.32 billion from $ 1.29 billion .
wsj_1808	3	In New York Stock Exchange composite trading , Champion 's shares rose 25 cents to $ 32.125 .
wsj_1810	0	The frenetic stock and bond markets cooled off , but the dollar slumped .
wsj_1810	1	Stocks rose slightly as trading activity slowed from the frenzied pace earlier this week .
wsj_1810	2	Prices of long-term Treasury bonds hovered in a narrow band most of the day , finishing little changed despite the dollar 's weakness and fears about a wave of government borrowing coming soon .
wsj_1810	3	Helped by futures-related program buying , the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 4.92 points to close at 2643.65 .
wsj_1810	4	But the Dow Jones Transportation Average fell for the seventh-consecutive session as more investors dumped UAL shares .
wsj_1810	5	Bond prices rallied early yesterday morning as traders scrambled to buy Treasury issues on fears that the Northern California earthquake might lead to a stock-market debacle .
wsj_1810	6	But when stocks held steady , Treasury bonds later retreated .
wsj_1810	7	Speculation that the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates in coming weeks helped push the dollar down while boosting stocks , traders said .
wsj_1810	8	But many investors remain wary about stocks , partly because they expect continued turbulence in the junk-bond market that would make it more difficult to finance corporate takeovers .
wsj_1810	9	`` I 'm surprised we did n't see more volatility '' in stocks , said Raymond F. DeVoe Jr. , market strategist at Legg Mason Wood Walker .
wsj_1810	10	`` I think the problems in the junk-bond area are just beginning , and this will be very unsettling for companies that have issued junk bonds .
wsj_1810	11	In a bull market , credit does not matter , '' Mr. DeVoe added .
wsj_1810	12	`` But when it does matter , then it 's the only thing that matters . ''
wsj_1810	13	However , many institutional investors are reacting to the stock market 's plunge as `` a great buying opportunity , '' said Charles I. Clough , chief investment strategist at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets .
wsj_1810	14	`` Things are beginning to settle down .
wsj_1810	15	The markets are returning to normalcy . ''
wsj_1810	16	Oil prices initially rose on fears that the massive earthquake in Northern California would disrupt production .
wsj_1810	17	But prices later reversed course , finishing slightly lower , as investors concluded that any cuts would n't be large and that foreign oil producers would quickly pick up the slack .
wsj_1810	18	In major market activity :
wsj_1810	19	New York Stock Exchange volume shrank to 166.9 million shares from 224.1 million Tuesday .
wsj_1810	20	Advancers on the Big Board outpaced decliners by 822 to 668 .
wsj_1810	21	Bond prices were little changed in sluggish activity .
wsj_1810	22	The yield on the Treasury 's 30-year issue fell slightly to 8.03 % .
wsj_1810	23	In New York late yesterday , the currency was at 141.45 yen and 1.8485 marks , down from 142.75 yen and 1.8667 marks late Tuesday .
wsj_1811	0	James L. Madson , 46 years old , was named a vice president and assistant general manager of this producer of copper and other minerals .
wsj_1811	1	He will succeed Arthur E. Himebaugh as general manager Feb. 1 , when Mr. Himebaugh retires .
wsj_1812	0	AMR Corp. posted an 8.8 % drop in third-quarter net income and said the fourth quarter will be `` disappointing '' as well , primarily because of slimmer profit margins and increased fuel costs .
wsj_1812	1	AMR 's earnings decline comes a year after the parent company of American Airlines and the rest of the airline industry set profit records .
wsj_1812	2	Some analysts say the latest results only seem pale by comparison with a spectacular second half of 1988 .
wsj_1812	3	Still , AMR 's stumble does n't bode well for the rest of the industry .
wsj_1812	4	The Fort Worth , Texas , company is generally regarded as one of the best-run in the business , and its difficulties are likely to be reflected industrywide as other major carriers report third-quarter results over the next several days .
wsj_1812	5	Meanwhile , the company 's board , which had said nothing publicly about investor Donald Trump 's recently withdrawn $ 7.5 billion offer for AMR , issued a statement condemning `` ill-conceived and reckless '' bids and saying it was `` pleased '' that Mr. Trump had backed out .
wsj_1812	6	In the third quarter , AMR said , net fell to $ 137 million , or $ 2.16 a share , from $ 150.3 million , or $ 2.50 a share .
wsj_1812	7	Revenue rose 17 % to $ 2.73 billion from $ 2.33 billion a year earlier .
wsj_1812	8	AMR 's chairman , Robert L. Crandall , said the results were due to an 11 % year-to-year increase in fuel prices and a slight decrease in yield , an industry measure analogous to profit margin on each seat sold .
wsj_1812	9	`` We think these trends will continue and will produce a very disappointing fourth quarter as well , '' he said .
wsj_1812	10	Tim Pettee , an analyst with Merrill Lynch & Co. , said : `` The business turned faster than expected .
wsj_1812	11	Costs are giving them a little bit of trouble , and the whole industry is having a pricing problem . ''
wsj_1812	12	For the nine months , AMR 's net rose 15 % to $ 415.9 million , or $ 6.59 a share , from $ 360.1 million , or $ 5.99 a share .
wsj_1812	13	Revenue jumped 22 % to $ 7.89 billion from $ 6.46 billion .
wsj_1812	14	AMR 's board , in a statement after a regular meeting yesterday , said : `` Ill-considered and reckless acquisition proposals adversely affect employee , financial and business relationships and are contrary to the best interests of AMR shareholders ... .
wsj_1812	15	AMR has not been , and is not , for sale . ''
wsj_1812	16	Mr. Crandall said the company 's current decline in earnings is exactly the kind of situation that an excessively leveraged company laden with debt from a takeover would find difficult to weather .
wsj_1812	17	`` Our very disappointing third-quarter results and the discouraging outlook for the fourth quarter underscore the importance of an adequate capital base , '' he said .
wsj_1813	0	Christopher Whittington , 51-year-old deputy chairman of this British investment-banking group and chairman of Morgan Grenfell & Co. , the group 's main banking unit , has retired from his executive duties .
wsj_1813	1	Succeeding Mr. Whittington as deputy chairman of the group is Anthony Richmond-Watson , 43 , currently a main board member .
wsj_1813	2	Succeeding Mr. Whittington at Morgan Grenfell & Co. is Richard Webb , 50 , currently deputy chairman .
wsj_1813	3	Mr. Whittington will remain on the main group board as a nonexecutive director .
wsj_1814	0	Without federal subsidies to developers of beach houses , the economic and structural damage by Hurricane Hugo in South Carolina would have been much less , as highlighted by your Oct. 3 editorial `` Subsidizing Disaster . ''
wsj_1814	1	Congress should stop throwing tax dollars out to sea by subsidizing the development of beach communities on ecologically fragile coastal barrier islands , such as the hard-hit Isle of Palms near Charleston .
wsj_1814	2	As you mentioned , subsidies for development on a number of barrier islands were curtailed in 1982 by the Coastal Barrier Resource System .
wsj_1814	3	The National Taxpayers Union would like Congress to add 800,000 acres to the 453,000 of shoreline in the system by enacting `` The Coastal Barrier Improvement Act of 1989 . ''
wsj_1814	4	This bill simply says that if you want to develop property on a barrier island you have to do so without taxpayer support .
wsj_1814	5	Private-property rights would be upheld because the legislation would not ban coastal development .
wsj_1814	6	However , home builders would have to bear the full costs of such beach-house construction .
wsj_1814	7	A Taxpayers Union study concluded the bill would save taxpayers up to $ 9.3 billion in barrier-island subsidies over 20 years .
wsj_1814	8	Already , the 1982 legislation has saved an estimated $ 800 million .
wsj_1815	0	The government said 13.1 % of Americans , or 31.9 million people , were living in poverty in 1988 .
wsj_1815	1	While last year 's figure was down from 13.4 % in 1987 and marked the fifth consecutive annual decline in the poverty rate , the Census Bureau said the 1988 drop was n't statistically significant .
wsj_1815	2	The bureau 's report also showed that while some measures of the nation 's economic well-being improved modestly in 1988 , the fruits of prosperity were shared less equitably than the year before .
wsj_1815	3	Summarizing data derived from a March 1989 survey of 58,000 households , William Butz , associate director of the Census Bureau , said that `` most groups either stayed the same or improved . ''
wsj_1815	4	But , he added , `` Since the late 1960s , the distribution of income has been slowly getting less equal .
wsj_1815	5	There was no reversal of that trend between 1987 and 1988 . ''
wsj_1815	6	Per capita income , a widely used measure of a nation 's economic health , hit a record in 1988 , rising 1.7 % after inflation adjustment to $ 13,120 .
wsj_1815	7	But the median income of American families fell 0.2 % , the first time it has failed to rise since 1982 .
wsj_1815	8	Mr. Butz said the divergence in the two measures reflects changes in family size and structure , including the rising number of female-headed families and a sharp increase in income reported by Americans who are n't living in families .
wsj_1815	9	As a result of last year 's decline , the government 's estimate for the number of people living below the poverty line declined by about 500,000 .
wsj_1815	10	The poverty threshold , defined as three times food expenses as calculated by the Agricultural Department , last year was $ 12,092 for a family of four .
wsj_1815	11	The Census Bureau counts all cash income in determining whether families are below the line , but it does n't consider other government benefits , such as Medicare .
wsj_1815	12	Thanks largely to the continued growth of the U.S. economy , the poverty rate is now substantially lower than the 1983 peak of 15.3 % , but the improvements have been modest in the past couple of years .
wsj_1815	13	Poverty remains far more widespread among blacks than other Americans .
wsj_1815	14	In 1988 , 31.6 % of blacks lived in poverty , compared with 10.1 % for whites and 26.8 % for Hispanics .
wsj_1815	15	But two-thirds of all poor Americans were white .
wsj_1815	16	More than half of poor families were headed by women living without men , the bureau said .
wsj_1815	17	More than three-fourths of poor black families were headed by women .
wsj_1815	18	The poverty rate of children under 18 years old dropped last year to 19.7 % from 20.5 % in 1987 , but remained far higher than a decade ago .
wsj_1815	19	The rate among the elderly -- 12 % in 1988 -- was n't significantly lower than the year before .
wsj_1815	20	If it were n't for Social Security payments , more than three times as many elderly would be below the poverty line , Mr. Butz said .
wsj_1815	21	The Census Bureau also said :
wsj_1815	22	-- Some 17.2 % of all money income received by families in 1988 went to the wealthiest 5 % of all families , up from 16.9 % in 1987 .
wsj_1815	23	That is the greatest share reported for any year since 1950 , although changing definitions over the years distort the comparison .
wsj_1815	24	-- The top fifth of all families got 44 % of the income , up from 41.5 % a decade earlier .
wsj_1815	25	The bottom fifth of all families got 4.6 % of the income , down from 5.2 % a decade earlier .
wsj_1815	26	-- Confirming other government data showing that wages are n't keeping pace with inflation , earnings of year-round , full-time male workers fell 1.3 % in 1988 after adjusting for higher prices , the first such drop since 1982 .
wsj_1815	27	Earnings of female workers were unchanged .
wsj_1815	28	-- Women working full-time earned 66 cents for every dollar earned by men , a penny more than in 1987 and seven cents more than in 1978 .
wsj_1815	29	-- Median household income -- which includes both those living in families and those who are n't -- rose 0.3 % last year to $ 27,225 after inflation .
wsj_1815	30	It rose sharply in the Northeast and Midwest and fell slightly in the South and West .
wsj_1815	31	Median family income was $ 32,191 , down 0.2 % .
wsj_1815	32	-- Per capita income of blacks , though still only 60 % that of whites , rose 3.9 % in 1988 , while per capita income of whites rose only 1.5 % .
wsj_1815	33	-- Among married couples , the gap between blacks and whites narrowed sharply , as income of black families shot up 6.8 % while income of whites did n't budge .
wsj_1815	34	Fueling a controversy that has been simmering for years , the Census Bureau also said its figures would look far rosier if it recalculated the poverty threshold using an improved consumer-price measure adopted in 1983 .
wsj_1815	35	The bureau said some 3.5 million fewer people would have fallen below the poverty line in 1988 -- and the poverty rate would have been 10.5 % instead of 13.1 % -- under the alternative calculation .
wsj_1815	36	Critics on the left and right have been calling for all sorts of revisions to the measure for years .
wsj_1815	37	A report by the staff of the Joint Economic Committee of Congress released yesterday concluded , `` It is misleading to make this change without adjusting for other changes . ''
wsj_1815	38	The official poverty threshold is set by the Office of Management and Budget .
wsj_1816	0	John E. Hayes Jr. was elected chairman , president and chief executive officer , succeeding David S. Black , who retired .
wsj_1816	1	Mr. Hayes , 52 years old , left Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. in January , where he had been chairman , president and chief executive , to join Triad Capital Partners , a St. Louis company with interests in solid waste and recycling , telecommunications and international venture capital .
wsj_1816	2	He has resigned his posts at Triad to take the Kansas Power positions .
wsj_1816	3	Kansas Power said Mr. Black , 61 , chose early retirement .
wsj_1818	0	The Associated Press 's earthquake coverage drew attention to a phenomenon that deserves some thought by public officials and other policy makers .
wsj_1818	1	Private relief agencies , such as the Salvation Army and Red Cross , mobilized almost instantly to help people , while the Washington bureaucracy `` took hours getting into gear . ''
wsj_1818	2	One news show we saw yesterday even displayed 25 federal officials meeting around a table .
wsj_1818	3	We recall that the mayor of Charleston complained bitterly about the federal bureaucracy 's response to Hurricane Hugo .
wsj_1818	4	The sense grows that modern public bureaucracies simply do n't perform their assigned functions well .
wsj_1820	0	After failing to find a buyer for the Sears Tower in Chicago , Sears , Roebuck & Co. is negotiating with Boston pension fund adviser Aldrich , Eastman & Waltch Inc. to refinance the property for close to $ 850 million , according to people close to the negotiations .
wsj_1820	1	Under the proposed agreement involving the world 's tallest building , Chicago-based Sears would receive about half the money through conventional mortgage financing and the other half as a convertible mortgage .
wsj_1820	2	At the end of the term of the convertible loan , Sears could still own half the building , and AEW could own the other half .
wsj_1820	3	Neither side would comment .
wsj_1820	4	The parties are currently negotiating over who would manage the building , which will be emptied of 6,000 employees from Sears ' merchandise group , which is moving elsewhere .
wsj_1820	5	The new manager will face the daunting task of leasing 1.8 million square feet in a relatively soft Chicago real estate market .
wsj_1820	6	Also , it has not yet been decided exactly how much of the mortgage AEW will be able to convert into equity .
wsj_1820	7	Convertible mortgages have become an increasingly popular way to finance prestigious buildings of late .
wsj_1820	8	In a convertible mortgage , the investor lends the building owner a certain amount in return for the option to convert its interest into equity , usually less than 50 % , at the end of the loan term .
wsj_1820	9	During the term , the lender can either receive a percentage of cash flow , a percentage of the building 's appreciation or a fixed return .
wsj_1820	10	The main advantage of a convertible mortgage is that it is not a sale and therefore does not trigger costly transfer taxes and reappraisal .
wsj_1820	11	Sears said it would put the 110-story tower on the block almost a year ago as part of its anti-takeover restructuring .
wsj_1820	12	But Japanese institutions shied away from bidding on the high-profile tower out of fear their purchase of the property would trigger anti-Japanese sentiment .
wsj_1820	13	Last summer , Sears appeared to have a deal with Canadian developer Olympia & York Developments Ltd .
wsj_1820	14	But that deal fell through in September after it became clear that the sale would lead to a major real estate tax reassessment , raising property taxes , and making it difficult to lease the building at competitive prices .
wsj_1820	15	Real estate industry executives said Sears ' investment banker , Goldman , Sachs & Co. , sought financing in Japan .
wsj_1820	16	However , Japanese authorities apparently were concerned that a refinancing also would attract too much publicity .
wsj_1820	17	Sears then went back to AEW , the Boston pension adviser that had proposed a convertible debt deal during the first round of bids last spring .
wsj_1820	18	AEW has $ 3.5 billion of real estate investments nationwide , according to a spokesman .
wsj_1821	0	Tandy Corp. said it signed a definitive agreement to acquire two units of Datatronic AB of Stockholm for cash .
wsj_1821	1	The amount was n't disclosed .
wsj_1821	2	The electronics maker and retailer previously estimated the sale price at between $ 100 million and $ 200 million for Datatronic 's Victor microcomputer and Micronic hand-held computer subsidiaries .
wsj_1821	3	In addition , Tandy will acquire rights to the Victor and Micronic names for computers .
wsj_1821	4	During 1988 , the Datatronic subsidiaries had combined sales in excess of $ 200 million .
wsj_1821	5	The transaction will give Tandy a well-known European computer brand that includes 2,700 dealers and distributors marketing to medium-sized business and educational institutions .
wsj_1821	6	Closing of the transaction is subject to certain conditions and regulatory approvals , the company said .
wsj_1823	0	The average publicly offered commodity fund fell 4.2 % in September , largely because of the volatile markets in foreign currencies , according to Norwood Securities .
wsj_1823	1	The firm said that losers outnumbered gainers by more than three to one among the 122 funds it tracks .
wsj_1823	2	For the first nine months of the year , Norwood said the average fund has lost 3.3 % .
wsj_1827	0	Northrop Corp. 's third-quarter net income fell 25 % to $ 21.5 million , or 46 cents a share , while General Dynamics Corp. reported nearly flat earnings of $ 76.5 million , or $ 1.83 a share .
wsj_1827	1	Los Angeles-based Northrop recorded an 8.2 % decline in sales as B-2 Stealth bomber research-and-development revenue continued to ebb and high costs on some other programs cut into profit .
wsj_1827	2	The aerospace concern earned $ 28.8 million , or 61 cents a share , a year earlier .
wsj_1827	3	Sales in the latest period were $ 1.25 billion , down from $ 1.36 billion in the 1988 quarter .
wsj_1827	4	At St. Louis-based General Dynamics , sales rose 10 % to $ 2.52 billion from $ 2.29 billion .
wsj_1827	5	It earned $ 76.4 million , or $ 1.82 a share , in the 1988 quarter .
wsj_1827	6	General Dynamics credited significant earnings gains in its general aviation and material service segments , an earnings recovery in submarine operations , and higher military aircraft sales .
wsj_1827	7	Northrop said sales fell because of the decline in B-2 development dollars from the government as the plane continues its initial production stage and because fewer F/A-18 fighter sections are being produced in its subcontract work with prime contractor McDonnell Douglas Corp .
wsj_1827	8	In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange , Northrop shares closed at $ 21.125 , off 25 cents .
wsj_1827	9	General Dynamics closed at $ 54.875 , up 50 cents .
wsj_1827	10	Northrop , which since early 1988 has declined to accept fixed-price contracts for research and development , said earnings were hurt by excessive costs on a number of such contracts won years ago .
wsj_1827	11	Among them were the ALQ-135 electronic countermeasures system for the F-15 fighter .
wsj_1827	12	Northrop 's interest expense also soared to $ 35 million from $ 17 million a year ago .
wsj_1827	13	It said debt remained at the $ 1.22 billion that has prevailed since early 1989 , although that compared with $ 911 million at Sept. 30 , 1988 .
wsj_1827	14	The backlog of undelivered orders at Northrop on Sept. 30 was $ 4.68 billion , down from $ 5.16 billion a year earlier .
wsj_1827	15	For the nine months , Northrop reported a net loss of $ 46.9 million , or $ 1 a share , compared with profit of $ 190.3 million , or $ 4.05 a share , in 1988 .
wsj_1827	16	Sales dipped 3.6 % to $ 3.92 billion from $ 4.07 billion .
wsj_1827	17	At General Dynamics , factors reducing earnings in the military aircraft segment included higher levels of cost-sharing in development of the Advanced Tactical Fighter , and the high cost of an advanced version of the F-16 fighter .
wsj_1827	18	F-16 deliveries also have fallen `` slightly behind schedule , '' although a return to the previous schedule is expected in 1990 , the company said .
wsj_1827	19	Backlog at General Dynamics rose to $ 16.5 billion from $ 15.8 billion .

wsj_1828	0	Lotus Development Corp. reported a surprisingly strong 51 % increase in third-quarter net income on a 32 % sales gain , buoyed by strong demand for a new version of its 1-2-3 computer spreadsheet .
wsj_1828	1	The results topped analysts ' expectations and the earnings growth of competitors , prompting traders to all but forget the product-launch delays that bogged down the company for much of the past two years .
wsj_1828	2	Yesterday , in heavy , national over-the-counter trading , Lotus shares rose to $ 32.50 , up $ 1.25 apiece , capping a threemonth run-up of more than 40 % .
wsj_1828	3	Lotus said net rose to $ 23 million , or 54 cents a share , on sales of $ 153.9 million .
wsj_1828	4	A year ago , net was $ 14.3 million , or 31 cents a share , on sales of $ 116.8 million .
wsj_1828	5	For the nine months , net of $ 38.5 million , or 92 cents a share , trailed the year earlier 's $ 49.9 million , or $ 1.08 a share .
wsj_1828	6	Sales rose to $ 406 million from $ 356 million the year earlier .
wsj_1828	7	In the first half , Lotus struggled to keep market share with costly promotions while customers awaited the launch of 1-2-3 Release 3 , the upgraded spreadsheet software .
wsj_1828	8	Lotus 's results were about 10 % higher than analysts ' average expectations and compared favorably with the 36 % earnings rise reported a day earlier by rival Microsoft Corp. of Redmond , Wash .
wsj_1828	9	The company said results were bolstered by upgrades to Release 3 by previous customers and improved profit margins , the result of manufacturing-cost controls .
wsj_1828	10	Rick Sherlund , a Goldman Sachs analyst , said Lotus had upgrade revenue of about $ 22 million in the quarter , twice what he had expected .
wsj_1828	11	Also , he estimated unit shipments of 1-2-3 in all its forms were about 315,000 , up 7 % from 1988 's quarterly average .
wsj_1828	12	Demand for the new version was enabling Lotus to raise prices with distributors and to hold market share against Microsoft and other competitors that tried to exploit the earlier delays in Release 3 's launch , Mr. Sherlund added .
wsj_1828	13	He estimated that 1-2-3 outsold Microsoft 's Excel spreadsheet by four-to-one in the quarter , and held a 70 % or better share of the spreadsheet market .

wsj_1837	2	On Oct. 5 , the company estimated after-tax effects on the year 's earnings would be `` at least '' $ 1.3 million .
wsj_1837	3	Yesterday , the company said the negative after-tax effect on earnings for the year will be about $ 3.3 million .

wsj_1837	5	Bank Building , which expects to report a fourth-quarter loss , said it engaged advisers to `` explore financial alternatives for the company including the possible sale of the company or one or more of its units . ''
wsj_1837	6	Company auditors are continuing their review , and final restated figures are n't yet available .
wsj_1837	7	Bank Building earlier said the restatement is necessitated by `` certain errors in recording receivables and payables '' at its Loughman Cabinet division .

wsj_1840	0	The Chicago Mercantile Exchange said it fined Capcom Futures Inc. $ 500,000 and accepted its withdrawal from membership as part of a settlement of disciplinary actions against the firm .
wsj_1840	1	Capcom Futures is a Chicago subsidiary of Capcom Financial Services Ltd. , a London financial firm that was implicated last year in a scheme to launder drug money .
wsj_1840	2	The case is pending .
wsj_1840	3	The firm was indicted in Tampa , Fla. , on money-laundering charges .
wsj_1840	4	In June , the Chicago Board of Trade said it suspended Capcom Financial .

wsj_1855	0	Friday 's stock market plunge claimed its second victim among the scores of futures and options trading firms here .
wsj_1855	1	Petco Options , an options trading firm owned by the family of the deceased former Chicago Board of Trade chairman Ralph Peters , is getting out of the trade clearing , or processing and guaranteeing , business after sustaining a multimillion dollar loss Friday , options industry officials said .
wsj_1855	2	Nearly 75 options traders on the Chicago Board Options Exchange who cleared trades through Petco , including a handful of traders who lost between $ 500,000 to $ 1 million themselves as a result of Friday 's debacle , are trying to transfer their business to other clearing firms , CBOE members said .
wsj_1855	3	Timothy Vincent , Petco chief executive officer , confirmed that Petco was withdrawing from the clearing business .
wsj_1855	4	`` The owners of the company got a look at the potential risks in this business , and after Monday they felt they did n't want to be exposed any more , '' he said .
wsj_1855	5	He added that Petco remained in compliance with all industry capital requirements during the market 's rapid plunge Friday and Monday 's rebound .
wsj_1855	6	A CBOE spokeswoman declined comment on Petco .
wsj_1855	7	Over the weekend Fossett Corp. , another options trading firm , transferred the clearing accounts of about 160 traders to First Options of Chicago , a unit of Continental Bank Corp. , because it could n't meet regulatory capital requirements after Friday 's market slide .
wsj_1855	8	The unprecedented transfer of accounts underscored the options industry 's desire not to have its credibility tarnished by potentially widespread trading defaults on Monday .
wsj_1855	9	The CBOE , American Stock Exchange , Options Clearing Corp. and Stephen Fossett , owner of Fossett , joined in putting up $ 50 million to guarantee the accounts at First Options .
wsj_1855	10	The head of another small options clearing firm , who asked not to be identified , said that the heightened volatility in the financial markets in recent years makes it increasingly difficult for any but the largest financial trading firms to shoulder the risk inherent in the highly leveraged options and futures business .
wsj_1855	11	Prior to the introduction of financial futures in the late 1970s , most trading firms clustered around the LaSalle Street financial district here were family operations handed down from one generation to the next .
wsj_1855	12	Most also were relatively undercapitalized compared with the size of most Wall Street securities firms .
wsj_1855	13	Mr. Peters , a LaSalle Street legend among the post-World War II generation of commodity traders , was rumored to have amassed a multimillion-dollar fortune from commodity trading and other activities by the time he died in May .
wsj_1857	0	Insurers face the prospect of paying out billions of dollars for damages caused by this week 's California earthquake .
wsj_1857	1	Getting a grip on the extent of the damages is proving a far more difficult task than what insurers faced after Hurricane Hugo ripped through the Caribbean and the Carolinas last month .
wsj_1857	2	The earthquake 's toll , including possible deep structural damage , goes far beyond the more easily observed damage from a hurricane , says George Reider , a vice president in Aetna Life & Casualty Insurance Co. 's claims division .
wsj_1857	3	But investors are betting that the financial and psychological impact of the earthquake , coming so soon after the hurricane , will help stem more than two years of intense price-cutting wars among business insurers .
wsj_1857	4	Reflecting that logic , insurance-company stocks posted strong gains .
wsj_1857	5	Aetna and other insurers are hiring engineers and architects to help them assess structural damage .
wsj_1857	6	Most insurers already have mobilized their `` catastrophe '' teams to begin processing claims from their policyholders in northern California .
wsj_1857	7	Since commercial air travel is interrupted , Aetna , based in Hartford , Conn. , chartered three planes to fly claims adjusters into Sacramento and then planned for them to drive to the Bay area .
wsj_1857	8	About 25 adjusters were dispatched yesterday afternoon , along with laptop computers , cellular phones and blank checks .
wsj_1857	9	Some adjusters , already in other parts of California , drove to the disaster area with recreational vehicles and mobile homes that could be used as makeshift claims-processing centers .
wsj_1857	10	Insurers will be advertising 800 numbers -- probably on the radio -- that policyholders can call to get assistance on how to submit claims .
wsj_1857	11	State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. , the largest home and auto insurer in California , believes the losses from the earthquake could be somewhat less than the $ 475 million in damages it expects to pay out for claims resulting from Hurricane Hugo .
wsj_1857	12	State Farm , based in Bloomington , Ind. , is also the largest writer of personal-property earthquake insurance in California .
wsj_1857	13	Earthquake insurance is sold as a separate policy or a specific endorsement `` rider '' on a homeowner 's policy in California , because of the area 's vulnerability to earthquakes .
wsj_1857	14	State Farm said about 25 % of its policyholders in California have also purchased earthquake insurance .
wsj_1857	15	Allstate Insurance Co. , a unit of Sears , Roebuck & Co. , said about 23 % of its personal property policyholders -- about 28 % in the San Franciso area -- also have earthquake coverage .
wsj_1857	16	The Association of California Insurance Companies estimated damage to residential property could total $ 500 million , but only $ 100 million to $ 150 million is insured , it said .
wsj_1857	17	Officials from the American Insurance Association 's property-claim service division , which coordinates the efforts of the claims adjusters in an area after a natural disaster , will be flying to San Francisco today .
wsj_1857	18	They expect to have a preliminary estimate of the damages in a day or two .
wsj_1857	19	Roads and bridges in the Bay area appear to have suffered some of the most costly damage .
wsj_1857	20	Highways , such as the section of Interstate 880 that collapsed in Oakland , generally do n't have insurance coverage .
wsj_1857	21	Industry officials say the Bay Bridge -- unlike some bridges -- has no earthquake coverage , either , so the cost of repairing it probably would have to be paid out of state general operating funds .
wsj_1857	22	However , the bridge , which charges a $ 1 toll each way , does have `` loss of income '' insurance to replace lost revenue if the operation of the bridge is interrupted for more than seven days .
wsj_1857	23	That coverage is provided by a syndicate of insurance companies including Fireman 's Fund Corp. , based in Novato , Calif. , and Cigna Corp. , based in Philadelphia .
wsj_1857	24	Earthquake-related claims are n't expected to cause significant financial problems for the insurance industry as a whole .
wsj_1857	25	Instead , even with the liabilities of two natural disasters in recent weeks , analysts said the total capital of the industry is likely to be higher at year end than it was at midyear .
wsj_1857	26	Indeed , the earthquake could contribute to a turnaround in the insurance cycle in a couple of ways .
wsj_1857	27	For example , insurers may seek to limit their future exposure to catastrophes by increasing the amount of reinsurance they buy .
wsj_1857	28	Such increased demand for reinsurance , along with the losses the reinsurers will bear from these two disasters , are likely to spur increases in reinsurance prices that will later be translated into an overall price rise .
wsj_1857	29	Reinsurance is protection taken out by the insurance firms themselves .
wsj_1857	30	`` We are saying this is the breaking point , this is the event that will change the psychology of the marketplace , '' said William Yankus , an analyst with Conning & Co. , a Hartford firm that specializes in the insurance industry .
wsj_1857	31	His firm , along with some others , issued new buy recommendations on insurer stocks yesterday .
wsj_1857	32	Among the insurance stocks , big gainers included American International Group , up $ 3.25 to $ 102.625 ; General Re Corp. , up $ 2.75 to $ 86.50 ; Aetna , up $ 2.375 to $ 59.50 ; and Marsh & McLennan Inc. , up $ 3.125 to $ 75.875 .
wsj_1857	33	Still , a few individual companies , most likely smaller ones , could be devastated .
wsj_1857	34	`` I think there is a damned good chance someone is going to hit the skids on this , '' said Oppenheimer & Co. analyst Myron Picoult .
wsj_1857	35	He suspects some insurers who had purchased reinsurance to limit their exposure to catastrophes will discover that reinsurance was used up by Hurricane Hugo .
wsj_1857	36	British , West German , Scandinavian and other overseas insurers are bracing for big claims from the San Francisco earthquake disaster .
wsj_1857	37	Although it 's unclear how much exposure the London market will face , U.K. underwriters traditionally have a large reinsurance exposure to U.S. catastrophe coverage .
wsj_1857	38	Jack Byrne , chairman of Fireman 's Fund , said this disaster will test the catastrophe reinsurance market , causing these rates to soar .
wsj_1857	39	The catastrophe losses sustained by insurers this year will probably be the worst on an inflation-adjusted basis since 1906 -- when another earthquake sparked the Great San Francisco Fire .
wsj_1857	40	Orin Kramer , an insurance consultant in New York , estimates that the 1906 San Francisco destruction , on an inflation-adjusted basis , included insured losses of $ 5.8 billion .
wsj_1857	41	He is estimating this week 's disaster will generate insured losses of $ 2 billion to $ 4 billion , following about $ 4 billion in costs to insurers from Hurricane Hugo .
wsj_1858	0	Silicon Graphics Inc. 's first-quarter profit rose sharply to $ 5.2 million , or 28 cents a share , from $ 1 million , or six cents a share , a year ago .

wsj_1858	2	Revenue rose 95 % to $ 86.4 million from $ 44.3 million the year earlier .
wsj_1858	3	In national over-the-counter trading , the company closed yesterday at $ 23.25 a share , down 25 cents .

wsj_1859	1	The buyer was n't identified .
wsj_1859	2	The company said it also is making progress in negotiating the buy-out of its design division by management .
wsj_1859	3	In addition , Hunter said it will use proceeds from a private placement of $ 8 million of preferred shares to purchase an interest in a start-up company to underwrite environmental impairment insurance .
wsj_1859	4	Hunter wants to concentrate its resources on the insurance business and on a project to store hazardous wastes in salt domes .
wsj_1861	0	Although two Baby Bells showed strong growth in access lines , usage and unregulated business revenue , one reported a modest gain in third-quarter net while the other posted a small drop .
wsj_1861	1	Ameritech Corp. 's earnings increased 2.8 % , after strong revenue gains were offset somewhat by refunds and rate reductions imposed by regulators in its Midwest territory .
wsj_1861	2	BellSouth Corp. 's third-quarter earnings dropped 3.8 % as a result of debt refinancing , the recent acquisition of a cellular and paging property and rate reductions in its Southeast territory .
wsj_1861	3	At BellSouth , based in Atlanta , customer access lines grew by 162,000 , or 3.5 % , during the 12-month period ended Sept .
wsj_1861	4	For the third quarter , total operating revenue grew 2.6 % to $ 3.55 billion from $ 3.46 billion .

wsj_1861	6	Overall access minutes of use increased 10.3 % and toll messages jumped 5.2 % .
wsj_1861	7	BellSouth Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John L. Clendenin said three factors accounted for the drop in third-quarter earnings .
wsj_1861	8	The refinancing of $ 481 million in long-term debt reduced net income by $ 22 million , or five cents a share , but in the long run will save more than $ 250 million in interest costs .
wsj_1861	9	The company previously said that the recent acquisition of Mobile Communications Corp. of America would dilute 1989 earnings by about 3 % .
wsj_1861	10	In addition , earnings were reduced by rate reductions in Florida , Kentucky , Alabama , Tennessee and Louisiana .
wsj_1861	11	At Ameritech , based in Chicago , customer access lines increased by 402,000 , or 2.6 % , and cellular mobile lines increased by 80,000 , or 62.3 % , for the 12-month period ended Sept. 30 .

wsj_1861	15	But network access revenue dropped 4 % and toll revenue dropped 1.4 % .

wsj_1862	0	The Wall Street Journal `` American Way of Buying '' Survey consists of two separate , door-to-door nationwide polls conducted for the Journal by Peter D. Hart Research Associates and the Roper Organization .
wsj_1862	1	The two surveys , which asked different questions , were conducted using national random probability samples .
wsj_1862	2	The poll conducted by Peter D. Hart Research Associates interviewed 2,064 adults age 18 and older from June 15 to June 30 , 1989 .
wsj_1862	3	The poll conducted by the Roper Organization interviewed 2,002 adults age 18 and older from July 7 to July 15 , 1989 .
wsj_1862	4	Responses were weighted on the basis of age and gender to conform with U.S. Census data .
wsj_1862	5	For each poll , the odds are 19 out of 20 that if pollsters had sought to survey every household in the U.S. using the same questionnaire , the findings would differ from these poll results by no more than 2 1/2 percentage points in either direction .
wsj_1862	6	The margin of error for subgroups -- for example , married women with children at home -- would be larger .
wsj_1862	7	In addition , in any survey , there is always the chance that other factors such as question wording could introduce errors into the findings .

wsj_1865	0	Valley National Corp. reported a third-quarter net loss of $ 72.2 million , or $ 3.65 a share , and suspended its quarterly dividend because of potential losses on its Arizona real estate holdings .
wsj_1865	1	The Phoenix-based holding company for Arizona 's largest bank said it added $ 121 million to its allowance for losses on loans and for real estate owned .
wsj_1865	2	The company earned $ 18.7 million , or 95 cents a share , a year earlier .
wsj_1865	3	For the nine months , Valley National posted a net loss of $ 136.4 million , or $ 6.90 a share .
wsj_1865	4	It had profit of $ 48.6 million , or $ 2.46 a share , in the 1988 period .
wsj_1865	5	Valley National had been paying a quarterly dividend of 36 cents a share .
wsj_1865	6	`` The Arizona real estate market continues to be depressed , and there is still uncertainty as to when values will recover , '' James P. Simmons , chairman , said .
wsj_1865	7	The decision to increase the loan-loss reserve and suspend the dividend is `` both prudent and in the best long-term interest of the shareholders , '' he said .
wsj_1865	8	Valley National said it made the decision on the basis of an `` overall assessment of the marketplace '' and the condition of its loan portfolio and after reviewing it with federal regulators .
wsj_1865	9	The addition to reserves comes on top of a provision of $ 199.7 million that was announced in June .
wsj_1865	10	In July , Moody 's downgraded $ 400 million of the company 's debt , saying the bank holding company had n't taken adequate write-offs against potential losses on real estate loans despite its second-quarter write-down .
wsj_1865	11	Richard M. Greenwood , Valley National 's executive vice president , said then that the company believed the write-downs were `` adequate '' and did n't plan to increase its reserves again .
wsj_1865	12	Bruce Hoyt , a banking analyst with Boettcher & Co. , a Denver brokerage firm , said Valley National `` is n't out of the woods yet . ''
wsj_1865	13	The key will be whether Arizona real estate turns around or at least stabilizes , he said .
wsj_1865	14	`` They 've stepped up to the plate to take the write-downs , but when markets head down , a company is always exposed to further negative surprises , '' Mr. Hoyt said .

wsj_1868	0	John V. Holmes , an investment-newsletter publisher , and three venture-capital firms he organized were enjoined from violating the registration provisions of the securities laws governing investment companies .
wsj_1868	1	As part of an agreement that settled charges brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission , a receiver was also appointed for the three venture-capital firms .
wsj_1868	2	Mr. Holmes was the subject of a page one profile in The Wall Street Journal in 1984 , after the SEC questioned him about ties between him and companies he touted in a newsletter .
wsj_1868	3	In 1986 , in another consent agreement with the SEC , Mr. Holmes was enjoined from violating the stock-registration and anti-fraud provisions of the securities laws .
wsj_1868	4	Without any admission or denial of guilt by Mr. Holmes , that agreement settled SEC charges that Mr. Holmes sold unregistered securities and misled investors .
wsj_1868	5	In charges filed last week in federal district court in Charlotte , N.C. , the SEC alleged that Venture Capitalists Inc. , Venture Finance Corp. and New Ventures Fund Inc. , all of Charlotte , failed repeatedly to file proper documents .
wsj_1868	6	The SEC also charged that Mr. Holmes acted as an officer or director of New Ventures , in violation of his previous consent agreement .
wsj_1868	7	`` Some companies were delinquent in filings and other actions , all of which cost money , '' Mr. Holmes said .
wsj_1868	8	Two of Mr. Holmes 's business associates who worked for Venture Capitalists , Kimberly Ann Smith and Frederick Byrum , also consented to being enjoined from violations of registration provisions of the securities laws .

wsj_1869	0	Senate Republicans have settled on a proposal that would cut the capital-gains tax for individuals and corporations .
wsj_1869	1	At the same time , a small group of Senate Democrats are working on a similar plan and may introduce it soon .
wsj_1869	2	Sen. Bob Packwood R. , Ore. , the lead sponsor of the GOP proposal , said he intends to unveil the plan today and to offer it as an amendment to whatever legislation comes along , particularly this month 's bill to raise the federal borrowing limit .
wsj_1869	3	He gave 10-to-1 odds that a capital-gains tax cut of some sort would be approved this year , though it probably wo n't be included in the pending deficit-reduction bill .
wsj_1869	4	He added that he expects to talk to the Democrats who also wanted to cut the gains tax about drafting a joint proposal .
wsj_1869	5	For individuals , the Packwood plan would exclude from income 5 % of the gain from the sale of a capital asset held for more than one year .
wsj_1869	6	The exclusion would rise five percentage points for each year the asset was held until it reached a maximum of 35 % .
wsj_1869	7	The exclusion would apply to assets sold after Oct. 1 , 1989 .
wsj_1869	8	As an alternative , he said , taxpayers could chose to reduce their gains by an inflation index .
wsj_1869	9	For corporations , the top tax rate on the sale of assets held for more than three years would be cut to 33 % from the current top rate of 34 % .
wsj_1869	10	That rate would gradually decline to as little as 29 % for corporate assets held for 15 years .
wsj_1869	11	The Packwood plan would also include a proposal , designed by Sen. William Roth R. , Del. , that would expand and alter the deduction for individual retirement accounts .
wsj_1869	12	The Roth plan would create a new , non-deductible IRA from which money could be withdrawn tax-free not only for retirement , but also for the purchase of a first home and to pay education and medical expenses .
wsj_1869	13	Current IRAs could be rolled over into the new IRAs but would be subject to tax .
wsj_1869	14	For their part , the group of Democrats are working on a plan that , like the Packwood proposal , would grant larger exclusions to assets the longer they were held by individuals and companies .
wsj_1869	15	Newly acquired assets would get a bigger break than those currently held .
wsj_1869	16	An extra exclusion would be given to long-held stock in small and medium-size corporations just starting up .
wsj_1869	17	No one in the Senate is considering the capital-gains plan passed by the House .
wsj_1869	18	That plan would provide a 30 % exclusion to assets sold over a 2 1/2-year period ending Dec. 31 , 1991 .
wsj_1869	19	After then , the House measure would boost the tax rate to 28 % and exclude from tax the gain attributable to inflation .
wsj_1869	20	Senators are focusing on making a capital-gains differential permanent .
wsj_1869	21	Separately , Chairman Dan Rostenkowski D. , Ill . of the House Ways and Means Committee said he did n't want the capital-gains tax cut or any other amendments attached to the pending bill raising the federal borrowing limit .
wsj_1869	22	The current debt limit expires Oct. 31 .
wsj_1869	23	He also urged House and Senate negotiators to rid the deficit-reduction bill of all provisions that increase the budget deficit , including the House-passed capital-gains provision .

wsj_1872	3	Refcorp , created by the thrift-overhaul law enacted in August , will use the proceeds to merge or sell off ailing savings-and-loan institutions .
wsj_1872	4	Congress authorized $ 50 billion to be borrowed to pay for the thrift bailout .

wsj_1873	0	G.D. Searle & Co. , a Monsanto Co. unit , is launching a program to give consumers more information about its drugs when doctors prescribe them .
wsj_1873	1	Called Patients in the Know , the program features fact sheets designed to be easy to understand .
wsj_1873	2	The sheets tell how the medicine works , describe how to use it and list its possible side effects .
wsj_1873	3	They are designed to be given to patients by their doctors when the medicines are prescribed and include space for the doctor to write special instructions .
wsj_1873	4	In addition , Searle will give pharmacists brochures on the use of prescription drugs for distribution in their stores .
wsj_1873	5	Consumer groups have long advocated that drug companies and doctors make more information available to patients .
wsj_1873	6	`` We believe that every drug that 's marketed to a consumer should have a consumer label , '' said Douglas Teich of the Public Citizen Health Research Group , a Ralph Nader affiliate .
wsj_1873	7	Dr. Teich said Searle is `` the only company I know that voluntarily '' will make consumer information available .
wsj_1873	8	According to federal officials and drug-industry studies , nearly half of the 1.6 billion prescriptions filled each year are n't used properly , meaning that money is wasted on some prescriptions and patients are deprived of the benefits of medication .
wsj_1873	9	`` We think it 's very important to provide as much information as possible on the drugs consumers take , '' said Searle Chairman Sheldon Gilgore .

wsj_1879	0	Pinnacle West Capital Corp. said it suspended indefinitely its common stock dividend and reported a 91 % plunge in third-quarter net income .
wsj_1879	1	The announcement , made after the close of trading , caught analysts by surprise .
wsj_1879	2	The company closed at $ 12 a share , down 62.5 cents , in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange .
wsj_1879	3	Pinnacle West slashed its quarterly dividend to 40 cents per share from 70 cents in December , saying at the time that it believed the new , lower dividend was `` sustainable . ''
wsj_1879	4	A company spokesman said the decision to eliminate the dividend resulted from a quarterly appraisal and that circumstances had changed since the December announcement .
wsj_1879	5	He declined to elaborate .
wsj_1879	6	Edward J. Tirello Jr. , an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. , speculated that the sudden dividend elimination presages an expensive agreement with thrift regulators over the company 's insolvent MeraBank savings and loan unit .
wsj_1879	7	Analysts have estimated that Pinnacle West may have to inject between $ 300 million and $ 400 million into the MeraBank unit before turning the thrift over to federal regulators .
wsj_1879	8	The latest financial results at the troubled utility and thrift holding company , based in Phoenix , Ariz. , reflect continuing problems at MeraBank and losses in real-estate , venture-capital and uranium-mining operations .
wsj_1879	9	Third-quarter net income slid to $ 5.1 million , or six cents a share , from $ 56 million , or 65 cents , a year earlier .
wsj_1879	10	Utility operations , the only company unit operating in the black in the latest period , had a 26 % drop in profit , to $ 86.3 million , largely as a result of outages at the company 's huge Palo Verde nuclear facility and the cost of purchased replacement power .
wsj_1879	11	In other operations , losses at MeraBank totaled $ 85.7 million in the latest quarter , compared with a $ 2.5 million profit a year earlier .
wsj_1879	12	The latest quarter includes a $ 42.7 million addition to loan-loss reserves .
wsj_1879	13	As recently as August , the company said it did n't foresee a need for substantial additions to reserves .
wsj_1879	14	Pinnacle 's SunCor Development Co . real-estate unit 's loss narrowed to $ 13.8 million from $ 78.4 million .
wsj_1879	15	The latest period included a $ 9 million write-down on undeveloped land , while the year-earlier period included a $ 46 million reserve for real-estate losses .
wsj_1879	16	Losses at its Malapai Resources Co . uranium-mining unit narrowed to $ 3.4 million from $ 18 million a year ago , which included a $ 9 million write-down of utility inventories .

wsj_1880	0	Equitec Financial Group said it will ask as many as 100,000 investors in 12 of its public real-estate limited partnerships to give approval to rolling them up into a new master limited partnership .
wsj_1880	1	Under the proposal by Equitec , a financially troubled real-estate syndicator , New York-based Hallwood Group Inc. would replace Equitec as the newly formed master limited partnership 's general partner and manager .
wsj_1880	2	Shares of the new partnership would trade on an exchange like a stock .
wsj_1880	3	Hallwood is a merchant bank whose activities include the ownership , management and financial restructuring of shopping centers , office buildings , apartments and other real estate .
wsj_1880	4	In a statement , Equitec Chairman Richard L. Saalfeld said the transfer will benefit both the company and investors in the 12 limited partnerships included in the proposed rollup .
wsj_1880	5	While he did n't describe the partnerships ' financial condition , he said their operations `` continue to drain the resources of Equitec . ''
wsj_1880	6	Equitec posted a $ 3.3 million net loss in the second quarter on $ 11.8 million of revenue , compared with a net loss of $ 12.9 million in the year-earlier period on revenue of $ 9.1 million .
wsj_1880	7	In New York Stock Exchange composite trading , Equitec closed at $ 2.625 a share , unchanged .
wsj_1880	8	Because of Tuesday 's earthquake in Northern California , company officials could n't immediately be reached for additional comment .
wsj_1880	9	A spokesman for Hallwood said the 12 limited partnerships , which were marketed by brokerage firms and financial planners between 1979 and 1984 , raised several hundred million dollars from investors .
wsj_1881	0	With airline deals in a tailspin , legendary Wall Street trader Michael Steinhardt could have trouble parachuting out of USAir Group , traders say .
wsj_1881	1	Only a week ago , when airline buy-out fever was already winding down , Mr. Steinhardt was engaged in a duel with USAir .
wsj_1881	2	He was threatening to take over the carrier , after spending an estimated $ 167 million to build an 8.4 % USAir stake for his investment clients .
wsj_1881	3	The would-be raider even hired an investment banker to give teeth to his takeover threat , which was widely interpreted as an effort to flush out an acquirer for USAir , or for his own stake .
wsj_1881	4	In fighting USAir , Mr. Steinhardt was pitted against another investor , billionnaire Warren Buffett , who bought into USAir to help fend off Mr. Steinhardt .
wsj_1881	5	Mr. Buffett 's firm , Berkshire Hathaway , holds a much bigger stake in the carrier than Mr. Steinhardt 's firm , Steinhardt Partners .
wsj_1881	6	Now , in the wake of UAL 's troubles in financing its buy-out , the airline raiding game has been grounded .
wsj_1881	7	Instead of hoping to sell his USAir stake at analysts ' estimated buy-out price of $ 80 a share , Mr. Steinhardt is stuck with roughly 3.7 million USAir shares that cost him $ 45 , on average , but yesterday closed at 40 1/2 , up 1/4 , in New York Stock Exchange composite trading .
wsj_1881	8	`` It does n't make sense to parachute out at this price , '' Mr. Steinhardt says , though he has stopped his takeover talk and now commends USAir managers ' `` operating skills . ''
wsj_1881	9	At the current price , the USAir holding represents 9 % of all the assets that Mr. Steinhardt manages .
wsj_1881	10	A week ago , USAir stock briefly soared above 52 after a report in USA Today that Mr. Steinhardt might launch a hostile bid for the carrier , though takeover speculators say they were skeptical .
wsj_1881	11	`` If USAir is worth 80 as a takeover and the stock went to 52 , the market was saying Steinhardt 's presence was n't worth anything , in terms of getting a deal done , '' says a veteran takeover speculator .
wsj_1881	12	Traders say this all goes to show that even the smartest money manager can get infected with crowd passions .
wsj_1881	13	In trying to raid USAir , Mr. Steinhardt abandoned his usual role as a passive investor , and ran into snags .
wsj_1881	14	Moreover , unlike Mr. Buffett , who often holds big stakes in companies for years , Mr. Steinhardt has n't in the past done much long-term investing .
wsj_1881	15	Mr. Steinhardt , who runs about $ 1.7 billion for Steinhardt Partners , made his name as a gunslinging trader , moving in and out of stocks with agility -- enriching himself and his investment clients .
wsj_1881	16	Meanwhile , his big losses , for instance in 1987 's crash , generally have been trading losses .
wsj_1881	17	So , some see a special irony in the fact that Mr. Steinhardt , the trader , now is encumbered with a massive , illiquid airline holding .
wsj_1881	18	Analysts say USAir stock might lose four or five points if the Steinhardt stake was dumped all at once .
wsj_1881	19	As a result , Mr. Steinhardt must reconcile himself to selling USAir at a loss , or to holding the shares as an old-fashioned investment .
wsj_1881	20	`` Long-term investing -- that 's not Steinhardt 's style , '' chuckles an investor who once worked at Steinhardt Partners .
wsj_1881	21	`` He does n't usually risk that much unless he thinks he has an ace in the hole , '' adds another Steinhardt Partners alumnus .
wsj_1881	22	In recent days , traders say USAir has been buying its own shares , as part of a program to retire about eight million USAir shares , though the carrier wo n't discuss its buy-back program .
wsj_1881	23	If USAir stepped up its share purchases , that might be a way for Mr. Steinhardt to get out , says Timothy Pettee , a Merrill Lynch analyst .
wsj_1881	24	But USAir might not want to help Mr. Steinhardt , he adds .
wsj_1881	25	In 1987 , USAir Chairman Edwin Colodny stonewalled when Trans World Airlines Chairman Carl Icahn threatened to take over the carrier .
wsj_1881	26	Mr. Icahn , a much more practiced raider than Mr. Steinhardt , eventually sold a big USAir stake at a tiny profit through Bear , Stearns .
wsj_1881	27	Mr. Steinhardt also could take that route .
wsj_1881	28	He confers big trading commissions on Wall Street firms .
wsj_1881	29	However , with airline stocks cratering , he might not get a very good price for his shares , traders say .
wsj_1881	30	Especially galling for Mr. Steinhardt , say people close to him , is that USAir 's Mr. Colodny wo n't even take his telephone calls .
wsj_1881	31	While USAir is n't considered absolutely takeover-proof , its defenses , including the sale in August of a 12 % stake in the company to Mr. Buffett 's Berkshire Hathaway , are pretty strong .
wsj_1881	32	USAir 's deal with Mr. Buffett `` was n't exactly a shining example of shareholder democracy , '' Mr. Steinhardt says .
wsj_1881	33	Since last April , the investor has made seven so-called 13D filings in USAir , as he bought and sold the company 's stock .
wsj_1881	34	Such disclosures of big holdings often are used by raiders to try to scare a company 's managers , and to stir interest in the stock .
wsj_1881	35	But of course it would be highly unusual for an investment fund such as Steinhardt Partners to take over a company .
wsj_1881	36	USAir and Mr. Buffett wo n't talk about Mr. Steinhardt at all .
wsj_1881	37	Analysts say USAir has great promise .
wsj_1881	38	By the second half of 1990 , USAir stock could hit 60 , says Helane Becker of Shearson Lehman Hutton .
wsj_1881	39	She thinks traders should buy the stock if it tumbles to 35 .
wsj_1881	40	But meanwhile , USAir is expected to show losses or lackluster profit for several quarters as it tries to digest Piedmont Airlines , which it acquired .
wsj_1881	41	Moreover , some investors think a recession or renewed airfare wars will pummel airline stocks in coming months .
wsj_1881	42	However , Mr. Steinhardt says he 's `` comfortable holding USAir as an investment . ''
wsj_1881	43	While he has bought and sold some USAir shares in recent days , he says that contrary to rumors , he has n't tried to unload his holding .
wsj_1881	44	Mr. Steinhardt adds that he bought USAir stock earlier this year as `` part of a fundamental investment in the airline group . ''
wsj_1881	45	In 1989 , Mr. Steinhardt says he made money trading in Texas Air , AMR and UAL .
wsj_1881	46	Overall , his investments so far this year are showing gains of about 20 % , he adds .
wsj_1881	47	Does Mr. Steinhardt regret his incursion into the takeover-threat game ?
wsj_1881	48	People close to the investor say that was an experiment he is unlikely to repeat .
wsj_1881	49	`` I do n't think you 'll find I 'm making a radical change in my traditional investment style , '' Mr. Steinhardt says .
wsj_1882	0	Addington Resources Inc. said it called for redemption on Nov. 21 its $ 25.8 million outstanding of 8 % convertible subordinated debentures due 2013 .
wsj_1882	1	The debentures were issued in the face amount of $ 46 million on July 11 , 1988 , the Ashland , Ky. , coal mining , water transportation and construction company said .
wsj_1882	2	The company said the redemption is permitted because the price of Addington 's stock has equaled or exceeded $ 19.60 for 20 consecutive trading days , a condition set in the terms of the debentures .
wsj_1882	3	Debenture holders are expected to convert most of the debentures into common because the value of the stock received in a conversion would exceed the $ 1,103.11 redemption price .
wsj_1883	0	Commodore International Ltd. said it will report a loss for the first quarter ended Sept. 30 because sales of personal computers for the home market remained weak in some major countries .
wsj_1883	1	That will mark the second consecutive quarterly loss for Commodore and will raise additional questions about whether it can sustain the turnaround it had seemed to be engineering .
wsj_1883	2	Commodore , West Chester , Pa. , had said in August that it was consolidating manufacturing to cut costs and expected to be profitable in the fiscal first quarter .
wsj_1883	3	Commodore said that its announcement is based on preliminary information and that the situation could look different by the time final results are announced early next month .
wsj_1883	4	In fact , Commodore 's fiscal fourth-quarter loss was $ 2 million narrower than Commodore had expected a few weeks after the quarter closed .
wsj_1883	5	Still , even results approaching break-even would mark a sharp weakening compared with fiscal 1989 first-quarter earnings of $ 9.6 million , or 30 cents a share , on sales of $ 200.2 million .
wsj_1883	6	Reflecting concerns about Commodore 's outlook , its stock has plunged more than 50 % since May , closing yesterday unchanged at $ 8.875 a share in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange .
wsj_1883	7	The price can be expected to erode further , because the loss estimate came after the market closed .
wsj_1883	8	Commodore has seemed to be setting the stage recently for progress in the U.S. , where its personal-computer sales have been so dismal for years that Commodore is close to dropping off research firms ' market-share charts .
wsj_1883	9	Commodore has assembled an experienced management team , it has persuaded many more dealers to carry its products and it has unleashed a slick advertising campaign .
wsj_1883	10	But those represent long-term strategies that probably wo n't succeed quickly , even if they turn out to be the right ones .
wsj_1883	11	In the meantime , the strategies will increase expenses .
wsj_1883	12	Commodore had been counting on its consumer business to stay sufficiently healthy to support its efforts in other areas -- mainly in getting schools and businesses to use its Amiga , which has slick graphics yet has been slow to catch on because it is n't compatible with Apple Computer Inc. or International Business Machines Corp. hardware .
wsj_1883	13	But sales to consumers have become difficult during the past several months , even in West Germany , which has been by far Commodore 's strongest market .
wsj_1883	14	The Commodore 64 and 128 , mainly used for children 's educational software and games , had surprised market researchers by continuing to produce strong sales even though other low-profit personal computers now operate several times as fast and have much more memory .
wsj_1883	15	Commodore has said it expects sales to rebound , but market researchers have said that sales of the low-end products may finally be trailing off .
wsj_1885	0	Philip Morris Cos. posted a 20 % jump in third-quarter profit on a 45 % revenue increase , reflecting strength in the company 's cigarette , food and brewing businesses .
wsj_1885	1	Net income rose to $ 748 million , or 81 cents a share , from the year-earlier $ 621 million , or 67 cents a share .
wsj_1885	2	Per-share figures have been adjusted for a 4-for-1 stock split paid earlier this month .
wsj_1885	3	The New York-based tobacco , food and beer concern said revenue increased to $ 11.25 billion from $ 7.74 billion .
wsj_1885	4	In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange , Philip Morris closed at $ 43.375 , up 12.5 cents .
wsj_1885	5	Philip Morris disclosed little detailed information about performance by major business lines except to say that most , including Philip Morris U.S.A. , Kraft General Foods and Miller Brewing Co. , posted increased revenues .
wsj_1885	6	For the nine months , net increased 4.4 % to $ 2.08 billion , or $ 2.25 a share , from $ 2 billion , which included $ 273 million reflecting the effect of an accounting change .
wsj_1886	0	Granges Inc. , citing depressed gold prices , said it plans to suspend operations for an indefinite period at its Tartan gold mine in Manitoba .
wsj_1886	1	Granges said in Vancouver , British Columbia , that the production halt will be phased in over a 10-week period .
wsj_1886	2	Tartan currently produces gold at a cash operating cost of $ 393 an ounce , which is high by industry standards and $ 25 or so above the current spot price .
wsj_1886	3	Granges said it also plans in the third quarter to write down the carrying value of the Tartan mine by 2.5 million Canadian dollars US$ 2.12 million , and to write off most of the C$ 6.3 million carrying value of its Windflower gold property in British Columbia .
wsj_1886	4	Granges did n't say what impact the moves would have on total gold output or earnings , and company officials were n't available .
wsj_1887	0	Computer Associates International Inc. , Garden City , N.Y. , and Digital Equipment Corp. said they agreed to jointly develop software to help manage Digital 's Vax computers .
wsj_1887	1	Computer Associates has carved out a huge business selling such software for use in managing networks of International Business Machines Corp. computers but needs to find new markets if it is to maintain its growth rate of 30 % and more each year .
wsj_1887	2	The market for system-management software for Digital 's hardware is fragmented enough that a giant such as Computer Associates should do well there .
wsj_1887	3	At the same time , the market is smaller than the market for IBM-compatible software .
wsj_1887	4	For one thing , Digital , Maynard , Mass. , has sold fewer machines .
wsj_1887	5	In addition , its machines are typically easier to operate , so customers require less assistance from software .
wsj_1888	0	Wang Laboratories Inc. , Lowell , Mass. , beset by declining demand for its computers , reported a $ 62.1 million , 38-cents-a-share loss in its first quarter ended Sept. 30 .
wsj_1888	1	Revenue fell 12.7 % to $ 596.8 million from $ 684 million , although some of the decline was caused by discontinued operations .
wsj_1888	2	Wang had previously forecast a loss .
wsj_1888	3	The company reiterated that it expects another loss in the second quarter and for the full year , although it expects a profitable fourth quarter .
wsj_1888	4	A year ago , Wang had earnings of $ 13.1 million , or eight cents a share , in its first quarter , including a $ 3.1 million loss from discontinued operations .
wsj_1888	5	The latest period loss included a $ 12.9 pretax charge for severance payments .
wsj_1889	0	Dayton Hudson Corp. said it accepted for purchase seven million common shares at $ 62.875 each , under the terms of a Dutch auction self-tender offer .
wsj_1889	1	The offer expired at 12:01 a.m. yesterday .
wsj_1889	2	In a Dutch auction , the buyer sets a price range and holders give a price in that range at which they 're willing to sell their shares .
wsj_1889	3	The buyer then picks a price and buys shares at that price from holders who offered to sell at that price or lower .
wsj_1889	4	Dayton Hudson 's repurchase offer , representing about 9 % of its common shares outstanding , had established a range of between $ 60 and $ 65 for the buy-back .
wsj_1889	5	Dayton Hudson said it accepted all odd-lot shares tendered at or below the final $ 62.875 price ; the preliminary proration factor for other shares tendered at or below the final price is 98 % .
wsj_1889	6	The Minneapolis-based retailer said it expects to pay for the seven million shares next Thursday .
wsj_1889	7	Tendered shares not purchased will be returned to holders .
wsj_1889	8	In New York Stock Exchange composite trading , Dayton rose $ 1 to $ 61.125 .
wsj_1890	0	Continental Bank Corp. 's third-quarter net income slipped 11 % despite a big gain from the sale of the company 's London headquarters building .
wsj_1890	1	The $ 55 million gain on the sale was offset by lower interest income , poorer results from foreign-exchange trading and a $ 9 million loss on the sale of a unit , Securities Settlement Corp .
wsj_1890	2	Chicago-based Continental earned $ 65.2 million , or $ 1.04 a share , compared with $ 73.6 million , or $ 1.19 a share , a year earlier .
wsj_1890	3	The 1988 quarter also included one-time gains totaling about $ 35 million .
wsj_1890	4	The bank , which has loss reserves equal to about half its long-term and medium-term loans to less-developed nations , said it does n't think additional reserves are required .
wsj_1891	0	Enron Corp. said a subsidiary and two United Kingdom firms are studying the feasibility of constructing a 1,500 megawatt gas-fired power plant in northern England as an outgrowth of the government 's privatization program .
wsj_1891	1	Enron Power Corp. , a unit of the Houston natural gas pipeline company , would design , construct and run the plant .
wsj_1891	2	Gas to fuel it would be piped from the North Sea .
wsj_1891	3	A subsidiary of Britain 's Imperial Chemical Industries would buy electricity and steam from the proposed station .
wsj_1891	4	Surplus power would be sold on the open market , Enron said .
wsj_1891	5	Also participating in the study , Enron said , is the National Power division of Britain 's Central Electricity Generating Board .
wsj_1891	6	Upon privatization , National Power will be responsible for 70 % of the country 's power generating business .
wsj_1892	0	Viacom Inc. , New York , reported that its third-quarter loss widened to $ 21.7 million , or 41 cents a share , primarily because of interest expense of $ 70.1 million .
wsj_1892	1	A year ago , Viacom had a net loss of $ 56.9 million , or $ 1.07 a share .
wsj_1892	2	Interest expense in the 1988 third quarter was $ 75.3 million .
wsj_1892	3	In the year-ago quarter , Viacom also paid preferred stock dividends of $ 17 million ; Viacom exchanged its preferred stock for debt in March .
wsj_1892	4	The communications and entertainment company said revenue rose to $ 345.5 million , from $ 311.6 million .
wsj_1892	5	Viacom attributed the improvement to higher earnings from operations in its networks segment , which includes the MTV and Showtime networks .
wsj_1892	6	Viacom said it also restructured bank debt under a $ 1.5 billion unsecured bank agreement that offers significant interest rate savings .
wsj_1892	7	Sumner M. Redstone , Viacom 's chairman , said Viacom `` emerged from our leveraged buy-out structure and gained substantial operating and financial flexibility through '' the bank pact .
wsj_1893	0	Trinova Corp. , Maumee , Ohio , said it is launching an extensive restructuring of its core business , and took a charge that resulted in a loss of $ 29.7 million , or 87 cents a share , for the third quarter .
wsj_1893	1	Trinova said it will close , move or overhaul 40 of its 170 manufacturing facilities and over the next three years cut 1,500 jobs from its current world-wide payroll of 22,300 employees .
wsj_1893	2	Most of the factory closings and job cutbacks will affect Trinova 's Aeroquip operations , which manufacture automotive plastics , hoses and other industrial and automotive parts .
wsj_1893	3	Hoses and plastics together account for about 42 % of Trinova 's total annual sales .
wsj_1893	4	In a separate announcement , Trinova said the Aeroquip group has agreed to sell its spring-brake , piston-brake and related businesses to Midland Brake Inc. of Branford , Conn .
wsj_1893	5	Terms were n't disclosed .
wsj_1893	6	To provide for the restructuring 's costs , Trinova said it took an after-tax charge of $ 38.5 million , or $ 1.13 a share , in the third quarter .
wsj_1893	7	The $ 29.7 million net loss compares with net income of $ 19.6 million , or 57 cents a share , a year earlier .
wsj_1893	8	Sales rose 8 % to $ 456.2 million from $ 422 million .
wsj_1893	9	Trinova closed at $ 25 , down $ 1 , in New York Stock Exchange composite trading .
wsj_1894	0	A group of investors , including Giancarlo Parretti 's Pathe Communications Corp. and Sasea Holding S.A. , have agreed to buy 76.66 % of Odeon Finanziaria , a financially troubled Italian TV station .
wsj_1894	1	Florio Fiorini , managing director of Geneva-based Sasea , said the investors would pay only a symbolic one lira for the station , `` but we have agreed to raise the capital that will enable the company to continue operating .
wsj_1894	2	It 's sort of a Chapter 11 situation , '' he added , referring to the U.S. bankruptcy law that protects companies from creditors while they restructure .
wsj_1894	3	Milan-based Odeon , which draws about 3 % of Italian TV viewers , has debt of 250 billion lire $ 181.9 million , Mr. Fiorini said .
wsj_1894	4	He added that details of the recapitalization still have to be worked out , but that Pathe will take 50 % of Odeon , Rome film producer Bruno Lucisano will take 10 % and the remaining 16.66 % , currently owned by Sasea , will eventually be sold to other investors .
wsj_1894	5	Calisto Tanzi , Odeon 's owner , will retain his 23.34 % stake .
wsj_1894	6	Italy 's Supreme Court this year ordered Parliament to write a law that will regulate media ownership .
wsj_1894	7	`` We think that it 's going to be far more favorable to own a station before the law is passed than to try to buy one afterward , '' Mr. Fiorini said .
wsj_1895	0	San Francisco area officials gave the media high marks for helping people find shelter and obtain emergency information after Tuesday 's catastrophic earthquake .
wsj_1895	1	`` The press has been doing an excellent job .
wsj_1895	2	They are telling people what roads are closed and just keeping the public informed has helped to keep the panic down , '' said James Ball , a station supervisor at Daly City Police Department .
wsj_1895	3	Mr. Ball noted that television stations featured people holding up phone books , explaining where to call for help .
wsj_1895	4	Radio stations provided an emergency number for people who smelled gas but did n't know how to turn off their gas supply .
wsj_1895	5	Kim Schwartz , a spokesperson for the American Red Cross in Los Angeles , said television and radio stations in San Francisco played a `` very positive role '' by providing the address of 28 shelters of the Red Cross and by giving out the Red Cross number for contributions to help earthquake victims 1-800-453-9000 .
wsj_1895	6	The San Francisco Examiner issued a special edition around noon yesterday that was filled entirely with earthquake news and information .
wsj_1895	7	The Examiner and the San Francisco Chronicle were able to publish despite Tuesday 's quake , which occurred close to deadline for many newspapers .
wsj_1896	0	Sterling Software Inc. said it lost its bid to supply software services to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration 's Ames Research Center at Moffett Field , Calif .
wsj_1896	1	Sterling , which estimated the value of the contract at $ 150 million , said NASA selected another bidder for final negotiations .
wsj_1896	2	In 1988 , Dallas-based Sterling protested a similar decision by NASA involving the same contract , claiming it had submitted the lowest bid .
wsj_1896	3	As a result , last March the General Services Administration board of contract appeals directed NASA to reopen negotiations on the contract .
wsj_1896	4	Sterling said it had requested a briefing by NASA but had not decided whether to protest the agency 's latest decision .
wsj_1898	0	Georgia Gulf Corp. , hurt by declining sales and falling chemical prices , said third-quarter earnings fell 13 % to $ 46.1 million from $ 53.1 million in the year-earlier period .
wsj_1898	1	Sales declined 10 % to $ 251.2 million from $ 278.7 million .
wsj_1898	2	The Atlanta-based chemical manufacturer said lower prices hurt margins for most products .
wsj_1898	3	`` We did see some relief in raw material costs , but it was n't sufficient to offset the drop in sales prices , '' James R. Kuse , the company 's chairman and chief executive officer said in a statement .
wsj_1898	4	On a per-share basis , quarterly earnings remained at $ 1.85 , the same as last year , because of the company 's share buy-back program .
wsj_1898	5	Georgia Gulf had 24.9 million shares outstanding on average in the quarter , compared with 28.6 million in the third quarter of 1988 , adjusted for a stock split paid in January 1989 .
wsj_1898	6	In composite New York Stock Exchange trading , stock in Georgia Gulf , which has been mentioned as a takeover candidate , rose $ 2.125 a share to close at $ 46.125 .
wsj_1899	0	This temblor-prone city dispatched inspectors , firefighters and other earthquake-trained personnel to aid San Francisco .
wsj_1899	1	But a secondary agenda among officials in the City of Angels was to learn about the disaster-contingency plans that work and those that do n't .
wsj_1899	2	Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley used the opportunity to push the City Council harder to pass a measure establishing a loss-recovery reserve of $ 100 million .
wsj_1899	3	The amount would help Los Angeles cope in the first few weeks after its own anticipated quake , while waiting for federal assistance to arrive .
wsj_1899	4	After San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos spoke on television of the need for building inspectors to check the soundness of buildings , Los Angeles dispatched 32 inspectors to help .
wsj_1899	5	And the county of Los Angeles placed its firefighters and sheriffs on alert , ready to send in reinforcements , and alerted San Francisco that the city has 1,000 hospital beds at its disposal .
wsj_1899	6	Two Los Angeles radio stations initiated Red Cross donation campaigns , and one Los Angeles bank manager forked over $ 150,000 of his own money for relief purposes , the Red Cross said .
wsj_1899	7	The Los Angeles Red Cross sent 2,480 cots , 500 blankets , and 300 pints of Type-O blood .

wsj_1900	0	The Arizona Corporations Commission authorized an 11.5 % rate increase at Tucson Electric Power Co. , substantially lower than recommended last month by a commission hearing officer and barely half the rise sought by the utility .
wsj_1900	1	The ruling follows a host of problems at Tucson Electric , including major write-downs , a 60 % slash in the common stock dividend and the departure of former Chairman Einar Greve during a company investigation of his stock sales .
wsj_1900	2	The Arizona regulatory ruling calls for $ 42 million in added revenue yearly , compared with a $ 57 million boost proposed by the commission hearing officer .
wsj_1900	3	The company had sought increases totaling $ 80.3 million , or 22 % .
wsj_1900	4	The decision was announced after trading ended .
wsj_1900	5	Tucson Electric closed at $ 20.875 a share , down 25 cents , in New York Stock Exchange composite trading .

wsj_1901	0	South Korean President Roh Tae Woo , brushing aside suggestions that the won be revalued again , said the currency 's current level against the dollar is `` appropriate . ''
wsj_1901	1	His comments , made in response to reporters ' questions at the National Press Club here , signaled that Seoul is resisting U.S. pressure for a further rise in the currency 's value .
wsj_1901	2	The U.S. wants a higher won to make South Korea 's exports more expensive and help trim Seoul 's trade surplus .
wsj_1901	3	Many South Korean business people want a devaluation instead , arguing that the won 's recent gains already have weakened the country 's export performance .
wsj_1901	4	Mr. Roh also said South Korea is taking steps that would free the won to respond to market forces .
wsj_1901	5	Seoul has pointed to its lack of a foreign exchange market as one reason the won 's value remains heavily controlled .
wsj_1901	6	Mr. Roh said a U.S. demand for the removal of South Korean import quotas on beef will be resolved `` satisfactorily '' but gave no hint when that will happen .
wsj_1901	7	Speaking to a joint meeting of Congress earlier , he said South Korea ca n't move quickly on such agricultural trade issues `` without causing political and social trauma .
wsj_1902	0	Great American Bank said its board approved the formation of a holding company enabling the savings bank to pursue nontraditional banking activities under a new federal law .
wsj_1902	1	The proposed holding company 's primary purpose would be to allow Great American to continue engaging in real estate development activities , it said .
wsj_1902	2	Those activities generated $ 26.1 million in operating profit last year .
wsj_1902	3	But according to Great American , such profits do n't count toward meeting the San Diego savings bank 's new capitalization requirements under 1989 federal law .

wsj_1904	0	Britain 's Monopolies and Mergers Commission Wednesday cleared Rhone-Poulenc S.A. 's purchase of a specialty bulk-chemical unit from Monsanto Co. , saying the purchase was unlikely to have any lasting impact on U.K. industrial consumers .
wsj_1904	1	The commission , which was asked to study the deal by the Department of Trade and Industry after its announcement in February , said the diversity of global supply of chemicals used in making analgesic drugs was great enough to offset the dominant U.K. market share Rhone-Poulenc would gain through the acquisition .
wsj_1904	2	The French chemical giant would hold an 80 % share of the U.K. market for salicylic acid , methyl salicylate and bulk aspirin .
wsj_1904	3	The commission found that if the British government attempted to block the merger , Rhone-Poulenc would likely respond by closing the salicylates plant Monsanto operates in Wales , removing the matter from U.K. jurisdiction .

wsj_1906	0	The House Ethics Committee officially cited Rep. Jim Bates D. , Calif . for sexually harassing two female employees , but did n't recommend formal disciplinary action .
wsj_1906	1	Rep. Bates said he accepted the finding , but one of the victims , Dorena Bertussi , denounced the ethics panel 's action as `` absurd . ''
wsj_1906	2	Acting more than a year after Ms. Bertussi filed a complaint , the panel issued a `` letter of reproval '' saying Rep. Bates had admitted conduct that violated a House rule forbidding discrimination against employees on account of their sex .

wsj_1907	0	Mesa Airlines said the takeover offer it received earlier this week from StatesWest Airlines is for a combination of cash and securities valued by StatesWest at $ 10 a Mesa share .
wsj_1907	1	Both companies are regional carriers in the Southwest .
wsj_1907	2	When it made the offer , StatesWest declined to disclose details and asked Mesa to do the same .
wsj_1907	3	But Farmington , N.M.-based Mesa said the offer was for $ 7 in cash and unspecified StatesWest securities valued at $ 3 a share .

wsj_1912	0	South Africa negotiated a new debt agreement with its major foreign creditors for about $ 8 billion of its foreign debt outstanding , said Chris Stals , governor of the Reserve Bank and the country 's chief debt negotiator .
wsj_1912	1	The new agreement will last for 3 1/2 years starting July 1 , 1990 , when the current agreement expires .
wsj_1912	2	The announcement coincides with the start of the Commonwealth Ministers Conference in Kuala Lumpur , where proposals for renewed sanctions against South Africa , including moves to block settling of a new debt agreement , were scheduled to be discussed .
wsj_1912	3	As with the previous pact , the new agreement covers the country 's debt `` inside the net , '' which applies mainly to repayments due to overseas creditor banks by the private sector .
wsj_1912	4	The agreement calls for South African debtors to make repayments in eight installments , starting in December of next year .
wsj_1912	5	The redemption then would be at 1.5 % of the total debt , increasing to 2.5 % in February 1991 , and to 3 % at six-month intervals thereafter .
wsj_1912	6	A revised provision would be included for the conversion of short-term claims inside the net to long-term loans outside the net .
wsj_1912	7	These claims would be repayable over a 10-year period .

wsj_1913	0	New York Times Co. said net income rose in the third quarter because of a one-time gain on the sale of the company 's cable-TV system .
wsj_1913	1	Net surged to $ 210.8 million , or $ 2.68 a share , from $ 26.7 million , or 33 cents a share , a year earlier .
wsj_1913	2	The latest quarter included a gain of $ 193.3 million , or $ 2.46 a share , from the sale of New York Times Cable , completed in August .
wsj_1913	3	Exclusive of the gain , operating profit declined 35 % to $ 16.4 million , or 21 cents a share , from $ 25.2 million , or 31 cents a share .
wsj_1913	4	The decline primarily reflected the dilution from acquiring McCall 's , Golf World U.S. and Sailing World magazines ; lower equity earnings from the forest-products group because of price discounting and an unfavorable exchange rate , and an 8.7 % decline in advertising linage at the New York Times , the company 's flagship newspaper .
wsj_1913	5	Advertising volume at the company 's 35 regional newspapers decreased 1.1 % .
wsj_1913	6	The company said the negative factors are expected to continue into next year .

wsj_1914	0	Democrat Gene Taylor won a special election to fill the congressional seat vacated by the death of Republican Larkin Smith , taking back the GOP 's lone redoubt in Mississippi 's House delegation .
wsj_1914	1	Mr. Taylor 's overwhelming victory against Republican Tom Anderson reclaims a seat the Republicans had held for 17 years and gives the Democrats their fifth victory in the seven special House elections held this year .
wsj_1914	2	Mr. Taylor , a 36-year-old state senator from Bay St. Louis , won 65 % of the vote in a district that has voted Republican in the past five presidential elections and that was once represented by Republican U.S. Sen. Trent Lott .
wsj_1914	3	Mr. Taylor 's victory was an embarrassment for both state and national Republicans .
wsj_1914	4	Mr. Anderson , a former Lott aide , received campaign assistance from the senator and from President Bush , who visited the district last week .
wsj_1914	5	Even so , Mr. Taylor carried all but one of the district 's dozen counties .

wsj_1916	0	Could the collapse of I-880 have been prevented ?
wsj_1916	1	That was the question structural engineers and California transportation officials were asking themselves yesterday as rescue workers began the gruesome task of trying to extract as many as 250 victims from beneath the concrete slabs of the double-deck Nimitz Freeway in Oakland that caved in during Tuesday 's temblor .
wsj_1916	2	After touring the area , California Gov. George Deukmejian late yesterday called for an inquiry into the freeway 's collapse , blaming the disaster on substandard construction , the Associated Press reported .
wsj_1916	3	The impact of the destruction of this 2.5-mile stretch of highway was tragically measured in lost lives .
wsj_1916	4	But there are other long-term effects that raise serious questions about the ability of California 's infrastructure to withstand a major temblor .
wsj_1916	5	It could easily be two years before the well-traveled artery that helps connect Oakland with San Francisco is reopened , and the cost to build a new stretch of highway could soar to more than $ 250 million , said Charles J. O'Connell , deputy district director in Los Angeles of the California Department of Transportation , nicknamed Caltrans .
wsj_1916	6	Caltrans in Sacramento said total damage from the collapsed highway is estimated at around $ 500 million .
wsj_1916	7	The aftershocks of the highway tragedy are reverberating in Los Angeles as well , as local politicians spoke yesterday against plans to bring double-decking to Los Angeles freeways by 1994 .
wsj_1916	8	Caltrans plans to add a second deck for buses and car pools above the median of a 2.5-mile stretch of the Harbor Freeway just south of Los Angeles , near the Memorial Coliseum .
wsj_1916	9	Los Angeles County Supervisor Kenneth Hahn yesterday vowed to fight the introduction of double-decking in the area .
wsj_1916	10	Caltrans abandoned double-decking in the early 1970s , following the 1971 Sylmar earthquake that destroyed freeway sections just north of Los Angeles , Mr. O'Connell explained .
wsj_1916	11	That temblor measured 6.1 on the Richter scale ; Tuesday 's was
wsj_1916	12	So why even consider stacking freeways now ?
wsj_1916	13	`` We 've run out of places to build freeways in L.A. , and the only place to go is up , '' Mr. O'Connell said , although he acknowledges there are many obstacles , including cost .
wsj_1916	14	But as for safety , he says double-deck freeways built today with the heavily reinforced concrete and thicker columns required after the Sylmar quake should withstand a calamitous temblor of 7.5 to 8 on the Richter scale .
wsj_1916	15	Reasons for the collapse of the Nimitz Freeway were sketchy yesterday .
wsj_1916	16	But most structural engineers attributed the destruction to improper reinforcement of the columns that supported the decks , and the fact that the ground beneath the highway is largely landfill and can become unstable , or `` liquefy , '' in a major quake .
wsj_1916	17	The two-story roadway , designed in the mid-1940s and completed in 1957 , was supported by columns that apparently lacked the kind of steel reinforcement used in highways today .
wsj_1916	18	While the pillars did have long metal bars running vertically through them for reinforcement , they apparently lacked an adequate number of metal `` ties '' that run horizontally through the column , said Leo Parker , a structural engineer in Los Angeles .
wsj_1916	19	Caltrans today uses a variation of the design Mr. Parker describes , with spiraling steel rods inside .
wsj_1916	20	But in the case of the Nimitz Freeway , the lack of such support caused the core of the columns to crumble and buckle under the weight of the second deck , crushing motorists who were lined up in bumper-to-bumper rush-hour traffic on the lower deck nearly 15 feet below .
wsj_1916	21	Officials of the state agency did n't have any immediate explanation why the reinforcement did n't hold up .
wsj_1916	22	Caltrans reinforced the highway in 1977 as part of a $ 55 million statewide project , using steel cables to tie the decks of the freeway to the columns and prevent the structure from swaying in a quake .
wsj_1916	23	Caltrans spokesman Jim Drago in Sacramento declined to identify the engineering firm that did the reinforcement work .
wsj_1916	24	Liability in the bridge and road collapses will revolve around whether government took `` reasonable care '' to build and maintain the structures , says John Messina , a Tacoma , Wash. , personal-injury attorney who specializes in highway design and maintenance cases .
wsj_1916	25	The firm brought in to strengthen the structure could be liable as well .
wsj_1916	26	The results of the quake certainly raise questions about whether reasonable care was taken , Mr. Messina says .
wsj_1916	27	Given the seismic history of the Bay Area , `` it seems to me that a 6.9 earthquake is a foreseeable event . ''
wsj_1916	28	Caltrans ' Mr. Drago defended the agency 's work on the Nimitz Freeway .
wsj_1916	29	`` The work was done properly , '' he said .
wsj_1916	30	`` Basically , we had a severe earthquake of significant duration and it was just something the structure could n't withstand . ''
wsj_1916	31	Ironically , Caltrans this year began working on a second round of seismic reinforcements of freeways around the state , this time wrapping freeway columns in `` steel blankets '' to reinforce them .
wsj_1916	32	But only bridges supported with single rows of columns were top priority , and the Nimitz Freeway , supported by double rows , was left out , Mr. Drago explained .
wsj_1916	33	`` The reason is that the technology is such that we 're not able to retrofit multi-column structures , '' he said .

wsj_1917	0	Lionel Corp. 's board unanimously rejected a tender offer of $ 8 a share , or $ 95.4 million , for as much as 90 % of Lionel by a group with a 9.9 % stake in the toy retailer .
wsj_1917	1	Lionel also urged holders of its stock and debt not to tender their securities , saying it wants to remain independent to pursue its business strategy .
wsj_1917	2	Lionel also said the offer by Robert I. Toussie Limited Partnership is inadequate , and full of conditions that leave it `` subject to substantial uncertainty . ''
wsj_1917	3	In addition , Lionel began a lawsuit in federal District Court in New York seeking to enjoin the offer , alleging , among other things , violations of federal securities law and fraudulent manipulation of the market for Lionel 's securities .
wsj_1917	4	Robert I. Toussie , general partner of the investment group , said the Lionel response reflected management 's entrenched position , saying officials had failed to come up with a better alternative to his group 's offer .
wsj_1917	5	Mr. Toussie said he would respond to Lionel 's suit after his lawyers review it .
wsj_1918	0	Efforts by a federal mediator to reignite talks between Boeing Co. and the Machinists union apparently failed , and no further meetings are scheduled .
wsj_1918	1	Company officials and union representatives did n't meet face to face , but the mediator shuttled between the two groups .
wsj_1918	2	In a statement issued after the meeting , the aerospace giant said it wo n't increase its offer although adjustments within the proposed pay-and-benefit mix are possible .
wsj_1918	3	Machinists already have rejected a proposal that called for a 4 % pay increase and 8 % bonus in the first year .

wsj_1918	5	`` The company will not budge on anything , '' said a spokesman for the union .
wsj_1918	6	As the strike enters its 15th day today , some members are getting nervous , the spokesman conceded , but the majority of the 55,000 Machinists are prepared to `` wait it out as long as it takes .
wsj_1919	0	United Merchants & Manufacturers Inc. said its president , Uzi Ruskin , withdrew his proposal to acquire control of the New York textile and clothing company .
wsj_1919	1	Last month , Mr. Ruskin proposed , among other things , to buy 3.5 million shares , or 38 % , for $ 4 apiece .
wsj_1919	2	Coupled with his current 1.2 million shares and 4 % held by an associate , the stake would have given him control of 55 % of the concern .
wsj_1919	3	In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing , Mr. Ruskin had said that holders of the other 45 % of United Merchants would receive one-half share of a new preferred stock for each of their shares .
wsj_1919	4	A special committee of United Merchants directors said that in view of uncertainties regarding various legal and financial considerations , it could n't recommend the plan to the full board .
wsj_1919	5	The company is exploring , with a major financial institution , the development of a plan to boost the value of the company for its holders , Mr. Ruskin said .
wsj_1919	6	In a separate SEC filing , Albert Safer , who holds 6.46 % of United Merchants , said he retained investment bank Lazard Freres & Co. for advice as he evaluates the possibility of making a bid for the textile maker .

wsj_1923	0	Coca-Cola Co. may be about to intensify the cola wars .
wsj_1923	1	Coke said it will test market a caffeine-free version of its flagship brand , Coca-Cola Classic , beginning next week in Charlotte , N.C .
wsj_1923	2	Other , as yet unnamed , cities will follow .
wsj_1923	3	If all goes well , the product will be rolled out for national sales sometime next year , a Coke spokesman said .
wsj_1923	4	After the confusion surrounding the change of the Coke formula in 1985 , Coca-Cola was reluctant to clutter the Classic name with a brand extension .
wsj_1923	5	But now , the soft-drink giant appears willing to take the risk .
wsj_1923	6	`` The name Classic Coke has tremendous value , and they have n't merchandised that name before , '' says Jesse Meyers , publisher of the trade journal Beverage Digest .
wsj_1923	7	The Coke spokesman said a caffeine-free Classic should help increase volume of the original brand .
wsj_1923	8	Indeed , analysts have said that the absence of new products , among other factors , has limited sales growth throughout the industry .
wsj_1923	9	Coke now leads Pepsi in market share in caffeine-free diet colas but trails Pepsi in sales of caffeine-free sugared colas , according to Beverage Digest .
wsj_1923	10	Coke introduced a caffeine-free sugared cola based on its original formula in 1983 .
wsj_1923	11	It switched to a caffeine-free formula using its new Coke in 1985 .
wsj_1923	12	Coke has been studying the possibility of introducing a caffeine-free Classic for a year , a company spokesman said .
wsj_1923	13	He said large increases in sales of other non-caffeine soft drinks make the timing right now .

wsj_1924	35	Most of the country 's 20,000 judges and judicial employees joined the work stoppage .
wsj_1925	0	Charles S. Mitchell , a vice president with Homart Development Co. , the real estate development subsidiary of Sears , Roebuck & Co. , was named president of Figgie Properties , a real estate development unit .
wsj_1925	1	He succeeds William Kohut , who resigned earlier this year .
wsj_1925	2	Also , Richard A. Barkley , a former marketing executive with FMC Corp. , was appointed president of Continental Container Systems , a producer of can closing machinery that Figgie acquired late last year .
wsj_1925	3	Figgie is a fire protection , electronics and industrial products concern .
wsj_1926	0	Dow Chemical Co. said third-quarter net income slipped 6.8 % from a record year-ago quarter .
wsj_1926	1	The decline broke a streak of 10 quarters in which Dow posted earnings increases .
wsj_1926	2	Dow 's third-quarter net fell to $ 589 million , or $ 3.29 a share , from $ 632 million , or $ 3.36 a share , a year ago .
wsj_1926	3	Sales in the latest quarter rose 2 % to $ 4.25 billion from $ 4.15 billion a year earlier .
wsj_1926	4	Dow closed at $ 94.625 a share , up 75 cents , in New York Stock Exchange composite trading .
wsj_1926	5	A spokeswoman said Dow is comfortable with Wall Street expectations that full-year earnings will total about $ 14.60 a share , compared with last year 's record net of $ 2.4 billion , or $ 12.76 a share .
wsj_1926	6	But that signal on full-year profit casts doubt on whether Dow will improve on its year-ago fourth-quarter net of $ 3.44 a share , or $ 635 million .
wsj_1926	7	Dow would earn $ 14.85 a share for the year if it equaled that year-ago fourth-quarter performance .
wsj_1926	8	Dow officials were signaling that the company would earn less than $ 15 a share this year even before they announced in July a plan to acquire 67 % of Marion Laboratories Inc .
wsj_1926	9	That acquisition could further dilute earnings per share this year , the company spokeswoman said .
wsj_1926	10	Dow has n't said exactly what impact the Marion acquisition will have on 1989 earnings .
wsj_1926	11	Dow blamed the third-quarter earnings drop on several factors , including softer prices for polyethylene and other basic chemicals , a slower U.S. economy and a stronger dollar , which made Dow 's exports from the U.S. more expensive to overseas customers .
wsj_1926	12	Another problem was a 7 % increase in operating costs at a time when revenue was rising by only 2 % .
wsj_1926	13	For the first nine months of the year , Dow earned $ 2.06 billion , or $ 11.41 a share , up 17 % from $ 1.76 billion , or $ 9.32 a share , a year ago .
wsj_1926	14	Sales for the latest nine months rose 7.7 % to $ 13.34 billion from $ 12.38 billion in the year-ago period .
wsj_1931	0	The dollar finished softer yesterday , tilted lower by continued concern about the stock market .
wsj_1931	1	`` We 're trading with a very wary eye on Wall Street , '' said Trevor Woodland , chief corporate trader at Harris Trust & Savings Bank in New York .
wsj_1931	2	`` No one is willing to place a firm bet that the stock market wo n't take another tumultuous ride . ''
wsj_1931	3	News of the major earthquake in California Tuesday triggered a round of dollar sales in early Asian trade , but most foreign-exchange dealers said they expect the impact of the quake on financial markets to be short-lived .
wsj_1931	4	Despite the dollar 's lackluster performance , some foreign-exchange traders maintain that the U.S. unit remains relatively well bid .
wsj_1931	5	Harris Trust 's Mr. Woodland noted that the unit continues to show resilience in the face of a barrage of `` headline negatives '' in recent weeks , including rate increases in Europe and Japan , aggressive central bank intervention , a 190-point plunge in New York stock prices , an unexpectedly poor U.S. trade report and action by the Federal Reserve to nudge U.S. rates lower .
wsj_1931	6	While Mr. Woodland does n't predict a significant climb for the U.S. unit in light of recent moves in interest rates around the world , he noted that `` its downside potential is surprisingly and -- for dollar bulls -- `` impressively '' limited .
wsj_1931	7	In late New York trading yesterday , the dollar was quoted at 1.8485 marks , down from 1.8667 marks late Tuesday , and at 141.45 yen , down from 142.75 yen late Tuesday .
wsj_1931	8	Sterling was quoted at $ 1.5920 , up from $ 1.5753 late Tuesday .
wsj_1931	9	In Tokyo Thursday , the U.S. currency opened for trading at 140.97 yen , down from Wednesday 's Tokyo close of 142.10 yen .
wsj_1931	10	Since Friday 's dive in stock market prices , the Fed has injected reserves into the banking system in an effort to calm the markets and avert a repeat of 1987 's stock market debacle .
wsj_1931	11	Some analysts note that after last week 's stock market tailspin and Tuesday 's California earthquake , it 's hard to gauge where the central bank wants the key federal funds rate .
wsj_1931	12	They say that the earthquake , by preventing many banks from operating at full capacity , has given the Fed an additional reason to keep liquidity at a high level .
wsj_1931	13	The Fed did , in fact , execute $ 1.5 billion of liquidity-enhancing customer repurchase agreements , the third set of repurchase orders in three days .
wsj_1931	14	Analysts said the additional liquidity should tend to reduce the federal funds rate .
wsj_1931	15	For now , traders say the foreign exchange market is scrutinizing both federal funds and events on Wall Street .
wsj_1931	16	They note that the dollar remains extremely vulnerable to the slightest bad news from the stock exchange .
wsj_1931	17	Indeed , the U.S. unit edged lower as the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped about 13 points in early trading .
wsj_1931	18	A slight recovery in the stock market gave currency traders confidence to push the dollar higher before the unit dropped back by day 's end .
wsj_1931	19	Some dealers noted that nervousness over the recent sharp dive in stock prices could intensify following suggestions by Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita that appeared to advise Japanese investors to be very careful in investing in U.S. leveraged buy-outs .
wsj_1931	20	Dealers suggest that the only positive news on the horizon that could detract attention from equities transactions is September 's U.S. consumer price data .
wsj_1931	21	The figures , due for release Friday , are expected to show an uptick in inflation to 4.8 % from 4.7 % in August .
wsj_1931	22	If the figures show a hefty rise in inflation , they could militate against easing by the Fed .
wsj_1931	23	On the Commodity Exchange in New York , gold for current delivery rose $ 1.30 to $ 368.70 an ounce in moderate trading .

wsj_1931	25	In early trading in Hong Kong Thursday , gold was at $ 368.15 an ounce .

wsj_1934	0	A new drug to prevent the rejection of transplanted organs has been successfully used on more than 100 patients at the University of Pittsburgh , according to researchers .
wsj_1934	1	The drug , which is still in the experimental phase , has n't been approved yet by the Food and Drug Admistration , and its long-term effects are unknown .
wsj_1934	2	But researchers say the drug , called FK-506 , could revolutionize the transplantation field by reducing harmful side effects and by lowering rejection rates .
wsj_1934	3	Rejection has been the major obstacle in the approximately 30,000 organ transplants performed world-wide each year .
wsj_1934	4	Researchers began using the drug in February on patients who had received kidney , liver , heart and pancreas transplants .
wsj_1934	5	Only two of 111 transplants have been rejected .
wsj_1934	6	The drug , discovered in 1984 , is metabolized from soil fungus found in Japan .
wsj_1934	7	The Pittsburgh patients are the first humans to be given the drug , which is made by Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co .
wsj_1934	8	`` We 're shocked by it , because it 's worked so fast , '' said Dr. Thomas E. Starzl , director of the University of Pittsburgh Transplantation Program , at a news conference here yesterday .
wsj_1934	9	`` We consider it a life-saving drug , like one for AIDS , '' said Dr. John Fung , an immunologist at the University of Pittsburgh .
wsj_1934	10	Researchers say they believe FK-506 is 100 times more effective than the traditional anti-rejection drug , cyclosporine , made by Swiss pharmaceutical giant Sandoz Ltd .
wsj_1934	11	They are also encouraged by the relatively mild side effects of FK-506 , compared with cyclosporine , which can cause renal failure , morbidity , nausea and other problems .
wsj_1934	12	`` The side effects of cyclosporine have made the penalty for its success rather high , '' Dr. Starzl said .
wsj_1934	13	Dr. Fung said that FK-506 would not be available in the market for at least a year , and that the FDA approval process usually takes three years to five years .
wsj_1934	14	There are no firm plans to expand the experimental program beyond the University of Pittsburgh , whose hospital performs the most transplants in the world .
wsj_1934	15	Researchers could n't estimate the cost of the drug when it reaches the market , but they said FK-506 will enable patients to cut hospital stays by 50 % and reduce the number of blood tests used to monitor the dosage of cyclosporine and other drugs among transplant recipients .
wsj_1934	16	Dr. Starzl said the research has been largely financed by the National Institute of Health and by university funds , and that Fujisawa did n't give the hospital any grants .
wsj_1934	17	He said that the research team had no financial stake in the drug .
wsj_1934	18	`` We 've known for six months the effect of this drug , and our advice to our people has been not to buy the company 's stock , '' Dr. Starzl said , adding that profiting from FK-506 would n't be ethical .
wsj_1936	0	This seems to be the season for revivals in Chicago .
wsj_1936	1	Though the Cubs ' championship season ended with the National League playoffs , a revival of the Organic Theater 's production of `` Bleacher Bums , '' a play in nine innings set in the Wrigley Field bleachers , continues within spitting distance of the ballpark .
wsj_1936	2	Revivals of a different sort also are being offered by our two major theater troupes , the Goodman and Steppenwolf .
wsj_1936	3	Each is more problematic than an unexpected divisional baseball championship , but both help explain why Chicago remains a vital center of this country 's regional theater movement .
wsj_1936	4	The Goodman is offering a modernized version of Moliere 's `` The Misanthrope '' through Nov. 4 .
wsj_1936	5	The original is a comedy about Alceste , a man who sees falseness and vanity in everyone except himself .
wsj_1936	6	He is the jealous friend of Philinte , and the jealous lover of Celimene .
wsj_1936	7	The play is filled with intrigue , dishonesty and injustice .
wsj_1936	8	Twenty-five years ago the poet Richard Wilbur modernized this 17th-century comedy merely by avoiding `` the zounds sort of thing , '' as he wrote in his introduction .
wsj_1936	9	Otherwise , the scene remained Celimene 's house in 1666 .
wsj_1936	10	Assuming modern audiences readily understand that Moliere 's social indictment covers their world as well as 17th-century Paris , Mr. Wilbur concentrated his formidable artistry on rendering the Alexandrine French verse into sprightly and theatrical English iambic pentameter .
wsj_1936	11	The Wilbur translation is remarkable -- well worth a read and even better seen in the theater if you ever have the opportunity .
wsj_1936	12	But if you happen to be coming to Chicago in the next few weeks , do n't fail to have a look at Robert Falls 's `` The Misanthrope '' at the Goodman .
wsj_1936	13	If Mr. Wilbur 's translation is a finely ground lens through which we see the pettiness and corruption of 17th-century Paris , Mr. Falls 's production is a mirror in which we see ourselves .
wsj_1936	14	Mr. Falls , the Goodman 's artistic director , took a recent adaptation by Neil Bartlett and significantly adapted it .
wsj_1936	15	Mr. Bartlett had slimmed Moliere 's cast of characters to six and set them in the London media world of Thatcherite Britain .
wsj_1936	16	Mr. Falls transfers the setting to Hollywood , and transforms the characters into what passes for aristocracy there -- agents , producers , actors , writers and sycophants .
wsj_1936	17	Mr. Bartlett managed to more or less maintain Moliere 's Alexandrine verse form , 12 syllable lines in rhyming couplets .
wsj_1936	18	Mr. Falls kept the form , but Americanized it with Mr. Bartlett 's further help .
wsj_1936	19	With a splendid cast led by David Darlow as Alceste , Christina Haag as Celimene and , especially , William Brown as a Philinte who plays the Hollywood game but harbors authentic values and feelings , the Goodman production barrels through an all-night Hollywood party with exuberance and wit .
wsj_1936	20	If this version , with its references to Steven Spielberg , Spago and `` thirtysomething '' attracts younger audiences who might stay away from the classical version , then Messrs. Bartlett and Falls are justified in abandoning Mr. Wilbur .
wsj_1936	21	A 300-year-old play may be easier to revive than one merely 25 .
wsj_1936	22	The Steppenwolf Theatre Company , back from a critical and box office success in London with its adaptation of Steinbeck 's `` The Grapes of Wrath , '' opened the new season with Harold Pinter 's `` The Homecoming , '' first produced by the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1965 .
wsj_1936	23	Back then , Mr. Pinter was not only the angry young British playwright , but also the first to use silences and sentence fragments and menacing stares , almost to the exclusion of what we previously understood to be theatrical dialogue .
wsj_1936	24	When `` The Homecoming '' was first produced on this side of the Atlantic , actors and directors were reverential .
wsj_1936	25	Silences were lengthy -- nobody moved or gestured .
wsj_1936	26	Nobody smiled onstage , and nobody in the audience was encouraged to laugh .
wsj_1936	27	This kind of theater was new to us .
wsj_1936	28	Also , it was not a funny time over here , what with the Vietnam War , the '68 Democratic convention , assassinations and riots .
wsj_1936	29	But under Jerry Perry 's direction the current Steppenwolf production , scheduled to play through Nov. 19 , breaks through the flat and boring ritual that `` The Homecoming '' had become .
wsj_1936	30	Led by a near-perfect performance by Alan Wilder as Max , the father , the play is at once an appalling and hilarious dissection of a family 's rage , bitterness , fear and isolation .
wsj_1936	31	Encouraged by Mr. Wilder 's sly grins , embarrassed grimaces and sputtering rages , the audience gets the joke and begins to laugh before the end of the first act .
wsj_1936	32	Three of the family members , Max and his two sons , Lenny and Joey , live off the flesh : Max is a retired butcher , Lenny a pimp and Joey an aspiring boxer .
wsj_1936	33	Sam , Max 's brother , has escaped the flesh by working as a liveried chauffeur and never seeking a wife .
wsj_1936	34	Teddy , the eldest of Max 's sons , has made the most dramatic escape by becoming a professor of philosophy at an American university .
wsj_1936	35	Though it 's clearly Max 's wife who held sway here until her death , now none of the other male residents of this misbegotten household can challenge Max .
wsj_1936	36	The play concerns Teddy 's homecoming with his wife of six years , Ruth .
wsj_1936	37	Curiously , Randall Arney as Teddy seems the only cast member unable to get beyond the zombie approach to a Pinter character .
wsj_1936	38	As Ruth , Moira Harris , a large and beautiful woman who may be our next Colleen Dewhurst , begins almost immediately to overpower each of the men .
wsj_1936	39	In the end , Teddy returns alone to America , leaving Ruth in Max 's chair .
wsj_1936	40	We have seen her develop within a few hours from a shy and unknown in-law to a goddess of the flesh who will replace the dead mother , and then some .
wsj_1936	41	While Steppenwolf was in London with `` The Grapes of Wrath , '' Bruce Sagan , the president of its board of directors , quietly returned to Chicago to buy a piece of real estate in the city 's rapidly reviving North Halsted Street restaurant and theater district .
wsj_1936	42	Within a year he hopes Steppenwolf will move into a new 500-seat theater on that site .
wsj_1936	43	The troupe currently performs in a converted dairy that seats 211 and provides little capacity for staging anything beyond a simple one-set production .
wsj_1936	44	`` If we wanted to stage ` Death of a Salesman , ' `` Mr. Sagan says , `` Willie Loman would have to live in a ranch house because of the low ceiling . ''
wsj_1936	45	Steppenwolf needs the extra seats even more than the fly space .
wsj_1936	46	It 's currently forced to turn away many potential subscribers beyond the 13,000 who can be accommodated in its present digs .
wsj_1936	47	For all the attention that Chicago theater has received during the past decade , not one new building has been devoted to it .
wsj_1936	48	Mr. Sagan , a former publisher and real estate developer , has put together an $ 8 million financial package that includes approximately $ 4 million of tax exempt bonds issued by the State of Illinois the first time that a state has used its educational facilities authority to support construction of a theater , and approximately $ 1 million in grants from the National Endowment for the Arts , the MacArthur Foundation , and a few other deep pockets .
wsj_1936	49	The rest , he is confident , can be raised .
wsj_1936	50	His board members alone have pledged $ 800,000 and he is just beginning to massage local foundations and corporations .
wsj_1936	51	Mr. Sagan compares the importance of Steppenwolf with Orson Welles 's Mercury Theater in the '30s .
wsj_1936	52	But Welles 's theater company turned out to have a brief -- one might say a mercurial -- existence .
wsj_1936	53	do with his new theater building if the allure of Hollywood and Broadway proves too much for such Steppenwolf stalwarts as John Malkovich `` Dangerous Liaisons '' ) , Joan Allen `` The Heidi Chronicles '' ) , and Glenne Headly `` Lonesome Dove '' ) , and the company crumbles ?
wsj_1936	54	`` That 's OK , '' Mr. Sagan replies .
wsj_1936	55	`` Let this building be Steppenwolf 's legacy to Chicago theater . ''
wsj_1936	56	Mr. Henning is a Chicago-based law firm management consultant and a writer .
wsj_1938	0	Ciba-Geigy Ltd. and Chiron Corp. said they extended their offer for Connaught BioSciences Inc. , valued at 866 million Canadian dollars US$ 736 million to Oct. 27 .
wsj_1938	1	The companies earlier said they did n't want to raise their offer to match a rival bid by Institut Merieux S.A. of C$ 37 a share , or C$ 942 million .
wsj_1938	2	But they said the C$ 30-a-share bid , which was due to expire Monday , may still be extended or varied .
wsj_1938	3	Merieux , a vaccine manufacturer based in Lyon , France , is 51%-held by French state-owned Rhone-Poulenc S.A .
wsj_1938	4	Ciba-Geigy is a major pharmaceutical concern based in Basel , Switzerland .
wsj_1938	5	Chiron , another pharmaceutical concern , is based in Emeryville , Calif .
wsj_1938	6	Connaught is a biotechnology research and vaccine manufacturing concern .
wsj_1938	7	Institut Merieux 's bid for Toronto-based Connaught has run into problems with the Canadian government , which told Merieux last week that it was n't convinced that the proposed acquisition would be of `` net benefit '' to Canada .
wsj_1938	8	Merieux officials are expected to meet with federal officials in Ottawa today to discuss the decision .
wsj_1940	0	Federal prosecutors said they have obtained a guilty plea from another person in the government 's ongoing probe of illegal payments in the record industry .
wsj_1940	1	William Craig , an independent record promoter , pleaded guilty to payola and criminal tax charges , according to a statement issued by Gary Feess , the U.S. attorney here .
wsj_1940	2	Payola is the practice of making illegal , undisclosed payments to radio station personnel in return for getting the stations to play certain songs over the air .
wsj_1940	3	As part of his plea agreement with the government , the 44-year-old Mr. Craig faces a maximum of three years in prison .
wsj_1940	4	In return , Mr. Craig agreed to cooperate in the government 's continuing payola probe , says a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney 's office .
wsj_1940	5	Mr. Craig and three others were indicted last year as part of that payola probe .
wsj_1940	6	Two other defendants previously pleaded guilty , and charges against the third were dropped .
wsj_1941	0	Companies listed below reported quarterly profit substantially different from the average of analysts ' estimates .
wsj_1941	1	The companies are followed by at least three analysts , and had a minimum five-cent change in actual earnings per share .
wsj_1941	2	Estimated and actual results involving losses are omitted .
wsj_1941	3	The percent difference compares actual profit with the 30-day estimate where at least three analysts have issues forecasts in the past 30 days .

wsj_1943	0	The Tennessee Valley Authority issued $ 4 billion in bonds in the federal utility 's first public debt offering in 15 years .
wsj_1943	1	Proceeds from the bonds , with coupon rates in the 8 % range , will be used to replace bonds with an average interest rate of 13.1 % .
wsj_1943	2	The TVA said the refinancing should save $ 75 million a year in interest payments .
wsj_1943	3	The refinancing is part of the TVA 's strategy of dealing with what has been an intractable problem : its staggering $ 18.5 billion debt , most of which is owed to the Treasury Department 's Federal Financing Bank .
wsj_1943	4	The TVA currently plans to issue a total of $ 6.7 billion in bonds to refinance its high-interest debt .
wsj_1943	5	The $ 4 billion bond issue also will help the TVA meet its goal of not raising rates for another year , said William F. Malec , the agency 's chief financial officer .
wsj_1943	6	The bond issue is TVA 's first public offering since the Financing Bank was created in 1974 , primarily to finance the TVA .
wsj_1943	7	But the offering almost did n't happen .
wsj_1943	8	The TVA , in fact , decided to proceed with the bond offering following an agreement last week with the Financing Bank , which allows TVA to keep borrowing short term from the bank for two years after it goes to the public market .
wsj_1943	9	The Treasury contended that TVA could n't borrow from both it and the public debt market .
wsj_1943	10	The $ 4 billion in bonds break down as follows : $ 1 billion in five-year bonds with a coupon rate of 8.25 % and a yield to maturity of 8.33 % ; $ 1 billion in 10-year bonds with a coupon rate of 8.375 % and a yield to maturity of 8.42 % ; $ 2 billion in 30-year bonds with five-year call protection , a coupon rate of 8.75 % and a yield to maturity of 9.06 % .
wsj_1943	11	Managing the bond issue is a group of investment banks headed by First Boston Corp. and co-managed by Goldman , Sachs & Co. , Merrill Lynch Capital Markets , Morgan Stanley & Co. , and Salomon Brothers Inc .
wsj_1944	0	Mutual-fund czar John M. Templeton has put his money where his moniker is , pouring $ 1.4 million into one of his own funds , the Templeton Value Fund .
wsj_1944	1	Mr. Templeton owns shares in several of the 33 funds that his firm manages , but only in three of the 10 available to U.S. investors , according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission .
wsj_1944	2	Those are Templeton Global Income , Templeton Emerging Markets and now the Value Fund .
wsj_1944	3	Why did he add the Value Fund to the list ?
wsj_1944	4	Because he 's very bullish on the emerging growth stocks that make up the fund 's portfolio , Mr. Templeton said from his Bahamas hideaway .
wsj_1944	5	`` Emerging growth stocks have n't been popular in America for years , they 've been neglected , '' he said , and their prices often trail the market as a whole .
wsj_1944	6	Mr. Templeton 's 147,300-share purchase in the closed-end fund came before the U.S. stock market 's plunge last Friday , but still proved slightly profitable .
wsj_1944	7	Mr. Templeton bought his shares in several separate purchases between Aug. 30 and Sept. 28 , according to reports with the SEC .
wsj_1944	8	He bought at share prices ranging from $ 9.375 to $ 9.625 .
wsj_1944	9	The fund closed yesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading at $ 9.625 , up 12.5 cents .
wsj_1944	10	In addition , Mr. Templeton received a dividend of 22 cents a share Oct. 5 .
wsj_1944	11	A senior vice president and a vice president at James River Corp. sold the majority of their shares in the Richmond , Va. , paper-products concern in late August and early September , reports filed with the SEC show .
wsj_1944	12	The executives , who got $ 30.88 a share for the stock , showed good timing .
wsj_1944	13	In Big Board trading yesterday , James River shares closed at $ 28.375 , down 12.5 cents .
wsj_1944	14	On Sept. 6 , Robert Joseph Sherry , the firm 's senior vice president of employee and public relations , sold 4,000 shares , leaving himself with 1,062 shares of James River .
wsj_1944	15	Including a sale of stock last February , Mr. Sherry has sold 88 % of his stake in the company this year , according to SEC filings .
wsj_1944	16	Mr. Sherry declined to comment when asked about the sales .
wsj_1944	17	James A. Toney , a vice president , sold 1,500 shares Aug. 28 .
wsj_1944	18	He still has 1,143 shares , according to SEC files .
wsj_1944	19	Mr. Toney also declined to comment .
wsj_1944	20	Cincinnati Gas & Electric Co. tops the companies portion of the accompanying Insider Trading table this week .
wsj_1944	21	Three of the utility 's directors have at least doubled their holdings in the company since July .
wsj_1944	22	The largest purchase was by Dudley Taft , who bought 4,400 shares for $ 125,075 .
wsj_1944	23	Mr. Taft , who is also president of Taft Broadcasting Co. , said he bought the shares because he keeps a utility account at the brokerage firm of Salomon Brothers Inc. , which had recommended the stock as a good buy .
wsj_1944	24	Salomon Brothers confirmed that it has had a buy recommendation on the stock for about two years .
wsj_1944	25	`` Cincinnati Gas & Electric is in good shape , '' Mr. Taft said , and utilities are `` a good investment because interest rates are going down . ''
wsj_1944	26	Mr. Taft paid an average of $ 28.43 for each share .
wsj_1944	27	The stock closed yesterday on the Big Board at $ 28.75 , down 12.5 cents .
wsj_1944	28	The two other directors bought 1,000 and 1,900 shares , respectively , at prices between $ 28.15 a share and $ 28.75 a share , filings with the SEC show .
wsj_1944	29	The two could n't be reached for comment .
wsj_1944	30	A company spokesman said he could n't explain their sudden bullishness .
wsj_1944	31	`` I do n't know of any news or anything unusual happening here , '' said Bruce Stoecklin , director of media services .

wsj_1945	0	T. Rowe Price Associates Inc. said directors recommended stockholders approve a 2-for-1 stock split and an increase in authorized shares to 25 million from 10 million .
wsj_1945	1	Stockholders will vote on the proposal at a meeting Dec. 13 .
wsj_1945	2	T. Rowe Price is an investment adviser to mutual funds , institutions and individuals .
wsj_1948	0	Times may be tough on Wall Street for some , but a few bosses are making as much as ever -- or more .
wsj_1948	1	At Bear Stearns Cos. , for example , the 15 executive officers led by Chairman Alan `` Ace '' Greenberg got a pay increase to $ 35.9 million for the 14-month period ended June 30 from $ 22.9 million for the 12 months ended April 30 , 1988 .
wsj_1948	2	The figures do n't include substantial dividends on holdings of Bear Stearns stock .
wsj_1948	3	Mr. Greenberg himself was paid $ 4.5 million , before an estimated $ 1.5 million in dividends , up from $ 2.4 million the year before .
wsj_1948	4	The increase is noted in the brokerage firm 's latest proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission .
wsj_1948	5	Because it operates on a fiscal year , Bear Stearns 's yearly filings are available much earlier than those of other firms .
wsj_1948	6	The latest period includes 14 months instead of 12 because Bear Stearns changed to a fiscal year ending in June instead of April .
wsj_1948	7	Meanwhile , Bear Stearns 's 650 stock and bond salesmen saw thinner paychecks over the past year , which the company says reflected lower commission revenue caused by a decline in investor activity in the markets .
wsj_1948	8	However , Bear Stearns on Monday reported improved earnings for its first quarter , ended Sept. 29 , partly because of a 31 % increase in commissions during the quarter .
wsj_1948	9	William J. Montgoris , chief financial officer , defended the lofty salaries at Bear Stearns .
wsj_1948	10	`` All of us are on a base salary of $ 200,000 if the firm makes nothing -- and that 's pretty low as far as Wall Street goes , '' Mr. Montgoris said .
wsj_1948	11	However , Bear Stearns has never had an unprofitable year since its founding 65 years ago .
wsj_1948	12	Four Bear Stearns executives besides the 62-year-old Mr. Greenberg were paid $ 3 million or more before dividends for the 14 months ended in June .
wsj_1948	13	According to the proxy statement , James E. Cayne , 55 , Bear Stearns 's president , made $ 3.9 million ; an executive vice president , Michael L. Tarnopol , 53 , made nearly $ 3.4 million ; and two executive vice presidents , Vincent J. Mattone , 44 , and William J. Michaelcheck , 42 , made about $ 3.3 million each .
wsj_1948	14	Mr. Montgoris said the firm has a `` straight mathematical formula '' for determining compensation , based on the firm 's earnings .
wsj_1948	15	`` Just because a particular element of the firm is down , '' such as stockbrokerage , `` does n't mean the executive committee should be paid less , '' he said .

wsj_1952	0	Just after midnight Monday , federal spending started to drop by $ 16 billion .
wsj_1952	1	What do you say we all close down the poker game , go home and bank the $ 16 billion ?
wsj_1952	2	That 's essentially what budget director Richard Darman is suggesting , and we think he deserves as much support as he can get .
wsj_1952	3	If human beings ca n't cut federal spending honestly -- and they ca n't -- let the computers do it .
wsj_1952	4	Congress , with a measure of White House complicity , has been manipulating the spending accounts for years under the cover of omnibus appropriations bills .
wsj_1952	5	Indeed without earlier manipulations , the current sequester of $ 16 billion would have been even larger .
wsj_1952	6	We suspect voters are fed up with the finagling .
wsj_1952	7	Consider , for instance , that even yesterday 's widely publicized sequester is likely to be traduced if business as usual is allowed to prevail .
wsj_1952	8	Under the law , Gramm-Rudman 's across-the-board-cuts in federal programs are supposed to be permanent .
wsj_1952	9	Social Security and spending for poor people are exempted .
wsj_1952	10	However , the Associated Press 's account of the Monday sequester order signed by President Bush neatly captured the contempt Congress shows toward the notion of a legally binding commitment :
wsj_1952	11	`` Lawmakers have been saying for weeks that they plan to roll back the cuts as soon as they agree to a compromise on a deficit-cutting bill . ''
wsj_1952	12	Mr. Darman 's inclination to save the sequester was backed up yesterday by White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater :
wsj_1952	13	`` There is some feeling here that the cuts are the way to go .
wsj_1952	14	It will reduce spending in a very effective fashion . ''
wsj_1952	15	This attitude is being waved away by sophisticates around Washington as little more than tough talk .
wsj_1952	16	It looks to us like a golden opportunity for George Bush to chop off at the knees all this talk about a timid , unserious presidency .
wsj_1952	17	Mr. Bush would be acting in the public interest if he let the Washington elites who manipulate these budgets -- the bureaucrats , the lobbyists , the congressional staffers -- live for just one year on a restricted diet .
wsj_1952	18	Ask Tommy Lasorda ; thin is in .
wsj_1952	19	Senator Phil Gramm pointed out Monday that in the 20 years before Gramm-Rudman was enacted in 1985 , federal spending grew by about 11 % a year ; since the law , it 's grown at under 5 % annually .
wsj_1952	20	Another major factor in this positive trend was Ronald Reagan 's decision early in his presidency to fight the budget war on the expenditure side rather than raising taxes .
wsj_1952	21	George Bush 's continued support of the tax dam sustains this strategy of pressuring Congress to make choices among competing priorities , rather than just saying yes to all the grateful special-interest constituencies that fill the PAC trough .
wsj_1952	22	If Washington 's elites ever succeed in bursting the tax dam , Americans will be engulfed in a red sea of new spending programs , such as federalized child care .
wsj_1952	23	Child care was one of the many `` extraneous '' bills pulled out of the Senate 's reconciliation bill last Friday .
wsj_1952	24	Others were the capital-gains cut , Section 89 repeal , the disabled workers bill , and the unprecedented reconsideration of the catastrophic health act .
wsj_1952	25	All this stuff still is in the House 's 1,878-page reconciliation bill , and many Members say they 're reluctant to pull out cherished bills , just to see them die .
wsj_1952	26	Republicans especially want a guarantee from the House leadership that they 'll get an up-or-down vote on the bills .
wsj_1952	27	House Speaker Foley ought to deliver that promise .
wsj_1952	28	This is the way government is supposed to work , with politicians taking responsibility for votes that their constituents can identify , instead of concealing them in the great reconciliation garbage truck .
wsj_1952	29	We have as much nostalgia as anyone for those leafy , breezy days in Washington when honorable men and women dickered over budgets and even log-rolled a bit to see that the bridges got build , roads paved , soldiers paid or that the desperately poor were cared for .
wsj_1952	30	Those days are gone .
wsj_1952	31	Nor do we see any reason to believe that a metropolitan Washington that has gotten fat and rich and lazy in the shadow of the federal colossus will change much on its own initiative .
wsj_1952	32	Save the sequester , and let Washington scream .
wsj_1953	0	The New York Stock Exchange said a seat sold for $ 436,000 , down $ 39,000 from the previous sale Oct. 4 .
wsj_1953	1	Seats are currently quoted at $ 425,000 bid and $ 475,000 offered .
wsj_1953	2	The $ 475,000 sale price earlier this month was the lowest in nearly three years .

wsj_1954	0	The Canadian government auctioned 750 million Canadian dollars US$ 637.5 million of 9.25 % bonds due Dec. 15 , 1994 .

wsj_1954	2	Proceeds of the sale will be used to redeem C$ 675 million of government bonds maturing Nov. 1 and for general government purposes .
wsj_1955	0	Northern Trust Corp. said its board adopted a shareholder rights plan aimed at deterring unwanted takeover bids , but said it 's not aware of any plan to acquire the banking concern .
wsj_1955	1	Under Northern Trust 's plan , shareholders were issued rights that , in the event of certain attempted takeovers , allow holders to buy shares in the company at half price .
wsj_1956	0	National Patent Development Corp. said it plans to purchase as many as 200,000 common shares of its 81%-controlled Interferon Sciences Inc. unit in periodic , open-market purchases .

wsj_1956	2	Noting the recent Food and Drug Administration approval of Interferon 's genital warts treatment , National Patent said it believes Interferon 's stock is undervalued .
wsj_1958	0	Zurn Industries Inc. said it received approval to proceed on four separate projects with a total contract value of $ 59 million .

wsj_1959	0	AVX Corp. and Unitrode Corp. said they completed the previously reported sale of Unitrode 's San Diego-based Passive Components division to AVX .

wsj_1959	2	Passive Components makes capacitors and filters used to protect electronics .
wsj_1960	0	Consolidated Papers Inc. said it plans to spend $ 495 million on new paper-manufacturing equipment and facilities .
wsj_1960	1	The producer of paper used in magazines and by commercial printers said spending on the expansion is planned to begin in the first quarter of 1990 .
wsj_1960	2	The expansion is subject to approval by federal and Wisconsin environmental regulators .
wsj_1961	0	THE STOCK of Applied Power Inc. , which split 2-for-1 in May , has risen since August 1988 .
wsj_1961	1	In yesterday 's edition , it was incorrectly stated that the company 's share price has softened since August 1988 .
wsj_1962	0	The stock market 's dizzying gyrations during the past few days have made a lot of individual investors wish they could buy some sort of insurance .
wsj_1962	1	After all , they wo n't soon forget the stock bargains that became available after the October 1987 crash .
wsj_1962	2	But while they want to be on the alert for similar buying opportunities now , they 're afraid of being hammered by another terrifying plunge .
wsj_1962	3	The solution , at least for some investors , may be a hedging technique that 's well known to players in the stock-options market .
wsj_1962	4	Called a `` married put , '' the technique is carried out by purchasing a stock and simultaneously buying a put option on that stock .
wsj_1962	5	It 's like `` fire insurance , '' says Harrison Roth , the senior options strategist at Cowen & Co .
wsj_1962	6	Because a put option gives its owner the right , but not the obligation , to sell a fixed number of shares of the stock at a stated price on or before the option 's expiration date , the investor is protected against a sudden drop in the stock 's price .
wsj_1962	7	But most investment advisers do n't recommend using married puts all the time .
wsj_1962	8	That 's because the cost of buying put options eats into an investor 's profit when stock prices rise .
wsj_1962	9	`` This is the type of fire insurance you only buy when the nearby woods are on fire , '' says Mr. Roth .
wsj_1962	10	`` You always want your house insured , but you do n't always feel the need for your investments to be insured . ''
wsj_1962	11	In addition to hedging new stock purchases , the married-put technique can be used to protect stocks that an investor already owns .
wsj_1962	12	In either case , the investor faces three possible outcomes :
wsj_1962	13	-- If the stock goes up in price between now and the put 's expiration date , the put will probably expire worthless .
wsj_1962	14	The investor will be out the cost of the put , which is called the `` premium , '' and this loss will reduce the stock-market profit .
wsj_1962	15	-- If the stock stays at the same price between now and the put 's expiration date , the investor 's loss will be limited to the cost of the put , less any amount realized from a closing sale of the put .
wsj_1962	16	The worst-case scenario would be if the put expires worthless .
wsj_1962	17	-- If the price of the stock declines , the put will increase in value .
wsj_1962	18	Once the stock price is less than the exercise price , or `` strike price , '' of the put , the gain will match the loss on the stock dollar for dollar .
wsj_1962	19	The put establishes a minimum selling price for the stock during its life .
wsj_1962	20	When a stock falls below the put 's strike price , the investor simply sells the stock at a loss and simultaneously sells the put at a profit .
wsj_1962	21	Or , the investor can exercise the put , by tendering the stock to his or her broker in return for payment from another investor who has sold a put on the same stock .
wsj_1962	22	Brokers handle such transactions through the Options Clearing Corp. , which guarantees all option trades .
wsj_1962	23	The accompanying table shows how this strategy would work for three stocks .
wsj_1962	24	Though not reflected in the table , an investor should know that the cost of the option insurance can be partially offset by any dividends that the stock pays .
wsj_1962	25	For example , Tenneco Inc. pays a quarterly dividend of 76 cents , which would be received before the February option expires and , thus , reduce the cost of using the technique by that amount .
wsj_1962	26	In this case , the investor 's risk would n't exceed 3.6 % of the total investment .
wsj_1962	27	To simplify the calculations , commissions on the option and underlying stock are n't included in the table .
wsj_1962	28	There are more than 650 stocks on which options may be bought and sold , including some over-the-counter stocks .
wsj_1962	29	But some investors might prefer a simpler strategy then hedging their individual holdings .
wsj_1962	30	They can do this by purchasing `` index puts , '' which are simply put options on indexes that match broad baskets of stocks .
wsj_1962	31	For instance , the most popular index option is the S&P 100 option , commonly called the OEX .
wsj_1962	32	It is based on the stocks that make up Standard & Poor 's 100-stock index .
wsj_1962	33	Unlike options on individual issues , index options are settled only in cash , and no stock is ever tendered .
wsj_1962	34	But while index options are convenient , they have several disadvantages .
wsj_1962	35	For one thing , an investor 's portfolio might not closely match the S&P 100 .
wsj_1962	36	As a result , the OEX insurance may or may not fully protect an investor 's holdings in the event of a market decline .
wsj_1962	37	In addition , OEX options were suspended from trading last Friday afternoon , after the stock-market sell-off got under way and trading in the S&P-500 futures contract was halted .
wsj_1962	38	So an investor who wanted to realize a profit on OEX puts after the trading suspension would have been out of luck .
wsj_1962	39	On the other hand , only a handful of individual issues were suspended from trading on Friday .
wsj_1962	40	Normally , once the underlying investment is suspended from trading , the options on those investments also do n't trade .
wsj_1962	41	Ultimately , whether the insurance provided by purchasing puts is worthwhile depends on the cost of the options .
wsj_1962	42	That cost rises in times of high market volatility .
wsj_1962	43	But it still might be cheaper than taking a major hit .
wsj_1962	44	The protection from using married puts is clearly superior to that afforded by another options strategy some investors consider using during troubled times : selling call options on stocks the investor owns .
wsj_1962	45	A call option is similar to a put , except that it gives its owner the right to buy shares at a stated price until expiration .
wsj_1962	46	Selling a call option gives an investor a small buffer against a stock-market decline .
wsj_1962	47	That 's because it reduces the cost of the stock by the amount of premium received from the sale of the call .
wsj_1962	48	But if the price of the stock rises above the strike price of the option , the stock is almost certain to be called away .
wsj_1962	49	And in that case , the investor misses out on any major upside gain .
wsj_1962	50	These calculations exclude the effect of commissions paid and dividends received from the stock .
wsj_1962	51	All prices are as of Monday 's close .
wsj_1963	0	Hopes for quick enactment of pending deficit-reduction legislation faded as efforts to streamline the House version in advance of a House-Senate conference broke down .
wsj_1963	1	House leaders had hoped to follow the Senate 's lead by getting an agreement from House committee chairmen under which they would drop items that would n't reduce the fiscal 1990 budget deficit from the House-passed bill before the negotiations with the Senate began .
wsj_1963	2	But the effort became snagged on the question of what would become of other issues , ranging from cutting the capital-gains tax to child care to repeal of catastrophic-illness insurance .
wsj_1963	3	`` Many members feel there are important features of the House bill that should be enacted , '' Speaker Thomas Foley D. , Wash . said .
wsj_1963	4	`` If there is any support for reducing the bill , it is conditioned on their desire to see them passed in another form . ''
wsj_1963	5	Now those items will be discussed in a House-Senate conference , which could begin as soon as today , with the expectation that they could either be resolved there or placed into other legislation .

wsj_1973	1	The software company said revenue slid 28 % to $ 53.9 million .

wsj_1973	6	Edward M. Esber , chairman , president and chief executive officer , attributed the decline to reduced domestic revenue because of $ 4.9 million spent to upgrade existing software inventories to the new database IV Version 1.1 , and $ 1.8 million spent on the recent reduction in work force .
wsj_1973	7	He said the company was `` encouraged by feedback '' it received from selected customers now testing Version 1.1 .
wsj_1973	8	The red ink came as no surprise to Wall Street , but analysts said they saw ominous hints of a further delay in volume shipments of Version 1.1 , a harbinger of continued losses in the fourth quarter .

wsj_1973	10	He added gross margins and operating profit `` eroded quite dramatically '' from the prior quarter , along with sales of existing software product lines like Multimate and Framework .
wsj_1973	11	`` The success of a new product in the database line is needed .
wsj_1973	12	And while the company has n't made a definite statement , it now looks like that 's not going to be anytime soon , '' Mr. Maxwell said .
wsj_1973	13	The company said in a statement that it expects to ship new products `` during the next two quarters . ''
wsj_1973	14	`` It now looks like database IV Version 1.1 is n't going to be widely available until the first quarter of 1990 , '' said David Bayer , an analyst with Montgomery Securities in San Francisco .
wsj_1973	15	`` This is the second delay now in getting the product out the door .
wsj_1973	16	It does prolong the pain somewhat . ''
wsj_1973	17	Mr. Maxwell said unless the company can start shipments of the new product sometime this quarter , the fourth-quarter loss is likely to be `` comparable to the third quarter 's . ''
wsj_1973	18	If the company can start to ship during this quarter , it could stem some , if not all of the red ink , he said .

wsj_1999	4	Revenues rose 8.8 % to $ 4.35 billion from $ 4.0 billion .

wsj_1999	6	Earlier rate reductions in Texas and California reduced the quarter 's revenue and operating profit $ 55 million ; a year earlier , operating profit in telephone operations was reduced by a similar amount as a result of a provision for a reorganization .
wsj_1999	7	Revenue in the telecommunications products and services unit rose 27 % to $ 728.8 million , but operating profit was unchanged at $ 26.3 million , partly because of start-up expenses .
wsj_1999	8	Electrical products ' sales fell to $ 496.7 million from $ 504.5 million with higher world-wide lighting volume offset by lower domestic prices and the impact of weaker currencies in Europe and South America .

wsj_1999	18	The company said that residential traffic grew faster than business traffic and attributed that to its new PrimeTime calling plan that competes with American Telephone & Telegraph 's Reach Out America plan .
wsj_1999	19	MCI claims about 12 % of the overall long-distance telephone market but just under 10 % of the $ 23 billion residential market .
wsj_1999	20	It has been trying to improve its share of the residential market .
wsj_1999	21	The company wants its business mix to more closely match that of AT&T -- a step it says will help prevent cross subsidization .
wsj_1999	22	Mr. Akerson said MCI recorded `` another solid cash positive quarter , '' its fourth in a row , but declined to comment on whether the company is considering a dividend or is planning any acquisition .
wsj_1999	23	The current quarter , he said , `` looks fine .
wsj_1999	24	We think revenue will continue to grow and that we can control costs and thus improve profitability . ''
wsj_1999	25	Southwestern Bell Corp. said net dropped 8.7 % , mainly the result of four extraordinary items : a franchise tax refund that its Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. unit received last year ; a production shift of several Yellow Pages directories to the fourth quarter from the third ; a rate refund in Missouri and a one-time adjustment to phone company revenues .
wsj_1999	26	Revenue slipped 1.2 % to $ 2.21 billion from $ 2.23 billion .
wsj_1999	27	The earnings drop had been expected .

wsj_1999	34	In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange , Cincinnati Bell fell 25 cents to $ 29 .
wsj_1999	35	The company said that the number of access lines dropped slightly in the quarter , a decline attributed to seasonal fluctuations .
wsj_1999	36	For the year , however , access lines in service have increased 5.5 % .
wsj_1999	37	Chairman D.H. Hibbard said the company has set a new five year goal of doubling revenues to about $ 1.8 billion while steadily increasing net .

wsj_2003	4	Before the loan-loss addition , it said , it had operating profit of $ 10 million for the quarter .
wsj_2003	5	The move followed a round of similar increases by other lenders against Arizona real estate loans , reflecting a continuing decline in that market .
wsj_2003	6	In addition to the increased reserve , the savings bank took a special charge of $ 5 million representing general and administrative expenses from staff reductions and other matters , and it posted a $ 7.6 million reduction in expected mortgage servicing fees , reflecting the fact that more borrowers are prepaying their mortgages .

wsj_2007	2	The results were in line with analysts ' expectations .
wsj_2007	3	Merck , Rahway , N.J. , continued to lead the industry with a strong sales performance in the human and animal health-products segment .
wsj_2007	4	A stronger U.S. dollar reduced third-quarter and first-nine-month sales growth 2 % and 3 % , respectively .
wsj_2007	5	International sales accounted for 47 % of total company sales for the nine months , compared with 50 % a year earlier .
wsj_2007	6	Sales for the quarter rose to $ 1.63 billion from $ 1.47 billion .
wsj_2007	7	Mevacor , Merck 's new cholesterol-lowering drug , had higher sales than any other prescription medicine has ever achieved in the U.S. in the year following introduction , the company said .
wsj_2007	8	The drug was introduced in West Germany this year .
wsj_2007	9	Intense competition , however , led to unit sales declines for a group of Merck 's established human and animal-health products , including Aldomet and Indocin .

wsj_2007	20	Eli Lilly & Co .
wsj_2007	21	Lilly attributed record third-quarter and nine-month results to world-wide gains for pharmaceuticals , medical instruments and plant-science products despite poor exchange rates for the dollar that slowed sales abroad .
wsj_2007	22	Earnings continued to pace sales because of a lower tax rate , profit from the renegotiation of the debt instrument received from Faberge Inc. in connection with Lilly 's sale of Elizabeth Arden Inc. in 1987 , and net proceeds from the settlement of patent litigation at Lilly 's Hybritech Inc. unit .

wsj_2007	27	Advanced Cardiovascular Systems Inc. and Cardiac Pacemakers Inc. units led growth in the medical-instrument systems division .
wsj_2007	28	Lilly shares closed yesterday in composite trading on the Big Board at $ 62.25 , down 12.5 cents .
wsj_2008	0	Reuben Mark , chairman of Colgate-Palmolive Co. , said he is `` comfortable '' with analysts ' estimates that third-quarter earnings rose to between 95 cents and $ 1.05 a share .
wsj_2008	1	That compares with per-share earnings from continuing operations of 69 cents the year earlier ; including discontinued operations , per-share was 88 cents a year ago .
wsj_2008	2	The per-share estimates mean the consumer-products company 's net income , increased to between $ 69.5 million and $ 76 million , from $ 47.1 million the year-before period .
wsj_2008	3	Analysts estimate Colgate 's world-wide third-quarter sales rose about 8 % to $ 1.29 billion .
wsj_2008	4	Mr. Mark attributed the earnings growth to strong sales in Latin America , Asia and Europe .
wsj_2008	5	Results were also bolstered by `` a very meaningful '' increase in operating profit by Colgate 's U.S. business , Mr. Mark said .
wsj_2008	6	Operating profit at Colgate 's U.S. household products and personal-care businesses jumped 25 % in the quarter , Mr. Mark added .
wsj_2008	7	He said the improvement was a result of cost savings achieved by consolidating manufacturing operations , blending two sales organizations and focusing more carefully the company 's promotional activities .
wsj_2008	8	The estimated improvement in Colgate 's U.S. operations took some analysts by surprise .
wsj_2008	9	Colgate 's household products business , which includes such brands as Fab laundry detergent and Ajax cleanser , has been a weak performer .
wsj_2008	10	Analysts estimate Colgate 's sales of household products in the U.S. were flat for the quarter , and they estimated operating margins at only 1 % to 3 % .
wsj_2008	11	`` If you could say their business in the U.S. was mediocre , but great everywhere else , that would be fine , '' says Bonita Austin , an analyst with Wertheim Schroder & Co .
wsj_2008	12	`` But it 's not mediocre , it 's a real problem . ''
wsj_2008	13	Mr. Mark conceded that Colgate 's domestic business , apart from its highly profitable Hill 's Pet Products unit , has lagged .
wsj_2008	14	`` We 've done a lot to improve U.S. . results , and a lot more will be done , '' Mr. Mark said .
wsj_2008	15	`` Improving profitability of U.S. operations is an extremely high priority in the company . ''
wsj_2008	16	To focus on its global consumer-products business , Colgate sold its Kendall health-care business in 1988 .

wsj_2011	0	Deeply ingrained in both the book review `` Kissing Nature Good-bye '' by Stephen MacDonald Leisure & Arts , Sept. 27 and the books reviewed is the assumption that global warming is entirely a result of human activity .
wsj_2011	1	Is such a view justified ?
wsj_2011	2	In the absence of humans , would the Earth enjoy a constant climate over the long term ?
wsj_2011	3	About 20,000 years ago the last ice age ended .
wsj_2011	4	Enormous ice sheets retreated from the face of North America , northern Europe and Asia .
wsj_2011	5	This global warming must have been entirely natural -- nobody would blame it on a few hundred thousand hunter-gatherers hunting mammoths and scratching around in caves .
wsj_2011	6	Furthermore , no bell has yet rung to announce the end of this immense episode of natural global warming .
wsj_2011	7	It is probably continuing and may well account for most of , or all of , present-day global warming .
wsj_2011	8	I bow to no one in my regard for our terrestrial heritage , but if we are serious about global warming we must look at the big picture and not allow the Dominant Culture to lock us into the capitalist-exploiters-greedy-American-consumers-global - warming scenario as the sole model for discussion .

wsj_2012	0	The Internal Revenue Service plans to restructure itself more like a private corporation .
wsj_2012	1	In addition , the tax-collecting agency says that it will take the unusual step of looking to the private sector to fill two new high-level positions to guide the 120,000-employee agency : a comptroller to oversee daily finances and a chief information officer to update the information system , which includes probably the largest computer data base in the world .
wsj_2012	2	The IRS also said that it would create the position of chief financial officer , who will be hired from within the agency .
wsj_2012	3	IRS Commissioner Fred T. Goldberg said the changes are intended to bring `` accountability '' to the agency , which has an annual budget of more than $ 5 billion and collects about $ 1 trillion a year .
wsj_2012	4	`` My assessment and everyone 's assessment is that we do not have the kinds of information that let us responsibly and effectively formulate and execute our budget , '' Mr. Goldberg said .
wsj_2012	5	`` And we do n't have internal controls and discipline that we need to have to spend $ 5 billion properly . ''
wsj_2012	6	Mr. Goldberg , who took over as head of the IRS in July , has been disturbed by what he considers the inefficiency , waste and lack of coordination among the branches of the vast federal agency .
wsj_2012	7	The IRS operates on a computer system designed in 1961 , which it has been trying to modernize for years .
wsj_2012	8	And the agency , which operated throughout fiscal 1989 with a $ 360 million budget shortfall , has been under a hiring freeze since last fall .
wsj_2012	9	The new commissioner says that closer scrutiny of how the agency uses its resources will go a long way toward enhancing its ability to collect more tax revenue .
wsj_2012	10	`` I think that you will see a significant improvement in the budget formulation and execution process which , in turn , I believe will result in a significant increase in revenue , '' he said .
wsj_2012	11	The IRS hopes to fill the new positions soon .
wsj_2012	12	Customarily , it would appoint career civil servants from within the agency , but Mr. Goldberg said he plans to `` scour the world '' for the chief information officer and the comptroller .

wsj_2022	0	Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. , fulfilling its dismal earnings forecast for 1989 , said its third-quarter net income fell 68 % on flat revenue .
wsj_2022	1	Stung by higher marketing costs and slowing volume growth , the giant Coke bottling operation said net fell to $ 12.7 million , or six cents a share , from $ 39.9 million , or 26 cents a share , the year earlier .
wsj_2022	2	The results met estimates of analysts , who had already slashed their projections after the company said in late August that its 1989 earnings could tumble as much as 37 % .
wsj_2022	3	A company spokesman said yesterday that Coca-Cola Enterprises sticks by its 1989 forecast .
wsj_2022	4	Third-quarter revenue was flat at $ 1.02 billion .
wsj_2022	5	The year-ago results , however , included the operations of a bottling business , which was sold last December .
wsj_2022	6	Excluding that bottling business , Coca-Cola Enterprises ' volume , measured by cases of soda , rose only 1 % .
wsj_2022	7	The volume is well below the industry 's 4 % to 5 % growth rate of recent years , but in line with other soft-drink companies for the third quarter .
wsj_2022	8	The latest third-quarter volume also compares with a very strong 10 % growth in the year-ago quarter .
wsj_2022	9	Coca-Cola Enterprises blamed the lower volume on its soft-drink prices , which were about 3 % higher in the third quarter .
wsj_2022	10	Consumers have been accustomed to buying soft-drinks at discounted prices for several years .
wsj_2022	11	Coca-Cola Enterprises said it had to boost spending for trade and dealer incentives to try to keep volumes from slipping .
wsj_2022	12	The company said it expects consumers will adjust to higher-priced soft drinks .
wsj_2022	13	A spokesman attributed the bulk of a 14 % increase in selling , administrative and general expenses -- to $ 324.9 million -- to marketing costs .
wsj_2022	14	`` They 're out there promoting like crazy , trying to get prices up by promotion , '' said Roy Burry , an analyst with Kidder , Peabody & Co .
wsj_2022	15	For the nine months , Coca-Cola Enterprises ' net fell 31 % to $ 65 million , or 39 cents a share , from $ 93.8 million , or 63 cents a share .
wsj_2022	16	Revenue was flat at about $ 2.97 billion .
wsj_2022	17	Coca-Cola Enterprises , which is 49%-owned by Coca-Cola Co. , also said it repurchased about 1.2 million of its common shares during the third quarter .
wsj_2022	18	The buy-back is part of a 25-million-share repurchase plan , under which Coca-Cola Enterprises so far has acquired a total of 9.7 million shares .
wsj_2022	19	Separately , Purchase , N.Y.-based PepsiCo Inc. , as expected , said fiscal third-quarter net rose 11 % to $ 269.3 million , or $ 1.02 a share , from $ 241.6 million , or 91 cents a share .
wsj_2022	20	Sales rose 25 % to $ 3.90 billion from $ 3.13 billion .
wsj_2022	21	The year-ago quarter 's results include an after-tax charge of $ 5.9 million from the sale of a winery in Spain .
wsj_2022	22	In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange , Coca-Cola Enterprises closed at $ 16.375 a share , down 62.5 cents .
wsj_2022	23	PepsiCo closed at $ 58.50 a share , up $ 1.375 .
wsj_2023	0	L.J. Hooker Corp. is expected to reach an agreement in principle this week to sell Merksamer Jewelers Inc. to management , say executives familiar with the talks .
wsj_2023	1	L.J. Hooker , based in Atlanta , filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection earlier this year .
wsj_2023	2	Currently , its parent company , Hooker Corp. of Sydney , Australia , is being managed by a court-appointed liquidator .
wsj_2023	3	It is expected that GE Capital Corp. , a financial-services subsidiary of General Electric Co. , will provide much of the funding for the proposed leveraged buy-out of Merksamer , based in Sacramento , Calif .
wsj_2023	4	A spokesman for GE Capital declined to comment .
wsj_2023	5	GE Capital has a working relationship with L.J. Hooker .
wsj_2023	6	It is providing $ 50 million in emergency financing to the company and has agreed to buy as much as $ 75 million in receivables from B. Altman & Co. and Bonwit Teller , L.J. Hooker 's two fully owned department-store chains .
wsj_2023	7	Sam Merksamer , chief executive officer of the nationwide jewelry chain , and Sanford Sigoloff , chief executive of L.J. Hooker Corp. , both declined to comment .
wsj_2023	8	Currently , Mr. Merksamer owns 20 % of the company ; L.J. Hooker acquired its 80 % interest in the firm in May 1986 .
wsj_2023	9	At the time , the Merksamer chain had 11 stores in operation .
wsj_2023	10	Today , there are 77 units , all located in shopping malls .
wsj_2023	11	In recent weeks Mr. Merksamer has approached a number of his suppliers and asked them to provide letters of intent saying they will continue shipping merchandise to the chain following the buy-out , say those familiar with the situation .
wsj_2023	12	This year , a number of retail leveraged buyouts have failed , causing jitters among suppliers , and Mr. Merksamer apparently wanted assurances that he wo n't have delivery problems .
wsj_2023	13	For the year ended June 30 , 1989 , Merksamer Jewelers had $ 62 million of revenue and operating profit of $ 2.5 million .
wsj_2023	14	The jewelery chain was put up for sale in June .
wsj_2023	15	According to those familiar with the situation , other bidders included Ratners Group PLC of London and Kay Jewelers Inc .
wsj_2023	16	First Boston Corp. is advising L.J. Hooker on the sale of the Merksamer business .
wsj_2023	17	Merksamer was the first in a series of retail acquisitions made by L.J. Hooker .
wsj_2023	18	The company was founded in Sacramento in 1929 by two brothers , Ralph and Walter Merksamer , who operated as DeVon 's Jewelers .
wsj_2023	19	In 1979 , the pair split the company in half , with Walter and his son , Sam , agreeing to operate under the Merksamer Jewelery name .
wsj_2023	20	The sale of Merksamer Jewelers is subject to approval by Judge Tina Brozman of U.S. Bankruptcy Court .
wsj_2023	21	As earlier reported , L.J. Hooker this week received a $ 409 million bid for its three shopping malls , plus other properties from a consortium led by Honolulu real-estate investor Jay Shidler and A. Boyd Simpson , an Atlanta developer and former L.J. Hooker senior executive .
wsj_2023	22	The offer , which did n't include the Merksamer chain , is being reviewed by Mr. Sigoloff .
wsj_2024	0	Robert J. Regal was named president and chief executive officer of this company 's Universal-Rundle Corp. unit .
wsj_2024	1	Mr. Regal had been president and chief executive of RBS Industries Inc .
wsj_2024	2	Robert H. Carlson , previous president and chief executive of Universal-Rundle , will assume the title of chairman of the unit , a vitreous-china maker .
wsj_2026	0	Rohm & Haas Co. said third-quarter net income skidded 35 % to $ 32.6 million , or 49 cents a share .
wsj_2026	1	In the year-earlier quarter , the chemicals company had net of $ 49.8 million , or 75 cents a share .
wsj_2026	2	Sales were $ 623 million , up 0.5 % from $ 619.8 million a year ago .
wsj_2026	3	Rohm & Haas , which plans to start operating seven new production units this year , attributed the profit slide partly to higher start-up expense .
wsj_2026	4	The company also cited the stronger dollar , which cuts the value of overseas profit when it is translated into dollars .
wsj_2026	5	In addition , the company said , it was hurt by higher than previous-year costs for raw materials , though those costs have declined since the second quarter .
wsj_2026	6	Incrementally higher production of those chemicals which remain in heavy demand also has forced up costs , such as overtime pay .
wsj_2026	7	For the nine months , Rohm & Haas net totaled $ 155 million , or $ 2.33 a share , down 17 % from $ 187.8 million , or $ 2.82 a share , a year ago .
wsj_2026	8	Sales rose 5.2 % to $ 2.04 billion from $ 1.94 billion the previous year .
wsj_2026	9	In New York Stock Exchange composite trading , Rohm & Haas closed at $ 33 a share , down $ 1.75 .

wsj_2029	0	This is written to correct a misquotation in your Oct. 3 article `` Deaths From Advanced Colon Cancer Can Be Reduced by Using Two Drugs . ''
wsj_2029	1	In this article , I was alleged to have said , `` Any patient with high-risk colon cancer is really getting short shrift if he 's not getting this therapy . ''
wsj_2029	2	I did n't say this , and I 'm totally opposed to the philosophy expressed by the quote .
wsj_2029	3	I have not offered and will not offer routine therapy with the two drugs , levamisole and 5-fluorouracil , to any of my colon-cancer patients .
wsj_2029	4	With this treatment we have reduced deaths in high-risk colon cancer by one-third -- but this leaves the two-thirds who are dying of cancer .
wsj_2029	5	This is not nearly good enough .
wsj_2029	6	I believe any physician who truly cares about cancer patients , both today and tomorrow , should offer the hope of something better than that .
wsj_2029	7	My statement , read verbatim from a printed text available to all reporters attending the National Cancer Institute news conference , was the following : `` New clinical trials are already in operation seeking to improve these results .
wsj_2029	8	These research protocols offer to the patient not only the very best therapy which we have established today but also the hope of something still better .
wsj_2029	9	I feel any patient with high-risk cancer is getting short shrift if he is not offered this opportunity . ''
wsj_2029	10	We have very exciting prospects for far more impressive advances in the treatment of colon cancer during the years immediately ahead .
wsj_2029	11	This hope , however , will never be realized if we use levamisole and 5-fluorouracil as a stopping point .

wsj_2030	0	The oil and auto industries , united in their dislike of President Bush 's proposal for cars that run on alternative fuels , announced a joint research program that could turn up a cleaner-burning gasoline .
wsj_2030	1	Officials of the Big Three auto makers and 14 petroleum companies said they are setting out to find the most cost-effective fuel for reducing cities ' air-pollution problems , with no bias toward any fuel in particular .
wsj_2030	2	However , their search notably wo n't include natural gas or pure methanol -- the two front-running alternative fuels -- in tests to be completed by next summer .
wsj_2030	3	Instead , the tests will focus heavily on new blends of gasoline , which are still undeveloped but which the petroleum industry has been touting as a solution for automobile pollution that is choking urban areas .
wsj_2030	4	Environmentalists criticized the program as merely a public-relations attempt to head off a White House proposal to require a million cars a year that run on cleaner-burning fuels by 1997 .
wsj_2030	5	While major oil companies have been experimenting with cleaner-burning gasoline blends for years , only Atlantic Richfield Co. is now marketing a lower-emission gasoline for older cars currently running on leaded fuel .
wsj_2030	6	The initial $ 11 million research program will conduct the most extensive testing to date of reformulated gasolines , said Joe Colucci , head of fuels and lubricants at General Motors Corp. research laboratories .
wsj_2030	7	It will compare 21 different blends of gasolines with three mixtures of up to 85 % methanol .
wsj_2030	8	A second phase of research , which is still being planned , will test reformulated gasolines on newer engine technologies now being developed for use in 1992 or 1993 cars .
wsj_2030	9	There was no cost estimate for the second phase .
wsj_2030	10	`` The whole idea here is the automobile and oil companies have joint customers , '' said Keith McHenry , a senior vice president of technology at Amoco Corp .
wsj_2030	11	`` And we are looking for the most cost-effective way to clean up the air . ''
wsj_2030	12	But David Hawkins , an environmental lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense Council , said the research appears merely to be a way to promote reformulated gasoline .
wsj_2030	13	Oil and auto companies supported a move on Capitol Hill last week to gut Mr. Bush 's plans to require auto makers to begin selling alternative-fueled cars by 1995 .
wsj_2030	14	Instead , a House subcommittee adopted a clean-fuels program that specifically mentions reformulated gasoline as an alternative .
wsj_2030	15	The Bush administration has said it will try to resurrect its plan when the House Energy and Commerce Committee takes up a comprehensive clean-air bill .
wsj_2031	0	William Seidman , chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. , said Lincoln Savings & Loan Association should have been seized by the government in 1986 to contain losses that he estimated will cost taxpayers as much as $ 2 billion .
wsj_2031	1	Mr. Seidman , who has been the nation 's top bank regulator , inherited the problems of Lincoln , based in Irvine , Calif. , after his regulatory role was expanded by the new savings-and-loan bailout law .
wsj_2031	2	He made his comments before House Banking Committee hearings to investigate what appears to be the biggest thrift disaster in a scandal-ridden industry .
wsj_2031	3	The inquiry also will cover the actions of Charles Keating Jr. , who is chairman of American Continental Corp. , Lincoln 's parent , and who contributed heavily to several U.S. senators .
wsj_2031	4	Mr. Seidman told the committee that the Resolution Trust Corp. , the agency created to sell sick thrifts , has studied Lincoln 's examination reports by former regulators dating back to 1986 .
wsj_2031	5	`` My staff indicated that had we made such findings in one of our own institutions , we would have sought an immediate cease-and-desist order to stop the hazardous operations , '' Mr. Seidman said .
wsj_2031	6	When Lincoln was seized by the government , for example , 15 % of its loans , or $ 250 million , were to borrowers who were buying real estate from one of American Continental 's 50 other subsidiaries , according to Mr. Seidman .
wsj_2031	7	But the government did n't step in until six months ago , when thrift officials put Lincoln into conservatorship -- the day after American Continental filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from creditors .
wsj_2031	8	The bankruptcy filing , the government has charged in a $ 1.1 billion civil lawsuit , was part of a pattern to shift insured deposits to the parent company , which used the deposits as a cache for real-estate deals .
wsj_2031	9	The deposits that have been transferred to other subsidiaries are now under the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court .
wsj_2031	10	`` I think it 's fairly clear Mr. Keating knew , '' that regulators were set to seize Lincoln , Mr. Seidman said .
wsj_2031	11	Further investigation , he said , may result in further actions against Lincoln 's executives , said Mr. Seidman , `` including fraud actions . ''
wsj_2031	12	Mr. Keating , for his part , has filed suit alleging that regulators unlawfully seized the thrift .
wsj_2031	13	Leonard Bickwit , an attorney in Washington for Mr. Keating , declined to comment on the hearings , except to say , `` We will be responding comprehensively in several forums to each of these allegations at the appropriate time . ''
wsj_2031	14	Lincoln 's treatment by former thrift regulators , in an agency disbanded by the new law , has proved embarrassing for five senators who received thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from Mr. Keating .
wsj_2031	15	Mr. Seidman said yesterday , for example , that Sen. Dennis DeConcini D. , Ariz. , who received $ 48,100 in contributions from Mr. Keating , phoned Mr. Seidman to request that he push for a sale of Lincoln before it would be seized .
wsj_2031	16	After the government lawsuit was filed against Lincoln , Sen. DeConcini returned the campaign contributions .
wsj_2031	17	The senator 's spokesman said yesterday that he pushed for the sale of Lincoln because `` hundreds of Arizona jobs at Lincoln were on the line . ''
wsj_2031	18	Senate Banking Committee Chairman Donald Riegle D. , Mich . has also returned contributions he received from Mr. Keating a year ago .
wsj_2031	19	Sens. John Glenn D. , Ohio , John McCain , R. , Ariz. and Alan Cranston D. , Calif. also received substantial contributions from Mr. Keating and sought to intervene on behalf of Lincoln .
wsj_2031	20	House Banking Committee Chairman Henry Gonzalez D. , Texas said Sen. Cranston volunteered to appear before the House committee , if necessary .
wsj_2031	21	But a committee staff member said the panel is unlikely to pursue closely the role of the senators .
wsj_2031	22	At the hearing , Mr. Seidman said the RTC has already pumped $ 729 million into Lincoln for liquidity .
wsj_2031	23	He also held out little hope of restitution for purchasers of $ 225 million in American Continental subordinated debt .
wsj_2031	24	Some of those debtholders have filed a suit , saying they believed they were buying government-insured certificates of deposit .
wsj_2031	25	`` We have no plans at this time to pay off those notes , '' he said .
wsj_2032	0	Eastern Airlines ' creditors committee , unhappy with the carrier 's plans for emerging from bankruptcy-law proceedings , asked its own experts to devise alternate approaches to a reorganization .
wsj_2032	1	Representatives of the accounting firm of Ernst & Young and the securities firm of Goldman , Sachs & Co. , hired by creditors to consult on Eastern 's financial plans , told the committee in a private meeting yesterday that Eastern 's latest plan to emerge from bankruptcy-law protection is far riskier than an earlier one which won the creditors ' approval .
wsj_2032	2	According to one person present at the meeting , Eastern 's new plan is financially `` overly optimistic . ''
wsj_2032	3	Asked about the consultants ' reports , an Eastern spokeswoman said `` we totally disagree . ''
wsj_2032	4	She said they have `` oversimplified and made some erroneous assumptions that make their analysis completely off-base . ''
wsj_2032	5	At a later news conference here , Frank Lorenzo , chairman of Eastern 's parent Texas Air Corp. , said Eastern was exceeding its goals for getting back into operation and predicted it would emerge from Chapter 11 protection from creditors early next year , operating with more service than it originally had scheduled .
wsj_2032	6	He insisted , as he has before , that creditors would be paid in full under the plan .
wsj_2032	7	Mr. Lorenzo made no mention of creditors ' negative response to his plan .
wsj_2032	8	`` We 're in the process of discussing an amended plan with the creditors and anticipate filing that amended plan shortly , '' Mr. Lorenzo told reporters .
wsj_2032	9	`` We 're meeting and surpassing our goals , '' he added .
wsj_2032	10	In July , Eastern and its creditors agreed on a reorganization plan that called for Eastern to sell $ 1.8 billion in assets and to emerge from bankruptcy-law protection at two-thirds its former size .
wsj_2032	11	But after selling off pieces such as its East Coast shuttle , its Philadelphia hub and various planes , Eastern hit a stumbling block .
wsj_2032	12	It could n't sell its South American routes , one of the major assets marked for disposal .
wsj_2032	13	Those routes , valued by the creditors ' professionals at about $ 400 million , were to be sold to AMR Corp. 's American Airlines .
wsj_2032	14	A last-minute snag in negotiations with AMR , over an unrelated lawsuit between American and another Texas Air unit , caused the deal to collapse .
wsj_2032	15	Eastern ultimately decided it would have to keep and operate the routes itself , which would leave it with less cash for its reorganization .
wsj_2032	16	It also would leave Eastern a bigger carrier than the scaled-down one proposed under the initial plan .
wsj_2032	17	Those changes in its condition meant the reorganization plan previously presented to creditors would have to be revamped .
wsj_2032	18	Since then , Eastern has been negotiating with creditors over revisions , but the creditors committee has been having problems with the revisions .
wsj_2032	19	The committee has two groups of experts it calls on to analyze Eastern 's plans .
wsj_2032	20	Both said the new plan would n't work .
wsj_2032	21	Ernst & Young said Eastern 's plans will miss its projections of earnings before interest , tax and depreciation by $ 100 million , and that Eastern 's plan presented no comfort level , according to a source present at yesterday 's session .
wsj_2032	22	Experts from Goldman Sachs estimated Eastern would miss the same mark by $ 120 million to $ 135 million , the source said .
wsj_2032	23	The experts said they expected Eastern would have to issue new debt to cover its costs , and that it would generate far less cash than anticipated .
wsj_2032	24	Other costs also would increase , including maintenance , because Eastern has an older fleet .
wsj_2032	25	At the news conference , Mr. Lorenzo and Eastern President Phil Bakes presented a far rosier assessment .
wsj_2032	26	Flanked by flight attendants , pilots and gate agents dressed in spiffy new blue uniforms , they said Eastern has exceeded its operational goals and is filling its seats .
wsj_2032	27	Starting next month , Eastern will begin flying 775 flights daily instead of the previously announced 700 , they said .
wsj_2032	28	Mr. Bakes declined to give out Eastern 's daily losses , but said he did n't expect Eastern would have to dip into the cash from asset sales currently held in escrow .
wsj_2032	29	These accounts hold several hundred million dollars , primarily from asset sales .
wsj_2032	30	The plan Eastern hopes to pursue , he said , calls for Eastern to have $ 390 million in cash by year 's end .
wsj_2032	31	Both he and Mr. Lorenzo predicted that plan might be confirmed in January .
wsj_2032	32	As to negotiations with creditors , Mr. Lorenzo said in remarks after the conference `` we 'll have to see how they talks come along . ''
wsj_2032	33	However , he added , `` it 's not a requirement that the plan be accepted by creditors .
wsj_2032	34	It must be accepted by the court . ''
wsj_2032	35	Under bankruptcy law , Eastern has exclusive rights for a certain period to develop its own reorganization plan .
wsj_2032	36	That deadline has been extended once and could be extended again .
wsj_2032	37	If Eastern can get creditor support , court confirmation of its plan could be relatively swift .
wsj_2032	38	But creditors are free to press for court approval of their own plan , or the court could ignore both sides and draw its own .
wsj_2032	39	In any event , some people familiar with the case question whether the court will act by January as forecast by Mr. Lorenzo and Mr. Bakes .
wsj_2032	40	Eastern sought bankruptcy-law protection a few days after a crippling strike began March 4 .
wsj_2032	41	Mr. Lorenzo told reporters the reorganization Eastern is pursuing would create a carrier 85 % to 90 % of the size of the pre-bankruptcy Eastern .
wsj_2032	42	He projected it would be operating about 1,000 flights a day by late spring , only slightly fewer than the carrier 's old volume of 1,050 a day .

wsj_2039	0	Weyerhaeuser Co. reported a one-time gain and strong wood-product sales that offset weakness in pulp and paper to fuel a 15 % jump in third-quarter net income to $ 166.8 million , or 78 cents a share .
wsj_2039	1	In the 1988 third quarter , the forest-products company reported profit of $ 144.9 million , or 69 cents a share .
wsj_2039	2	Sales rose 9 % to $ 2.57 billion from $ 2.36 billion .
wsj_2039	3	For the nine months , the company posted a 14 % rise in profit to $ 469.8 million , or $ 2.21 a share , from $ 410.3 million , or $ 1.95 a share .
wsj_2039	4	Sales rose 9 % to $ 7.54 billion from $ 6.95 billion .
wsj_2039	5	Results for the 1989 third quarter and nine months include a pretax loss of $ 33 million from the company 's business improvement and refocusing program , and a gain of $ 49 million on the sale of a subsidiary 's common stock .
wsj_2039	6	Forest-products operations strengthened in the third quarter , while paper operations were dogged by higher costs , soft newsprint exports and a strong Japanese yen .
wsj_2039	7	Some competing forest-products firms have recently reported improved results due to strong pulp and paper business .
wsj_2039	8	Weyerhaeuser 's pulp and paper operations were up for the nine months , but full-year performance depends on the balance of operating and maintenance costs , plus pricing of certain products , the company said .
wsj_2039	9	Looking ahead to the fourth quarter , the company said export log and lumber markets will be weak , while panel and plywood markets will be stronger .
wsj_2039	10	Pulp and paper performance depends on cost and price variables , the company said .
wsj_2042	0	Parsow Partnership Ltd. and Elkhorn Partners L.P. said they may seek proposals from third parties relating to a sale or restructuring of CACI International Inc .
wsj_2042	1	In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission , Parsow and Elkhorn , which together hold 8.685 % of CACI 's common shares , said they think it is in the best interest of CACI stockholders that the company be sold .
wsj_2042	2	CACI , based in Arlington , Va. , said it had n't seen the filing by Parsow and Elkhorn and therefore had no comment .
wsj_2042	3	The partnerships said they may seek board representation , and they may seek the support of CACI 's board and other major shareholders in connection with their plans .
wsj_2042	4	According to the filing , Parsow and Elkhorn are based in Elkhorn , Neb. , and are controlled by the same general partner , Alan S. Parsow .
wsj_2042	5	Their combined stake consists of 880,500 CACI common shares , including 86,500 shares bought in the past 60 days at $ 2.3125 to $ 2.4375 a share .
wsj_2042	6	Additional shares may be bought or sold in the open market , in private transactions or otherwise , depending on market conditions and other factors .
wsj_2044	0	A House-Senate conference approved an estimated $ 67 billion fiscal 1990 spending bill that provides a 28 % increase for space research and development and incorporates far-reaching provisions affecting the federal mortgage market .
wsj_2044	1	The current ceiling on home loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration would be increased to $ 124,875 .
wsj_2044	2	Separately , the bill gives authority to the Bush administration to facilitate the refinancing of federally subsidized loans for low-income and moderate-income homeowners .
wsj_2044	3	The second provision , affecting so-called 235 mortgages , has met strong opposition from investment bankers represented by the Public Securities Association .
wsj_2044	4	And a squad of influential former Senate aides employed by the Wall Street firm Salomon Brothers came to the Capitol in a vain attempt to strip the provision .
wsj_2044	5	By an 11-2 margin , Senate negotiators voted to preserve the 235 mortgage refinancing plan , and despite powerful allies , the opposition found itself undercut by an unusual alliance of liberals and conservatives .
wsj_2044	6	The government currently is subsidizing an estimated 23,000 loans above 11 % under the 235 program , and however disruptive to private investors , the refinancing is expected to yield at least $ 15 million in savings in fiscal 1990 .
wsj_2044	7	This sum has been guarded jealously by appropriators anxious to offset spending elsewhere , and conservative Sen. Phil Gramm cast the fight as a populist stand against monied interests .
wsj_2044	8	`` We are stewards here , not of the mortgage companies , but the taxpayers , '' said the Texas Republican .
wsj_2044	9	The action came as the administration won final congressional approval of $ 9 million in assistance for elections scheduled in Nicaragua in February .
wsj_2044	10	The bulk of the money would be funneled through the National Endowment for Democracy , but the legislation is so vaguely written that it has been dogged by questions regarding the money 's true purpose and its ultimate destination .
wsj_2044	11	The Senate had refused late Friday to invoke cloture and limit debate , but behind the bipartisan leadership , a solid majority took shape yesterday and brushed aside amendments seeking to cut the total package or steer it away from direct aid to political parties .
wsj_2044	12	Final approval -- on a 64-35 roll call -- was never in doubt , but the opposition drew an unusual mix of senators , including Republicans Jesse Helms and Warren Rudman and Democrats Bill Bradley and John Glenn .
wsj_2044	13	The money will be applied for voter registration and election monitoring , but more than half is likely to go to the Union Nacional Opositora party .
wsj_2044	14	Critics warned such cash contributions may only undercut the opposition party 's standing , and one irony is that under Nicaraguan law a major portion of the opposition party 's funds must be shared with the government 's Supreme Electoral Council .
wsj_2044	15	Within the appropriations conference yesterday , the $ 67 billion measure is the second largest of the annual domestic spending bills and covers a disparate collection of accounts for science , housing , veterans and the environment .
wsj_2044	16	The decision to raise the ceiling on FHA home loans still faces strong opposition in the House .
wsj_2044	17	But it is driven by the same fiscal pressures that have forced lawmakers to resort to various bookkeeping devices to juggle as much as $ 1 billion in spending that would otherwise put the bill over budget .
wsj_2044	18	These costs will complicate the budget picture in fiscal 1991 , and the measure further commits Congress to a set of costly projects , including the first construction funds for the space station .
wsj_2044	19	The station is promised $ 1.8 billion within the $ 5.36 billion provided for research and development in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration , and the nation 's high-speed aerospace plane -- cut by the Senate -- could receive as much as $ 60 million in new funds or transfers .
wsj_2044	20	Similarly , the House agreed to add back $ 62 million to continue work on the advanced communications technology satellite , being developed by General Electric Co .
wsj_2044	21	And while setting a statutory limit of $ 1.6 billion on the automated space probe , the conference appropriated $ 30 million for the start-up of the CRAF-Cassini mission , a successor to the Voyager space probe .
wsj_2044	22	Among major domestic agencies , the Environmental Protection Agency stands to receive increases significantly beyond those sought by the administration , with pollution abatement and control accounts growing by 14 % to about $ 829.9 million .
wsj_2044	23	An estimated $ 1.57 billion is separately allocated for the National Science Foundation , and within the Housing and Urban Development Department , more than $ 9.2 billion is provided for federally assisted housing , including an expanded effort to modernize public housing units that serve the poorest families .
wsj_2044	24	To an unusual degree , the massive bill has become a vehicle for lawmakers to earmark funds for projects in home states .
wsj_2044	25	While the practice was discouraged in the past , the conference agreement is laced with veterans ' hospitals , environmental projects and urban grants designated for specific communities .
wsj_2044	26	The most striking example yesterday may have been in community development funds , where the two houses had separately approved a total of 27 projects valued at $ 20 million , and the conference added 15 more valued at $ 8 million to ostensibly preserve `` balance '' between the House and Senate .
wsj_2044	27	Yesterday 's conference agreement is the second major bill to emerge from negotiations this week , as appropriators approved a fiscal 1990 transportation bill late Monday that includes a sweeping ban on smoking on most domestic airline flights .
wsj_2044	28	An exemption will remain for flights longer than six hours to Hawaii and Alaska , but estimates by the tobacco industry yesterday indicate all but about 30 flights would be covered .
wsj_2044	29	Separately , a third conference report covering an $ 18.4 billion Treasury and Postal Service bill was sent to the Senate after passing the House on a 383-30 roll call yesterday .
wsj_2044	30	And after weeks of delay , the appropriations process is beginning to take some final shape .
wsj_2044	31	Defense and foreign aid are the two most critical areas remaining from the administration 's standpoint .
wsj_2044	32	And among domestic programs , the most serious threat is White House opposition to abortion riders attached to separate bills funding the District of Columbia and Department of Health and Human Services .
wsj_2044	33	The same issue threatens to spill over to the foreign aid debate , and Mr. Bush also is threatening to veto any agreement that preserves Senate-passed provisions renewing U.S. support for the United Nations Fund for Population Activities .
wsj_2044	34	In a sharply written letter , Rep. David Obey , chairman of the House appropriations subcommittee for foreign operations , warned Mr. Bush that the result of his `` ultimatum '' could weaken efforts to accommodate the administration elsewhere .
wsj_2044	35	`` As a result of your ultimatum , '' writes the Wisconsin Democrat , `` I guess there is no longer any point in taking administration views into account on other items in conference , inasmuch regardless of their resolution you apparently intend to veto this bill .
wsj_2045	0	Markets usually get noticed because they soar or plunge .
wsj_2045	1	Gold , which has n't risen or fallen significantly in quite some time , yesterday achieved what may be a new level of impassiveness : The most actively traded futures contracts closed unchanged despite nervous fluctuations in both the dollar and the stock market .
wsj_2045	2	The settlement prices of the December , February and April gold contracts were even with Monday 's final prices .
wsj_2045	3	The December 1989 contract , which has the greatest trading volume , ended at $ 371.20 an ounce .
wsj_2045	4	The other months posted advances of 10 cents to 20 cents an ounce .
wsj_2045	5	According to one analyst , Bernard Savaiko of PaineWebber , New York , the stock market 's ability on Monday to rally from last Friday 's decline -- which seemed to indicate that the economy was n't going to fall either -- took the starch out of precious metals prices , and out of gold 's , in particular .
wsj_2045	6	Yesterday , gold traded within a narrow range .
wsj_2045	7	Gold tried to rally on Monday but ran into the same situation that has subdued gold prices for more than a year : selling by gold producers , who want to fix the highest possible price for their gold .
wsj_2045	8	`` December delivery gold is trading in a range of $ 365 to $ 375 an ounce and is having difficulty breaking out above that , '' Mr. Savaiko said .
wsj_2045	9	`` Producers at the moment regard that area a good one in which to sell gold . ''
wsj_2045	10	Also , Mr. Savaiko noted , stock market investors seeking greater safety are veering toward buying bonds rather than precious metals because `` we are tending more toward a disinflationary economy that does n't make gold and precious metals attractive . ''
wsj_2045	11	Jeffrey Nichols , president of APMS Canada , Toronto precious metals advisers , said there is little to motivate gold traders to buy the metal .
wsj_2045	12	`` Investors in the U.S. and Europe are comfortable with the actions of the Federal Reserve in its willingness to supply liquidity to financial system , which helped the stock market rebound on Monday , '' he said .
wsj_2045	13	There is n't any rush on the part of investors in the West to buy gold , he said .
wsj_2045	14	`` They still bear the memory of October 1987 , when they bought gold after the stock market crashed and ended up losing money because gold prices subsequently fell , '' Mr. Nichols said .
wsj_2045	15	`` It 's an experience they do n't want to repeat . ''
wsj_2045	16	At the moment gold traders are n't concerned about inflation , he said , and as for the dollar , `` gold 's association with the currency has been diminishing recently so drops in the currency are n't having much impact on gold . ''
wsj_2045	17	Dinsa Mehta , chief bullion trader for Chase Manhattan Bank , said : `` There is little incentive on the part of traders to sell gold because the stock market may go lower and gold may retain some of its ` flight to safety ' quality .
wsj_2045	18	There is little incentive to buy gold because if the stock market goes higher , it may be just a false alarm .
wsj_2045	19	This is keeping the gold traders handcuffed . ''
wsj_2045	20	The most remarkable feature about yesterday 's action was that the price of roughly $ 370 an ounce was regarded as attractive enough by gold producers around the world to aggressively sell gold , Mr. Mehta said .
wsj_2045	21	`` I do n't know what it means over the long run , but for the short term , it appears that gold producers are grateful for the $ 10 or so that gold has risen over the past week or so , '' he said .
wsj_2045	22	Previously , he noted , gold producers tended to back off from a rising gold market , letting prices rise as much as possible before selling .
wsj_2045	23	Mr. Mehta observed that the U.S. merchandise trade deficit , which rose sharply in August , according to yesterday 's report , has been having less and less impact on the gold market .
wsj_2045	24	`` The dollar has n't reacted much to it , so gold has n't either , '' he said .
wsj_2045	25	In other commodity markets yesterday :
wsj_2045	26	Crude oil prices rose slightly in lackluster activity as traders in the pits tried to assess action in the stock market .
wsj_2045	27	Since stock market indexes plummeted last Friday , participants in all markets have been wary .
wsj_2045	28	When traders become confident that the stock market has stabilized , oil prices are expected to rise as supply and demand fundamentals once again become the major consideration .
wsj_2045	29	Crude oil for November delivery edged up by 16 cents a barrel to $ 20.75 a barrel .
wsj_2045	30	Heating oil prices also rose .
wsj_2045	31	November gasoline slipped slightly .
wsj_2045	32	Futures prices rose on a report that Cuba may seek to postpone some sugar shipments .
wsj_2045	33	The March contract advanced 0.14 cent a pound to 14.11 cents .
wsj_2045	34	According to an analyst , Cuba ca n't meet all its shipment commitments and has asked Japan to accept a delay of shipments scheduled for later this year , into early next year .
wsj_2045	35	`` Japan is perceived as a wealthy nation that can turn elsewhere in the world market and buy the sugar , '' the analyst said .
wsj_2045	36	It was the possibility of this demand that helped firm prices , the analyst said .
wsj_2045	37	Another analyst noted that Cuba has been deferring shipments in recent years .
wsj_2045	38	`` To the professionals in the trade it did n't cause much surprise .
wsj_2045	39	The March futures contract traded as high as 14.24 cents , but could n't sustain the advance , '' he said .
wsj_2045	40	The prices of cattle , hogs and pork belly futures contracts rebounded as livestock traders shook off fears that the Friday stock market plunge would chill consumer spending , which in turn would hurt retail sales of beef and pork .
wsj_2045	41	The prices of most livestock futures contracts had dropped sharply Monday .
wsj_2045	42	Cattle futures prices were also supported yesterday by signs that supermarket chains are making plans to increase their promotions concerning beef .
wsj_2045	43	The prices of most soybean and soybean-meal futures contracts rose amid rumors that the Soviet Union is interested in buying from the U.S. or South America about 250,000 metric tons of soybeans and as many as 400,000 metric tons of soybean meal .
wsj_2045	44	Traders are especially sensitive to reports of possible U.S. soybean sales because U.S. exports are lagging .
wsj_2045	45	Since Sept. 1 , about 13 million fewer bushels of U.S. soybeans have been sold overseas than for the same period last year .
wsj_2045	46	Corn futures prices rose slightly while wheat prices settled mixed .
wsj_2046	0	Moody 's Investors Service Inc. , fretting about increasing competitive pressure on Ryder , placed about $ 2.8 billion in company securities under review for possible downgrade .
wsj_2046	1	Ratings under review are Ryder 's A-1 collateral trust debentures , A-2 senior notes and bonds , A-2 preferred stock and the company 's Prime-1 rating for commercial paper .
wsj_2046	2	Moody 's said it is assessing the strategies Ryder 's management may follow in addressing significant challenges in some major markets .
wsj_2046	3	The rating agency said it is focusing especially on the transportation service company 's efforts to control costs , improve margins and enhance its competitive position in its primary business , vehicle leasing and rental .
wsj_2049	0	Banc One Corp. said Frank E. McKinney plans to retire as the bank holding company 's president effective Jan. 12 .
wsj_2049	1	Banc One said `` it is contemplated '' that John B. McCoy , chairman and chief executive officer , will assume the additional position of president upon Mr. McKinney 's retirement .
wsj_2049	2	Mr. McKinney , 50 years old , was chairman and chief executive of American Fletcher Corp. , Indianapolis , when that bank holding company merged into Banc One in January 1987 .
wsj_2049	3	The company said Mr. McKinney plans to retire because the process of affiliating American Fletcher into Banc One `` is considered completed . ''
wsj_2049	4	Mr. McKinney will continue as chairman of the board and chairman of the executive committee of Banc One Indiana Corp. , the successor company to American Fletcher Corp. , but will no longer be active in day-to-day management .
wsj_2049	5	He will remain on the Banc One board .
wsj_2050	0	The Treasury plans to raise $ 1.55 billion in new cash with the sale Monday of about $ 15.6 billion in short-term bills to redeem $ 14.1 billion in maturing bills .
wsj_2050	1	The offering will be divided evenly between 13-week and 26-week bills maturing on Jan. 25 , 1990 , and April 26 , 1990 , respectively .
wsj_2050	2	Tenders for the bills , available in minimum $ 10,000 denominations , must be received by 1 p.m. EDT Monday at the Treasury or at Federal Reserve banks or branches .
wsj_2051	0	Moody 's Investors Service Inc. said it lowered ratings on about $ 650 million of Beatrice Co. debt , citing the closely held Chicago food concern 's proposed recapitalization .
wsj_2051	1	The ratings concern said it downgraded Beatrice notes , Euronotes and certain industrial revenue bonds to single-B-1 from Ba-3 and the company 's subordinated debentures to single-B-3 from single-B-2 .
wsj_2051	2	Moody 's said the proposed recaptilization may `` limit the company 's ability to realize its profit potential '' and that paying dividends from a new series of preferred could squeeze `` basic business operations . ''
wsj_2051	3	A Beatrice spokesman did n't return calls seeking comment .
wsj_2051	4	Beatrice , which went private in an $ 8.2 billion leveraged buy-out in 1986 , said last month that it might borrow again to help pay investors as much as $ 983 million in preferred stock and debt securities .
wsj_2056	0	Polaroid Corp. , benefiting from staff-reduction savings , reported a strong gain in third-quarter operating results and net income of $ 29.9 million , or 40 cents a share , after preferred-stock requirements .
wsj_2056	1	Analysts said the numbers were better than expectations , partly because of strong profit margins and a positive foreign-currency translation .
wsj_2056	2	However , they said the company 's flat revenue was a disappointment , and an indication that sales of Polaroid 's new conventional film in the U.S. have been sluggish .
wsj_2056	3	Revenue in the third quarter was $ 437.7 million , almost unchanged from $ 436.3 million a year earlier .
wsj_2056	4	Polaroid reported operating profit before taxes and interest costs of $ 63.1 million for the third quarter , more than double the year-before $ 24 million .
wsj_2056	5	Charges for staff cuts and other restructuring produced a net loss of $ 54.1 million , or 77 cents a share , in 1988 's third quarter .
wsj_2056	6	`` I 'm somewhat skeptical about the underlying demand '' for Polaroid products , said Michael Ellmann , an analyst with Wertheim Schroder & Co .
wsj_2056	7	`` If you believe that a good performance next year is contingent on an acceleration of revenue , there is n't a lot here to base optimism on . ''
wsj_2056	8	Alex Henderson , an analyst with Prudential-Bache , says Polaroid officials told him yesterday that U.S. sales of the company 's new conventional film product , introduced in the second quarter , have been `` disappointing '' after a promising start .
wsj_2056	9	Sam Yanes , a Polaroid spokesman , said `` I do n't know about disappointing , '' but added that the company has n't been able to get the product on the shelves of some mass-merchandise , discount retailers that it had hoped would be carrying the product already .
wsj_2056	10	Mr. Yanes said the film , One Film , is currently carried at about 15,000 retail outlets , including drugstores and supermarkets .
wsj_2056	11	For the nine months , Polaroid reported earnings of $ 98.5 million , or $ 1.27 a share .
wsj_2056	12	Last year , the company had a nine-month loss of $ 15.1 million , or 23 cents a share .
wsj_2056	13	In New York Stock Exchange composite trading , Polaroid closed at $ 47 , up $ 1.125 .
wsj_2060	0	Corning Inc. posted a 38 % decline in third-quarter net income to $ 76.5 million , or 80 cents a share , from $ 123.9 million , or $ 1.37 a share , a year earlier .
wsj_2060	1	The year-earlier figure included a one-time gain of $ 59.9 million from the sale of Corning 's stakes in Japanese businesses .
wsj_2060	2	Without the gain , operating profit was $ 64 million , or 71 cents a share .
wsj_2060	3	The telecommunications , specialty glass , ceramic products and laboratory-services concern said the latest quarter included a tax-loss carry-forward of $ 600,000 .
wsj_2060	4	A year earlier , net included a $ 700,000 taxlow carry-forward .
wsj_2060	5	Sales rose 14 % to $ 715 million from $ 625.4 million .
wsj_2060	6	Corning 's chairman and chief executive officer , James R. Houghton , said operating performance continued to be strong in the telecommunications and health and science segments .
wsj_2060	7	But the specialty-material segment slowed somewhat and consumer products continued below expectations .
wsj_2060	8	As for joint ventures , Mr. Houghton said profit was `` essentially flat '' due primarily to a slow recovery at Samsung-Corning Co. in Korea following a strike at a major customer and the disruption of shipments to China .
wsj_2060	9	Also , profit was hurt by the strength of the dollar overseas which negatively affected the company 's currency-exchange rate .
wsj_2060	10	In New York Stock Exchange composite trading , Corning closed at $ 38.50 , down 75 cents .
wsj_2062	0	ONE LIBERTY PROPERTIES Inc. declared a dividend of 40 cents a share on its $ 16.50 cumulative convertible preferred stock , payable Jan. 2 to stock of record Dec. 8 .
wsj_2062	1	But directors of the Great Neck , N.Y. , real estate investment trust did n't act on the common stock dividend .
wsj_2062	2	And they wo n't consider such a dividend , the trust added , before results are available for the first quarter of 1990 .
wsj_2062	3	In part , the trust cited the need to retain cash for possible acquisitions .
wsj_2062	4	According to a spokesman , One Liberty will have paid out as dividends the required amount of its taxable income to maintain its legal status as a real estate investment trust .
wsj_2065	0	The Chicago Mercantile Exchange fined and suspended two commodities traders accused of making prearranged trades with each other that allegedly cheated a customer .
wsj_2065	1	Merc officials said Gary N. Roberts was disciplined following the exchange 's investigation of his trading in several commodities pits from July to November 1988 .
wsj_2065	2	The Merc said Mr. Roberts withheld from the market certain orders in cooperation with another trader , David Stein .
wsj_2065	3	The Merc fined Mr. Roberts $ 15,000 and suspended his trading membership for three years .
wsj_2065	4	Also , he and Mr. Stein were ordered to make restitution of $ 35,000 to a customer .
wsj_2065	5	Mr. Stein was fined $ 25,000 and suspended for three years .
wsj_2065	6	Messrs. Roberts and Stein could n't be reached for comment .
wsj_2065	7	The Merc said that as part of the disciplinary settlement , neither man admitted , nor denied the alleged violations .
wsj_2065	8	Neither was among the 46 traders indicted last August in a federal investigation of traders at both the Merc and the Chicago Board of Trade .
wsj_2066	0	In a move that could pose a new competitive challenge to Time Warner Inc. 's powerful Home Box Office , cable giant Tele-Communications Inc. agreed to buy half of Showtime Networks Inc. from Viacom Inc. for $ 225 million .
wsj_2066	1	The purchase comes after nearly three years of on-again off-again talks between TCI and Viacom , which has also discussed the sale of an interest in Showtime with other cable operators .
wsj_2066	2	Showtime is a distant No. 2 to Home Box Office , and in May filed a $ 2.5 billion antitrust suit against Time Warner , charging the company and its HBO and American Television cable units with conspiring to monopolize the pay TV business .
wsj_2066	3	HBO has close to 24 million subscribers to its HBO and Cinemax networks , while Showtime and its sister service , The Movie Channel , have only about 10 million , according to Paul Kagan Associates , a Carmel , Calif. , research firm .
wsj_2066	4	For TCI , the investment in Showtime puts it in an unusual position ; as the largest cable operator , with control of close to 12 million of the nation 's 52 million cable subscribers , TCI is HBO 's largest customer .
wsj_2066	5	But TCI President John Malone has long been concerned about HBO 's dominance of the pay TV business , and has been eager to keep Showtime as a healthy competitor .
wsj_2066	6	`` It is important to the cable industry that we have a vibrant and competitive pay-television marketplace , '' Mr. Malone said in a statement .
wsj_2066	7	In a telephone interview , Robert Thomson , TCI senior vice president , said Showtime 's suit against HBO `` does n't involve us , and nothing we 're doing here bears any relationship to that . ''
wsj_2066	8	He added , `` We do n't intend to be drawn into it , '' noting that TCI wo n't play any active role in the management of Showtime .
wsj_2066	9	Linking up Showtime with the largest cable operator in the U.S. could sharply boost its subscribers .
wsj_2066	10	TCI said it may bring in other cable operators as investors , a practice it has employed in the past with investments in other cable networks , such as The Discovery Channel .
wsj_2066	11	Additional cable partners could boost subscribers even further .
wsj_2066	12	Time Warner declined comment .
wsj_2066	13	In addition to owning HBO , Time Warner owns American Television & Communications Inc. , the nation 's second largest cable operator after TCI .
wsj_2066	14	Viacom also owns cable systems , but it is the 14th largest operator of such systems , with less than one million subscribers .
wsj_2066	15	The TCI investment is a big victory for Viacom 's chief executive officer , Frank Biondi , and Winston H. Cox , president of the Showtime unit .
wsj_2066	16	`` This takes any question of Showtime 's viability and puts it away once and for all , '' Mr. Biondi said in a telephone interview .
wsj_2066	17	The fight between HBO and Showtime is particularly acrimonious because Mr. Biondi is the former chief executive of HBO , and Mr. Cox served as chief of marketing for the service .
wsj_2066	18	They were both hired by Sumner Redstone , the Boston billionaire who took control of Viacom three years ago in a leveraged buy-out .
wsj_2066	19	Time Warner has vigorously denied all of Viacom 's allegations .
wsj_2067	0	Boeing Co. , already struck by its Machinists union , briefly called off contract talks with its engineers and labeled their demands `` grossly excessive . ''
wsj_2067	1	Later , however , the company agreed to meet on Monday with the Seattle Professional Engineering Employees Association after a federal mediator intervened , according to the union .
wsj_2067	2	A spokesman for the engineers said the company asked the union to reduce its demands , which included a 19 % pay hike in the first year and 8 % in the second and third years .
wsj_2067	3	The union represents about 28,000 engineers and technical workers .
wsj_2067	4	Its contract expires Dec. 1 .
wsj_2067	5	Meanwhile , a federal mediator is scheduled to meet today with Boeing officials and representatives of 55,000 striking Machinists .
wsj_2067	6	`` It will take several meetings to resolve this , '' said a spokesman for the Machinists union .
wsj_2067	7	`` We do n't want to bring back something the members will reject . ''
wsj_2067	8	Machinists already have rejected a package that would have provided a 10 % pay raise plus bonuses over the three-year life of the contract .
wsj_2067	9	It also would have reduced mandatory overtime .
wsj_2068	0	Investor Asher Edelman increased his stake in Intelogic Trace Inc. and cleared the way for additional purchases .
wsj_2068	1	It was n't clear , however , whether the actions were related to a battle between the corporate raider and New York attorney Martin Ackerman for control of Datapoint Corp. , a San Antonio , Texas-based data-processing systems maker .
wsj_2068	2	Intelogic Trace , a computer services company , was spun off to Datapoint holders in 1985 , after Mr. Edelman gained control .
wsj_2068	3	After Mr. Ackerman announced he was soliciting consents from shareholders in order to wrest control of Datapoint from Mr. Edelman , the corporate raider purchased 30 % of Datapoint 's shares .
wsj_2068	4	In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing , Mr. Edelman said from Sept. 29 to Oct. 13 , he acquired 309,500 shares of Intelogic common shares for $ 2.25 to $ 2.375 each .
wsj_2068	5	The purchases increased his stake to 16.2 % of the shares outstanding .
wsj_2068	6	The filing also said certain provisions which apply to persons acquiring 20 % or more of Intelogic common stock , were waived by Intelogic for Mr. Edelman , who is chairman of the company .
wsj_2068	7	Mr. Edelman could n't be reached for comment .
wsj_2070	0	An unexpectedly sharp widening in the U.S. trade gap for August dragged the dollar lower Tuesday , but profit-taking on short positions helped the currency rebound to close mixed against major counterparts .
wsj_2070	1	While the market kept careful tabs on Wall Street 's gyrations , it shrugged off a modest downturn in equities to bid the dollar well above the day 's lows .
wsj_2070	2	Soon after the release of the U.S. trade figures , the dollar plunged to an intraday low of 140.95 yen .
wsj_2070	3	It also declined against the mark but did n't reach its intraday low of 1.8435 marks until two hours later .
wsj_2070	4	The unit stabilized about midday New York time at around 1.85 marks and 141 yen , prompting unconfirmed rumors that the U.S. Federal Reserve had intervened to blunt the unit 's tumble .
wsj_2070	5	The dollar finished at its intraday highs .
wsj_2070	6	Dealers noted that the foreign exchange market 's initial bearish reaction to the U.S. trade figures was tempered later by a `` calmer reassessment of the data . ''
wsj_2070	7	The U.S. Commerce Department reported a $ 10.77 billion deficit in August , compared with a revised July deficit of $ 8.24 billion .
wsj_2070	8	Economists had expected a $ 9.1 billion gap .
wsj_2070	9	The August figure reflected a 6.4 % rise in imports and a 0.2 % drop in exports .
wsj_2070	10	Marc M. Goloven , an economist with Manufacturers Hanover Trust in New York , said that while the figures appear to indicate a sadly deteriorating U.S. trade performance , there 's still enough positive news in the data to justify buying dollars .
wsj_2070	11	He said that while the U.S. trade gap with Canada has widened significantly , the trade deficit with Western Europe and Japan continues to narrow .
wsj_2070	12	And he added that manufactured goods exports are still rising .
wsj_2070	13	The dollar 's near-term path remains foggy , according to currencny analysts , who characterize the market as `` bewildering . ''
wsj_2070	14	In late New York trading yesterday , the dollar was quoted at 1.8667 marks , down from 1.8685 marks late Monday , and at 142.75 yen , up from 141.85 yen late Monday .

wsj_2070	16	In Tokyo Wednesday , the U.S. currency opened for trading at 142.55 yen , unchanged from Tuesday 's Tokyo close .
wsj_2070	17	Later , the U.S. currency fell to about 142.25 yen on news reports of the San Francisco earthquake .
wsj_2070	18	Some analysts remain bullish and point out that the dollar continues to be well bid despite key rate increases in Europe and Japan , several weeks of aggressive dollar sales by the world central banks -- some traders estimate that the barrage of sales topped $ 12 billion -- and a 190-point plunge on the New York Stock Exchange .
wsj_2070	19	They note that the U.S. unit is trading at the upper end of the presumed target zones established by the Group of Seven trading partners .

wsj_2070	22	They say that the recent injection of liquidity into the U.S. banking system has been modest , and they do n't anticipate significant easing by the U.S. Federal Reserve .
wsj_2070	23	The Fed arranged $ 1.5 billion of customer repurchase agreements Tuesday , the second repurchase agreement in two days .
wsj_2070	24	The move , which injects capital into the system , is seen as an effort to reassure the finanicial markets that the U.S. central bank is ready to provide the ample liquidity .
wsj_2070	25	But other analysts contend that while the Fed 's move to loosen credit has n't been aggressive , it nevertheless sends a clear signal that , at least for now , the Fed has relaxed its grip on credit .
wsj_2070	26	They add that the Fed has allowed the key federal funds interest rate to dip to about 8 5/8 % from its levels of just below 9 % last week .
wsj_2070	27	The federal funds rate is the overnight lending rate that banks charge each other .
wsj_2070	28	Market participants said that the mark continues to post the most significant gains against the dollar .

wsj_2071	0	National Semiconductor Corp. said it settled a four-year-old patent infringement case against Linear Technology Corp. by accepting a $ 3 million payment from Linear in exchange for granting Linear irrevocable licenses for all products involved .
wsj_2071	1	The two companies also agreed to settle any future property rights issues over the next 10 years through binding arbitration , both companies said .
wsj_2071	2	The products are so-called analog integrated circuits that have applications in the consumer electronics , automobile and electronic instrumentation markets .
wsj_2071	3	Linear Technology , Milpitas , Calif. , called the settlement `` positive , '' since products covered by the disputed patents account for about 20 % of its annual sales .
wsj_2071	4	The electronics concern said it already has paid $ 2 million of the settlement to National Semiconductor , Santa Clara , Calif. , and will pay the remaining $ 1 million in equal installments over the next eight quarters .
wsj_2071	5	The payments are n't expected to have an impact on coming operating results , Linear added .

wsj_2073	2	Houston-based Maryland Club Foods , which had sales of about $ 200 million last year , sells coffee under the Maryland Club and Butter-Nut brands to restaurants , hotels , offices and airlines .
wsj_2073	3	The acquisition `` gives us additional production capacity for the food service coffee business and a stronger distribution network , '' a P&G spokesman said .
wsj_2073	4	P&G already sells its Folgers ground roast coffee to food service concerns , but not to as many markets as Maryland Club .
wsj_2073	5	For example , P&G up until now has n't sold coffee to airlines and does only limited business with hotels and large restaurant chains .

wsj_2075	0	President Bush will veto a bill funding the Departments of Labor , Education and Health and Human Services because it would allow federal funding of abortions for victims of rape and incest , the White House said .
wsj_2075	1	Mr. Bush had threatened a veto previously .
wsj_2075	2	But he put off a firm decision while his aides and legislators searched for a compromise that would tighten requirements for such abortions in a way acceptable to the president .
wsj_2075	3	White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said negotiations between Bush aides and lawmakers ended Monday without success .
wsj_2075	4	Most lawmakers think it will be extremely difficult for Mr. Bush 's opponents on the abortion issue to round up the votes needed to override the veto .
wsj_2075	5	But there still may be prolonged debate and political maneuvering that holds up the $ 156.7 billion funding bill for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1 .
wsj_2075	6	Mr. Bush has said he personally approves of abortions in the cases of rape , incest and danger to the life of the mother .
wsj_2075	7	But he has opposed Medicaid funding of abortions for poor women who say they are victims of rape and incest , arguing that those exceptions are enforced so loosely that they open the way for abortions for other women .

wsj_2077	0	J.P. Morgan & Co. , New York , will help the statutory managers of DFC New Zealand Ltd. to evaluate the failed investment bank 's condition .
wsj_2077	1	Earlier this month , the Reserve Bank of New Zealand , the country 's central bank , appointed the managers to run the investment bank and pay creditors .
wsj_2077	2	DFC asked the central bank to appoint managers after it revised loan-loss provisions to around the same level of shareholders ' funds of 180 million New Zealand dollars US$ 105.4 million .

wsj_2078	0	An experimental vaccine can alter the immune response of people infected with the AIDS virus , a prominent U.S. scientist said .
wsj_2078	1	However , that does n't mean they can benefit from the vaccine .
wsj_2078	2	Its effectiveness ca n't be determined until a large clinical trial is undertaken by the Army in January , according to Robert Redfield , chief of acquired immune deficiency syndrome research at Walter Reed Army Institute of Research .
wsj_2078	3	Dr. Redfield 's report on early experiments using an AIDS vaccine made by MicroGeneSys Inc. of West Haven , Conn. , came at a meeting of AIDS vaccine researchers in Florida late Monday .
wsj_2078	4	The vaccine , VaxSyn HIV-1 , has been safely given to 14 people , some of whom are experiencing substantial increases in certain antibodies .
wsj_2078	5	`` The conventional wisdom used to be that you could n't modify the immune response of an infected individual '' by innoculating them with synthetic viral proteins , Dr. Redfield said .
wsj_2078	6	`` We 've demonstrated that you can . ''
wsj_2078	7	He said certain volunteers developed kinds of antibodies associated with early AIDS .
wsj_2078	8	Other antibodies sparked by the preparation are of a sort rarely present in large quantities in infected or ill individuals , he added .
wsj_2078	9	One of the mysteries of AIDS remains why infected people produce large quantities of antibodies , but deteriorate nonetheless .
wsj_2079	0	Cross & Trecker Corp. said it reached an agreement to sell its Wiedemann division to recently created Murata Wiedemann Inc. , a U.S. affiliate of Murata Machinery Ltd. of Kyoto , Japan .

wsj_2081	2	Operating profit climbed 51 % , to 572 million francs from 378 million in the first half of 1988 .
wsj_2081	3	Matra said the sharp improvement in net profit partly reflected a decline of 59 million francs in the group 's net loss from nonrecurring items in the first half of this year to 104 million francs from 163 million a year earlier .
wsj_2081	4	There was also a decline in the group 's net financial costs to 25 million francs from 50 million a year before .
wsj_2081	5	These movements were offset , however , by a steep rise in corporate income tax payments to 199 million francs from 35 million in the first six months of 1988 .
wsj_2081	6	Matra said the sharp rise in its first-half earnings was based on a 15 % gain in consolidated revenue to 10.16 billion francs from 8.85 billion a year earlier .
wsj_2082	0	Rep. Lee Hamilton D. , Ind . said he and Rep. Byron Dorgan D. , N.D . are backing away from their proposal to make the Treasury Secretary a voting member of the Federal Reserve panel that sets monetary policy .
wsj_2082	1	Rep. Hamilton said the bill will be modified substantially to call for two meetings each year between the Fed 's open market committee and the Treasury Secretary , the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers and the director of the Office of Management and Budget .
wsj_2082	2	The original bill was strongly opposed by the Fed and publicly criticized by friends of the Fed as an attempt to undermine the central bank 's independence .
wsj_2082	3	Fed critics , however , hailed it as a long overdue attempt to bring a measure of openness and democracy to the setting of monetary policy .
wsj_2082	4	Rep. Hamilton said the purpose of the meetings would be to `` improve communications and perhaps coordination between the executive branch and the Fed . ''
wsj_2082	5	Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan meets regularly for lunch with Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and talks frequently with Budget Director Richard Darman and Michael Boskin , chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers .

wsj_2084	1	However , the officials said it was too early to disclose the nature of the proposed projects or indicate when the talks might be concluded .
wsj_2084	2	Daimler-Benz Chairman Edzard Reuter told Milan 's financial daily Il Sole 24 Ore that talks are taking place between both companies ' aerospace units .
wsj_2084	3	`` While Mr. Reuter 's comments please us very much , there currently are no talks in progress regarding the automotive industry , '' a Fiat spokeswoman said .
wsj_2084	4	In the interview , Mr. Reuter said he is thinking foremost of cooperation in the truck sector , but `` in the long run , I do n't want to rule out that we can also come a bit closer in personal cars . ''
wsj_2084	5	Roberto Morelli , Italy analyst for County Natwest Securities in London , said that right now `` the market is n't being influenced by that kind of news , '' referring to the conditional nature of the talks mentioned by Mr. Reuter and by the uncertainty surrounding world stock exchanges this week .

wsj_2086	0	Spooked investors , despite their stampede to dump takeover stocks , should hold on tight to their Jaguar shares .
wsj_2086	1	That 's the view of some analysts here who argue that Britain 's leading maker of luxury cars still may have two U.S. auto giants battling for it .
wsj_2086	2	Yesterday , Ford Motor disclosed that it has raised its holding in Jaguar to 10.4 % from 5 % .
wsj_2086	3	Both Ford and its rival General Motors recently set their sights on grabbing significant minority stakes in the British company .
wsj_2086	4	Ford 's latest move increases the pressure on GM to complete its current talks with Jaguar quickly .
wsj_2086	5	GM is likely to reach the cooperative operating pact it has been seeking in about two weeks , knowledgeable individuals say .
wsj_2086	6	At that point investors may face a long , bumpy ride .
wsj_2086	7	A victor in the fight for Jaguar may not emerge until after the expiration late next year of British government takeover restrictions .
wsj_2086	8	The curbs prevent a buyer from purchasing more than 15 % of Jaguar shares without permission .
wsj_2086	9	`` This is an exceptionally odd takeover battle , '' says London analyst Christopher Will of Shearson Lehman Hutton .
wsj_2086	10	Jaguar 's American depositary receipts were up 3/8 yesterday in a down market , closing at 10 3/8 .
wsj_2086	11	Jaguar 's ADRs make the company one of the most widely held United Kingdom stocks in the U.S. , with more than one-fourth of its shares owned there . )
wsj_2086	12	Jaguar topped the most-active list for the U.S. over-the-counter market Monday .
wsj_2086	13	And on London 's Stock Exchange Monday , 18.5 million shares were traded , far above the usual volume .
wsj_2086	14	Ford 's share purchases undoubtedly accounted for much of Monday 's heavy trading .
wsj_2086	15	Last week , many Jaguar shareholders took their money and ran .
wsj_2086	16	Fears that Ford 's ardor might be cooling put Jaguar shares into reverse after GM confirmed its friendly negotiations with Jaguar .
wsj_2086	17	But yesterday 's announcement indicates that Ford has n't lost interest .
wsj_2086	18	Both Shearson 's Mr . Will and Stephen Reitman , European auto analyst at the London brokerage firm UBS-Phillips & Drew , recently switched their Jaguar recommendations to hold from buy .
wsj_2086	19	`` Sit tight '' through the coming volatility , Mr. Reitman suggests , though he concedes that many small investors will find Jaguar 's zigzags `` too hard to swallow . ''
wsj_2086	20	But a crucial point is how Ford reacts when GM , the world 's largest auto maker , firms up its proposed deal with Jaguar .
wsj_2086	21	At the moment , Ford executives will say little beyond reiterating their desire to raise Ford 's Jaguar stake to about 15 % .
wsj_2086	22	GM is expected to inject roughly # 200 million $ 316 million by acquiring some Jaguar shares , and then win Jaguar management 's promise of an eventual 30 % stake .
wsj_2086	23	Analysts believe the car makers also will create joint ventures to develop new executive models , doubling Jaguar 's yearly output of 50,000 cars .
wsj_2086	24	Jaguar shareholders would have to bless such a far-reaching accord .
wsj_2086	25	Ford might challenge the proposal by offering a full bid if holders and the U.K. government agreed to drop the anti-takeover barrier early .
wsj_2086	26	`` I think Ford is going to come out with full guns blazing , '' Mr. Reitman says .
wsj_2086	27	`` Ford wants Jaguar very much . ''
wsj_2086	28	U.S. takeover-stock speculators , who may own between 20 % and 30 % of Jaguar , could give Ford enough votes to block the GM deal .
wsj_2086	29	Then , Mr . Will says , `` you get a bidding war between two very rich , very determined international companies . ''
wsj_2086	30	He believes Jaguar 's share price could zoom to between # 8 and # 10 $ 12.60 to $ 15.80 .
wsj_2086	31	`` There 's quite a bit of value left in the Jaguar shares here even though they have run up '' lately , says Doug Johnson , a fund manager for Seattle-based Safeco Asset Management .
wsj_2086	32	At the moment , he intends to keep the firm 's 180,000 Jaguar shares .
wsj_2086	33	The risk is that Jaguar 's share price could slump if GM 's agreement with Jaguar effectively locks out its U.S. rival .
wsj_2086	34	`` Ford 's appetite to attack Jaguar could gradually wane over time , particularly if Saab is a reasonably attractive proposition , '' says John Lawson , an auto analyst at London 's Nomura Research Institute .
wsj_2086	35	He thinks Saab-Scania AB on Friday will announce the sale of 50 % of its car division to Ford ; the companies have been discussing closer cooperation for months .
wsj_2086	36	Clifford Stahl , president and chief investment officer of C-S Capital Advisors Inc. , two weeks ago sold his Cincinnati firm 's 107,100 Jaguar ADRs at about 10 each , making a tidy profit on a holding purchased at 4 7/8 in early May .
wsj_2086	37	`` I thought the probabilities of a bidding war happening were less , '' he says .
wsj_2086	38	Of course , that was before Ford 's latest move .

wsj_2091	0	Microsoft Corp. 's earnings growth continued to outstrip that of most of its competitors and customers in the personal-computer industry , as it reported a 36 % jump in fiscal first-quarter earnings on a 33 % revenue gain .

wsj_2091	3	Microsoft previously indicated it would have a strong quarter by forecasting its revenue gain on Oct. 4 , causing a $ 6.50 a share jump in its stock .

wsj_2091	5	Microsoft 's stock rose $ 2.875 a share in national over-the-counter trading to $ 78.625 .
wsj_2091	6	The stock had hit a high of $ 81 a share early last week but collapsed to $ 73.50 in the Friday stock plunge .
wsj_2091	7	The company had been experiencing softening margins because of increased sales of software applications , which have lower margins than do operating systems .
wsj_2091	8	But the company said that trend was offset in the first quarter by better economies of scale and efficiencies in manufacturing .
wsj_2091	9	As a result , Microsoft 's cost of goods , as a percentage of sales , fell 17 % from the year-ago quarter and 13 % from the previous period .
wsj_2091	10	The trend drove up the aftertax margin -- net income as a percentage of revenues -- to 21.1 % in the quarter , compared with 20.7 % a year earlier .
wsj_2091	11	Microsoft officials said the strong results also reflected continuing high demand for its software applications and operating systems .
wsj_2091	12	While it has predicted that overall growth in unit sales of personal computers is slowing to about a 10 % yearly rate , its own products are selling at a much faster rate because many are geared to the high-performance end of the market .
wsj_2091	13	That segment continues to post strong quarter-to-quarter gains , while the low-end , or commodity segment , of the industry is experiencing sluggish growth or even sales declines .
wsj_2091	14	Compared with its previous quarter , the final period of its 1989 fiscal year , net rose 9 % , and sales rose 7 % .

wsj_2095	0	BroadBeach Associates Inc. , the Los Angeles investment partnership whose $ 62-a-share bid for McGill Manufacturing Co. was topped recently by a competing offer from a Swedish concern , disclosed that it sold its entire 7 % McGill stake .
wsj_2095	1	McGill , a Valparaiso , Ind. , ball-bearing manufacturer , had rebuffed BroadBeach 's proposal .
wsj_2095	2	It has since asked holders not to immediately tender their shares under a recent $ 72-a-share , or $ 104 million , bid from AB SKF of Sweden , until McGill directors have completed their evaluation .

wsj_2098	0	Oncor Inc. , Gaithersburg , Md. , said it received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to market a genetic test that will assist in diagnosis and treatment of leukemia and lymph cancer .
wsj_2098	1	The B/T gene rearrangement test is more accurate than existing tests for diagnosing the type of cancer , whether it has spread or whether there is a recurrence following treatment , said Oncor President Stephen Turner .
wsj_2098	2	Mr. Turner said the test initially will be used in conjunction with biopsies and other tests , but eventually might become the benchmark for tumor analysis .
wsj_2098	3	Mr. Turner said the test will be shipped in 45 days to hospitals and clinical laboratories .
wsj_2098	4	Dr. Wyndham Wilson , a cancer treatment specialist at the National Cancer Institute , said the test is widely used in research centers but is n't having a major impact because it is only occasionally useful in choosing the most effective treatment .
wsj_2098	5	But the test may prove to be more sensitive in determining whether a tumor has spread or returned following treatment , Dr. Wilson said .
wsj_2098	6	`` We do n't know yet how useful it 's going to be , '' he said .
wsj_2098	7	Oncor , a six-year-old developer of genetic medical tests , projects that the cancer test will help it to post its first-ever profit during the first quarter of 1990 , Mr. Turner said .
wsj_2098	8	The company will charge $ 35 for a test and projects about $ 2 million in revenue from the test during the first 12 months of marketing , he said .
wsj_2099	0	Unilab Corp. , Norcross , Ga. , said it acquired the clinical laboratories of closely held Central Diagnostic Laboratory Inc. in a cash and securities transaction valued at $ 85 million .
wsj_2099	1	Unilab said its wholly owned MetWest Inc. unit paid $ 25 million in cash , provided $ 30 million in notes and $ 30 million in preferred stock to acquire Central 's labs in the Western U.S. .
wsj_2099	2	Unilab , which provides clinical laboratory services , competed with Central , based in Tarzana , Calif. , in a number of areas .
wsj_2099	3	Beyond removing a competitor , the combination should provide `` synergies , '' said Fred Harlow , Unilab 's chief financial officer .
wsj_2099	4	It also will hand Unilab new markets .
wsj_2099	5	In Los Angeles , for example , Central has had a strong market position while Unilab 's presence has been less prominent , according to Mr. Harlow .

wsj_2104	0	The stock of UAL Corp. continued to be pounded amid signs that British Airways may balk at any hasty reformulation of the aborted $ 6.79 billion buy-out of United Airlines ' parent .
wsj_2104	1	UAL stock plummeted a further $ 24.875 to $ 198 on volume of more than 2.8 million shares in New York Stock Exchange composite trading .
wsj_2104	2	The plunge followed a drop of $ 56.875 Monday , amid indications the takeover may take weeks to be revived .
wsj_2104	3	The stock has fallen $ 87.25 , or 31 % , in the three trading days since announcement of the collapse of the $ 300-a-share takeover jolted the entire stock market into its second-worst plunge ever .
wsj_2104	4	`` This is a total bloodbath '' for takeover-stock traders , one investment banker said .
wsj_2104	5	Los Angeles financier Marvin Davis , who put United in play with a $ 5.4 billion bid two months ago , last night proffered both a ray of hope and an extra element of uncertainty by saying he remains interested in acquiring UAL .
wsj_2104	6	But he dropped his earlier $ 300-a-share back-up bid , saying he must first explore bank financing .
wsj_2104	7	Even as Citicorp and Chase Manhattan Corp. scrambled to line up bank financing for a revised version of the lapsed labor-management bid , British Airways , a 15 % partner in the buying group , indicated it wants to start from scratch .
wsj_2104	8	Its partners are United 's pilots , who were to own 75 % , and UAL management at 10 % .
wsj_2104	9	Adding insult to injury , United 's 25,000-member Machinists ' union , which helped scuttle financing for the first bid , yesterday asked UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf and other UAL directors to resign .
wsj_2104	10	A similar demand was made by a group that represents some of United 's 26,000 noncontract employees .
wsj_2104	11	John Peterpaul , Machinists union general vice president , attacked Mr. Wolf as `` greedy and irresponsible '' for pursuing the buy-out .
wsj_2104	12	Although Mr. Wolf and John Pope , UAL 's chief financial officer , stood to pocket $ 114.3 million for stock and options in the buy-out , UAL executives planned to reinvest only $ 15 million in the new company .
wsj_2104	13	The blue-collar machinists , longtime rivals of the white-collar pilots , say the buyout would load the company with debt and weaken its finances .
wsj_2104	14	Confusion about the two banks ' hurried efforts to round up financing for a new bid that the UAL board has n't even seen yet helped send UAL stock spiraling downward .
wsj_2104	15	And rumors of forced selling by takeover-stock traders triggered a 25-point downdraft in the Dow Jones Industrial Average around 11:15 a.m. EDT yesterday .
wsj_2104	16	Yesterday 's selling began after a Japanese news agency reported that Japanese banks , which balked at the first bid , were ready to reject a revised version at around $ 250 a share , or $ 5.65 billion .
wsj_2104	17	Several reports as the day progressed gave vague or conflicting indications about whether banks would sign up .
wsj_2104	18	Citicorp , for example , said only that it had `` expressions of interest of a transaction from both the borrowers and the banks , '' but did n't have an agreement .
wsj_2104	19	Late in the day , Mr. Wolf issued a onepage statement calling Mr. Peterpaul 's blast `` divisive and uncalled for . ''
wsj_2104	20	But he gave few details on the progress toward a new bid , saying only , `` We are working toward a revised proposal for majority employee ownership . ''
wsj_2104	21	Meanwhile , in another sign that a new bid is n't imminent , it was learned that the UAL board held a telephone meeting Monday to hear an update on the situation , but that a formal board meeting is n't likely to be convened until early next week .
wsj_2104	22	In London , British Airways Chairman Lord King was quoted in the Times as declaring he is `` not prepared to take my shareholders into a hasty deal . ''
wsj_2104	23	Observers said it appeared that British Air was angered at the way the bid has degenerated into confusion , as well as by the banks ' effort to round up financing for what one called `` a deal that is n't a deal . ''
wsj_2104	24	The effort to revive the bid was complicated by the unwieldy nature of the three-party buying group .
wsj_2104	25	The pilots were meeting outside Chicago yesterday .
wsj_2104	26	But British Air , which was to have supplied $ 750 million out of $ 965 million in equity financing , apparently was n't involved in the second proposal and could well reject it even if banks obtain financing .
wsj_2104	27	A group of United 's noncontract employees said in a statement , `` The fact that Wolf and other officers were going to line their pockets with literally millions of dollars while instituting severe pay cuts on the nonunion employees of United is not only deplorable but inexcusable . ''
wsj_2104	28	The machinists also asked for an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission into possible securities-law violations in the original bid for UAL by Mr. Davis , as well as in the response by UAL .
wsj_2104	29	Last week , just before the bank commitments were due , the union asked the U.S. Labor Department to study whether the bid violated legal standards of fairness governing employee investment funds .
wsj_2104	30	In his statement , Mr. Wolf said , `` We continue to believe our approach is sound , and that it is far better for all employees than the alternative of having an outsider own the company with employees paying for it just the same . ''
wsj_2104	31	Mr. Wolf has eschewed merger advice from a major Wall Street securities firm , relying instead only on a takeover lawyer , Peter Atkins of Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom .
wsj_2104	32	The huge drop in UAL stock prompted one takeover stock trader , George Kellner , managing partner of Kellner , DiLeo & Co. , to deny publicly rumors that his firm was going out of business .
wsj_2104	33	Mr. Kellner said that despite losses on UAL stock , his firm 's health is `` excellent . ''
wsj_2104	34	The stock 's decline also has left the UAL board in a quandary .
wsj_2104	35	Although it may not be legally obligated to sell the company if the buy-out group ca n't revive its bid , it may have to explore alternatives if the buyers come back with a bid much lower than the group 's original $ 300-a-share proposal .
wsj_2104	36	At a meeting Sept. 1 to consider the labor-management bid , the board also was informed by its investment adviser , First Boston Corp. , of interest expressed by buy-out funds including Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. and Forstmann Little & Co. , as well as by Robert Bass , Morgan Stanley 's buy-out fund , and Pan Am Corp .
wsj_2104	37	The takeover-stock traders were hoping that Mr. Davis or one of the other interested parties might re-emerge with the situation in disarray , or that the board might consider a recapitalization .
wsj_2104	38	Meanwhile , Japanese bankers said they were still hesitant about accepting Citicorp 's latest proposal .
wsj_2107	0	Honeywell Inc. said it hopes to complete shortly the first of two sales of shares in its Japanese joint venture , Yamatake-Honeywell , for about $ 280 million .
wsj_2107	1	The company would n't disclose the buyer of the initial 16 % stake .
wsj_2107	2	Proceeds of the sale , expected to be completed next week , would be used to repurchase as many as 10 million shares of Honeywell stock , the company said .
wsj_2107	3	Honeywell said it is negotiating the sale of a second stake in Yamatake-Honeywell , but indicated it intends to hold at least 20 % of the joint venture 's stock long term .
wsj_2107	4	A 20 % stake would allow Honeywell to include Yamatake earnings in its results .
wsj_2107	5	Honeywell previously said it intended to reduce its holding in the Japanese concern as part of a restructuring plan which also calls for a reduction of dependence on weapons sales .
wsj_2107	6	Yesterday a spokeswoman said the company was `` pleased with our progress '' in that regard and `` hopes to provide additional details soon . ''
wsj_2107	7	Honeywell said its Defense and Marine Systems group incurred delays in shipping some undisclosed contracts during the third quarter , resulting in lower operating profit for that business .
wsj_2107	8	Overall , Honeywell reported earnings of $ 74.4 million , or $ 1.73 a share , for the three months ended Oct. 1 compared with a loss of $ 41.4 million , or 98 cents a share , a year earlier .
wsj_2107	9	The previous period 's results included a $ 108 million pretax charge related to unrecoverable contract costs and a $ 12.3 million pretax gain on real estate sales .
wsj_2107	10	Sales for the latest quarter were flat , at $ 1.72 billion .
wsj_2107	11	For the nine months , Honeywell reported earnings of $ 212.1 million , or $ 4.92 a share , compared with earnings of $ 47.9 million , or $ 1.13 a share , a year earlier .
wsj_2107	12	Sales declined slightly to $ 5.17 billion .
wsj_2108	0	Once again , your editorial page misstates the law to conform to your almost beatific misperceptions .
wsj_2108	1	In an excursus of little relevance to his central point about private enforcement suits by environmental groups , Michael S. Greve informs your readers , `` ... the Clean Water Act is written upon the presumption -- the pretense , rather -- that nothing but zero risk will do ; it establishes a legal standard of zero discharge '' `` Congress's Environmental Buccaneers , '' Sept. 18 .
wsj_2108	2	This statement surely buttresses your editorial viewpoint that environmental protection is generally silly or excessive , but it is simply wrong .
wsj_2108	3	The Clean Water Act contains no `` legal standard '' of zero discharge .
wsj_2108	4	It requires that `` discharges of pollutants '' into the `` waters of the United States '' be authorized by permits that reflect the effluent limitations developed under section 301 .
wsj_2108	5	Whatever may be the problems with this system , it scarcely reflects `` zero risk '' or `` zero discharge . ''
wsj_2108	6	Perhaps Mr. Greve was confused by Congress 's meaningless statement of `` the national goal '' in section 101 , which indeed calls for the elimination of discharges -- by 1985 , no less .
wsj_2108	7	This fatuous statement was not taken seriously when enacted in 1972 , and should not now be confused with the operative provisions of the statute .
wsj_2108	8	Thus , you do the public a great disservice when Mr. Greve suggests , even facetiously , that the Clean Water Act prohibits the preparation of a scotch and water ; your tippling readers may be led to believe that nothing but chance or oversight protects them , as they cower in the night with their scotch and waters , from the hairyknuckled knock of the Sierra Club at their doors .

wsj_2115	1	CREATIVE ACCOUNTING , mostly by conglomerates , forced CPAs to change their way of setting standards to be followed by corporations reporting financial results , standards that had become all too flexible .
wsj_2115	2	The new Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB was created in 1972 to replace the Accounting Principles Board of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants .
wsj_2115	3	All of the former board 's members were CPAs , provoking conflict-of-interest criticism because they were writing rules while handling clients ' books at the same time .
wsj_2115	4	The new board 's seven-member structure kept four CPAs , but the others were from industry and academia .
wsj_2115	5	Francis M. Wheat , a former Securities and Exchange Commission member , headed the panel that had studied the issues for a year and proposed the FASB on March 30 , 1972 .
wsj_2115	6	The former board had produced `` 21 opinions and 1,000 critics '' in its 12-year life , its chairman had conceded .
wsj_2115	7	The climate was right for the new FASB .
wsj_2115	8	In the late 1960s some CPAs failed to correct such abuses as clients picking permissive rules that hyped earnings and stock prices .
wsj_2115	9	And in November 1970 Congress had passed a special act to overrule one board rule .
wsj_2115	10	Also , James Needham , an SEC commissioner , in April 1972 had warned that the industry might face a `` federal agency writing accounting rules '' if they rejected the FASB idea .
wsj_2115	11	Keepers of the books , dubbed `` figure filberts , '' loathed the threat .
wsj_2115	12	The FASB had its initial meeting on March 28 , 1973 .
wsj_2115	13	On Dec. 13 , 1973 , it issued its first rule ; it required companies to disclose foreign currency translations in U.S. dollars .
wsj_2115	14	The FASB since then has issued 102 rules , and some still rile industry .
wsj_2115	15	Since late 1987 , for example , it has put off a rule dealing with deferred income taxes because of the continuing controversy over the issue .

wsj_2123	7	`` It 's a good indication that level of profitability has peaked for the industry , '' says Vahid Fathi , metals analyst with Prescott , Ball & Turben Inc. , who had estimated Reynolds would earn about $ 2.35 a share .
wsj_2123	8	The nation 's No. 2 aluminum company said earnings were hurt by lower prices for certain fabricated aluminum products , which typically follow price fluctuations of primary ingots .
wsj_2123	9	The base metal price has dropped 30.3 % from a year earlier to 78 cents a pound .
wsj_2123	10	Much of the price decline has been blamed on a slowing economy and the third quarter is typically the industry 's slowest period .

wsj_2126	1	Judge John E. Sprizzo issued the order in Manhattan federal court , where Sony has accused the tiny company of illegally knocking off the `` My First Sony '' line .
wsj_2126	2	The judge held that the combination of colors used for the Sony products is distinctive and subject to protection under New York state law , rather than federal law .
wsj_2126	3	The legal fight was the subject of a Wall Street Journal story yesterday .

wsj_2128	0	A federal appeals court struck down a natural-gas regulation that had prevented pipeline companies from passing to customers part of $ 1 billion in costs from controversial `` take-or-pay '' contracts .
wsj_2128	1	The court , in a 3-0 ruling , threw out a deadline set by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for settling old contract disputes over gas that the pipeline companies reserved but did n't use .
wsj_2128	2	FERC 's regulation had given pipelines until March 31 , 1989 , to pass on to customers as much as 50 % of the costs of buying out their broken contracts , which were made with producers when gas prices were high and supplies short .
wsj_2128	3	A majority of old contracts were renegotiated by the deadline and settled at steep discounts .
wsj_2128	4	But pipeline companies estimate they still face $ 2.4 billion in liabilities from unresolved disputes , including $ 1 billion they fear they wo n't be able to pass on to customers .
wsj_2128	5	According to industry lawyers , the ruling gives pipeline companies an important second chance to resolve remaining disputes and take advantage of the cost-sharing mechanism .
wsj_2128	6	The court left open whether FERC could reimpose a new deadline later .
wsj_2128	7	The court , agreeing with pipeline companies , found the March 31 deadline was `` arbitrary and capricious '' and `` highly prejudicial to the bargaining power of pipelines '' that were forced to negotiate settlement of the old take-or-pay contracts to meet the deadline .
wsj_2128	8	A report last month by the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America found that pipelines ' settlement costs had jumped in the three months before the deadline to 39 cents on the dollar , from 22 cents on the dollar in 1988 .
wsj_2128	9	The court ordered FERC to justify within 60 days not only its cost-sharing deadline , but other major elements of its proposed regulation for introducing more competition into natural-gas transportation .
wsj_2128	10	The court also questioned a crediting mechanism that could be used to resolve take-or-pay liabilities .
wsj_2128	11	The complex regulation , known in the industry as Order 500 , has been hotly contested by all sides , including natural-gas producers , pipelines , local distribution companies and consumers .
wsj_2128	12	The court 's decision would allow FERC to change some of its provisions , but ensures it will be reviewed again quickly by the court .

wsj_2144	1	SOFT CONTACT LENSES WON federal blessing on March 18 , 1971 , and quickly became eye openers for their makers .
wsj_2144	2	The Food and Drug Administration that day said Bausch & Lomb could start selling them in the U.S. .
wsj_2144	3	The cornflake-size product was more comfortable and less prone to falling out than hard contact lenses , which had been around since 1939 .
wsj_2144	4	Bausch & Lomb sold the softies under a sublicense from National Patent Development , which had gained the rights from the Czechoslovakia Academy of Sciences .
wsj_2144	5	Otto Wichterle , a Czech , invented them in 1962 .
wsj_2144	6	The plastic lens wraps itself over the cornea , absorbing eye moisture while permitting oxygen to pass through .
wsj_2144	7	But the new lens became the eye of a storm .
wsj_2144	8	In September 1971 California officials seized `` bootlegged '' lenses -- made by unlicensed companies -- after some showed traces of bacteria .
wsj_2144	9	In October doctors were debating the product 's safety , some claiming it caused infections .

wsj_2144	15	Last month the FDA and Contact Lens Institute cautioned users that serious eye infections could result from wearing lenses more than seven days at a stretch .
wsj_2144	16	Today 20 million of the 25 million Americans using contact lenses are using the soft type .

wsj_2146	0	Bay Financial Corp. , hurt by high debts and deteriorating real estate investments , reported a wider loss for the fourth quarter and said it might be forced to seek a bankruptcy-court reorganization if it ca n't renegotiate its borrowings .
wsj_2146	1	Bay said a `` substantial part '' of its debt outstanding is in default as a result of inability to sell certain properties quickly and lower-than-expected prices for sales made .
wsj_2146	2	The company said its real estate portfolio is `` highly leveraged , '' while about two-thirds of its investments are n't income-producing .
wsj_2146	3	Thus it is coming up short on a big bet that quick sales at higher prices would enable it to keep up with mortgage and other debt payments .
wsj_2146	4	According to its latest annual report , about a quarter of the company 's holdings are in Massachusetts , in the midst of a real-estate slump .
wsj_2146	5	The company said it had a net loss in its fourth quarter ended June 30 of $ 36.2 million , or $ 9.33 a share , on revenue of $ 13.1 million .
wsj_2146	6	A year earlier , the company had a loss of $ 10.8 million , or $ 3.04 a share , on revenue of $ 10.8 million .

wsj_2146	10	Book value per share , which is based on investments at cost , was a negative $ 6.69 a share .

wsj_2148	0	TRW Inc. reported a 12 % decline in third-quarter net income , but the company said that excluding unusual gains in both quarters , operating profit rose 16 % .
wsj_2148	1	The electronics , automotive and aerospace concern said third-quarter net was $ 60 million , or 98 cents a share , down from $ 68 million , or $ 1.11 a share , a year earlier .
wsj_2148	2	Share earnings are reported on a fully diluted basis , by company tradition .
wsj_2148	3	Results for the 1988 quarter included a gain of $ 1.05 a share from sale of the Reda Pump and Oilwell Cable units , partly offset by a charge of 69 cents a share for recall of faulty truck steering systems .
wsj_2148	4	The latest quarter included a gain of 11 cents a share as a partial reversal of the recall charge , because the reserve established last year exceeded the actual recall costs .
wsj_2148	5	Sales for the quarter rose 8.3 % to $ 1.79 billion , from $ 1.65 billion , with all three major product groups reporting gains .
wsj_2148	6	The company said aerospace and defense sales were up 2 % for the quarter to $ 802 million , and operating profit climbed 6 % to $ 61 million , mainly because of improved program performance in spacecraft and advanced-technology contracts .
wsj_2148	7	Automotive sales jumped 16 % to $ 791 million , mainly because of higher sales of air bags and other passenger restraint systems , TRW said .
wsj_2148	8	The group had an operating profit of $ 65 million , against a loss of $ 13 million a year earlier .
wsj_2148	9	However , excluding the year-earlier charge for recall of steering gear , operating profit in the latest quarter declined 14 % , reflecting higher start-up and product development expenses in passenger-restraint systems .
wsj_2148	10	Materials and production costs also rose , TRW said .
wsj_2148	11	The information systems segment had a 44 % jump sales to $ 196 million .
wsj_2148	12	An acquisition accounted for half the sales rise , TRW said .
wsj_2148	13	Operating profit rose threefold to $ 18 million , from $ 6 million .
wsj_2148	14	For the nine months , TRW 's net was $ 199 million , or $ 3.22 a share , down 3 % from $ 205 million , or $ 3.33 a share , a year earlier .

wsj_2150	1	The price was n't disclosed .
wsj_2150	2	The transaction is part of UGI 's continuing program to shed AmeriGas 's industrial gas interests and expand the subsidiary 's propane business .
wsj_2150	3	Since June , AmeriGas has netted more than $ 100 million from industrial gas divestitures and reinvested more than $ 50 million to acquire three propane distributors .

wsj_2152	1	Output in the energy sector , which can vary greatly with swings in the oil market , rose 3.8 % in August from May but was down 7.1 % from a year earlier .
wsj_2152	2	The latest figures compare with July 's 4.5 % month-to-month rise and 11.3 % year-to-year fall .
wsj_2156	0	PepsiCo Inc. 's chairman said he is `` more than comfortable with '' analysts ' estimates that third-quarter earnings rose to at least 98 cents to $ 1 a share from 91 cents the year earlier .
wsj_2156	1	D. Wayne Calloway , also chief executive officer of the company , indicated that he expects analysts to raise their forecasts for 1989 after the company releases its earnings today .
wsj_2156	2	So far , analysts have said they are looking for $ 3.30 to $ 3.35 a share .
wsj_2156	3	After today 's announcement , that range could increase to $ 3.35 to $ 3.40 a share .
wsj_2156	4	The official said he also would be comfortable with that new range .
wsj_2156	5	In 1988 , the soft-drink giant earned $ 2.90 a share .
wsj_2156	6	Results for 1989 will include about 40 cents a share from the dilutive effects of snack-food and bottling company acquisitions .
wsj_2156	7	In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange , the company closed yesterday at $ 57.125 a share , up $ 3.125 .
wsj_2156	8	The company said third-quarter sales are expected to increase 25 % from $ 3.12 billion of last year 's third quarter .
wsj_2156	9	Domestic soft-drink bottler case sales are estimated to have risen only 1 % in the third quarter -- well below the 4 % to 5 % growth of recent years -- but about in line with the rest of the soft-drink industry .
wsj_2156	10	Mr. Calloway blamed the slower volume on rainier weather , a dearth of new products in the industry and -- to a much lesser extent -- pricing .
wsj_2156	11	PepsiCo said its soft-drink prices were about 2 % higher in the quarter .
wsj_2156	12	Mr. Calloway also noted that soft-drink volume rose a hefty 9 % in last year 's third quarter , making the comparison more difficult .
wsj_2156	13	International soft-drink volume was up about 6 % .
wsj_2156	14	Snack-food tonnage increased a strong 7 % in the third quarter , while domestic profit increased in double digits , Mr. Calloway said .
wsj_2156	15	Excluding the British snack-food business acquired in July , snack-food international tonnage jumped 40 % , with sales strong in Spain , Mexico and Brazil .
wsj_2156	16	Total snack-food profit rose 30 % .
wsj_2156	17	Led by Pizza Hut and Taco Bell , restaurant earnings increased about 25 % in the third quarter on a 22 % sales increase .
wsj_2156	18	Same-store sales for Pizza Hut rose about 13 % , while Taco Bell 's increased 22 % , as the chain continues to benefit from its price-value strategy .
wsj_2156	19	Taco Bell has turned around declining customer counts by permanently lowering the price of its tacos .
wsj_2156	20	Same store-sales for Kentucky Fried Chicken , which has struggled with increased competition in the fast-food chicken market and a lack of new products , rose only 1 % .
wsj_2156	21	The operation , which has been slow to respond to consumers ' shifting tastes away from fried foods , has been developing a grilled-chicken product that may be introduced nationally at the end of next year .
wsj_2156	22	The new product has performed well in a market test in Las Vegas , Nev. , Mr. Calloway said .
wsj_2156	23	After a four-year , $ 7.7 billion acquisition binge that brought a major soft-drink company , soda bottlers , a fast-food chain and an overseas snack-food giant to Pepsi , Mr. Calloway said he does n't expect any major acquisition in the next year or so .
wsj_2156	24	But , `` You never can tell , '' he added , `` you have to take advantage of opportunities .
wsj_2157	0	President Bush chose Martin Allday , a longtime friend from Texas , to be chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission .
wsj_2157	1	Mr. Allday would succeed Martha Hesse , who is resigning .
wsj_2157	2	The White House said Ms. Hesse , a Chicago businesswoman who previously held posts at the Energy Department and FERC , is leaving to become a vice president of First Chicago Corp .
wsj_2157	3	Mr. Allday , an attorney in Midland , Texas , has been solicitor at the Interior Department .
wsj_2157	4	He met Mr. Bush in the 1950s , when the president was a young oil man in Midland and Mr. Allday was a lawyer for an oil firm .
wsj_2157	5	The FERC is a five-member commission that regulates billions of dollars of interstate wholesale energy transactions .
wsj_2157	6	Mr. Allday 's appointment is subject to confirmation by the Senate .

wsj_2158	1	The dividend represents the balance of its regular quarterly payout of 10 cents a share , of which half was paid July 17 in a final distribution prior to its merger with B.B. Real Estate Investment Corp. , also in July .
wsj_2158	2	The company said it hopes to resume its schedule of regular quarterly dividends at the end of this year .
wsj_2159	0	Hydro-Quebec said it notified Central Maine Power Co. it will cancel a $ 4 billion contract to supply electricity to the Maine utility .
wsj_2159	1	The provincially owned utility said it is tearing up the deal because `` the contract 's objectives ca n't be fulfilled . ''
wsj_2159	2	Hydro-Quebec said Maine regulators ' refusal to approve the contract earlier this year halted work on transmission lines and stopped negotiations for resale of electricity carried through Maine to other utilities .
wsj_2159	3	`` It would now be physically impossible to begin deliveries in 1992 , '' a Hydro-Quebec official said .
wsj_2159	4	The contract was to run from 1992 to 2020 .
wsj_2159	5	Under the contract Hydro-Quebec was to supply 400 megawatts of power to Central Maine Power starting in 1992 , 600 megawatts starting in 1995 and 900 megawatts starting in
wsj_2159	6	Hydro-Quebec said Maine regulators ' refusal to approve the contract means Central Maine Power has lost its place in line .
wsj_2159	7	`` We wo n't sign any new contracts with deliveries beginning earlier than 2000 , '' the Hydro-Quebec official said .
wsj_2159	8	He said Hydro-Quebec already has some `` customers in mind '' for the power that was to be delivered to Maine .
wsj_2159	9	`` Nothing has happened since we signed the contract to undermine our conviction that Hydro-Quebec was the lowest-cost , most environmentally acceptable choice for meeting a part of our customers ' energy needs through the year 2020 , '' said Central Maine senior vice president Donald F. Kelly .
wsj_2159	10	Central Maine said it is evaluating `` many energy options '' to make up for the lost future power , including new energy generation and management proposals from New England , and possibly new Canadian purchases .
wsj_2160	0	CHICAGO - Options traders were among the big victims of Friday 's plunging stock market , including one small firm that required an emergency $ 50 million bailout .
wsj_2160	1	While Monday 's rebounding markets helped other investors recoup losses , many options customers and professional traders in stock-index options and the options on takeover stocks were left with multimillion-dollar losses , traders here and in New York said .
wsj_2160	2	Options traders were hurt worse than others on Friday because of the highly volatile nature of options , which often rise or fall in value several times the amount of the price change in the individual stock or index of stocks on which they are based .
wsj_2160	3	Thus , options traders Friday were stuck with losses that also were several times larger than those suffered by many stock traders in New York .
wsj_2160	4	Jeffrey Miller of Miller Tabak Hirsch & Co. said that given the high degree of leverage in the options market , it is `` very easy for these guys to get wiped out .
wsj_2160	5	That may just be the nature of these highly leveraged little creatures . ''
wsj_2160	6	An options contract gives the holder the right to buy call or sell put a specific amount of stock , or in this case the value of a stock index , based on a predetermined price within a given time period .
wsj_2160	7	Options traders who , in return for a small fee , or premium , had previously sold put options on stocks or stock indexes were forced on Friday to buy those contracts back at the previously agreed prices , which were substantially above those in the market as it was falling .
wsj_2160	8	They then had no choice in many cases but to sell the contracts at prevailing prices -- in most cases at a substantial loss .
wsj_2160	9	The latest round of losses is likely to be a serious blow to the Chicago Board Options Exchange , which has never fully recovered from the aftershock of Black Monday , when investors fled the market because of huge losses .
wsj_2160	10	Making matters worse was the fact that late Friday afternoon the CBOE halted stock-index options trading in step with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange 's halt in stock-index futures .
wsj_2160	11	But while the Merc reopened a half hour later , the CBOE remained closed , leaving many options traders unable to make trades that might have reduced the losses .
wsj_2160	12	CBOE Chairman Alger `` Duke '' Chapman , said that , unlike the futures market , the options exchange has to open in a rotation that allows each different options series to trade .
wsj_2160	13	Exchange officials reasoned that they would n't have been able to make such a rotation with the time remaining Friday afternoon , and with the stock-index futures on the verge of closing for a second and final time , the CBOE reasoned that its best course was to remain closed .
wsj_2160	14	The damage was so bad at Fossett Corp. , an options trading firm here , that it was forced to transfer its accounts to First Options of Chicago , a unit of Continental Bank Corp. , as a result of options trading losses .
wsj_2160	15	Fosset so far is the only member of a financial exchange to be forced to be taken over by another firm as a result of Friday 's rout .
wsj_2160	16	Fossett still had several million dollars in capital left after Friday 's close of trading , but not enough that regulators , worried about another potential market plunge yesterday , would let it reopen for trading , options exchange officials said .
wsj_2160	17	Thus , in an unprecedented arrangement underscoring the seriousness of the transfer , the CBOE , the American Stock Exchange and the Options Clearing Corp. , as well as the firm 's owner , Stephen Fossett , put up a total of $ 50 million to guarantee the customer positions being transferred to the bank holding company subsidiary in case the market plunged again yesterday .
wsj_2160	18	S. Waite Rawls III , vice chairman of Continental Bank , First Options ' parent company , said the firm took on about 160 accounts formerly held by Fossett , almost all of them belonging to professional floor traders .
wsj_2160	19	`` Steve and his firm were still worth a lot of money , '' Mr. Rawls said .
wsj_2160	20	`` A package of credit support was put together -- including the assets of Steve and his firm . ''
wsj_2160	21	The bailout was cobbled together over the weekend , with officials from the Federal Reserve Board , Securities and Exchange Commission , Comptroller of the Currency and Treasury as well as the options exchanges .
wsj_2160	22	`` It was great to have the luxury of time , '' Mr. Rawls said .
wsj_2160	23	At one point , an options industry official had to talk the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago 's night watchman into giving him the home phone number of Silas Keene , Chicago Fed president .
wsj_2160	24	First Options did n't have to put any money into the bailout .
wsj_2160	25	Yesterday 's rally in the stock , futures and options markets led CBOE and Amex officials to conclude that the $ 50 million in guarantees almost certainly wo n't need to be tapped by First Options .
wsj_2160	26	The Fossett firm had some losses and liquidity problems during the October 1987 crash as well , Mr. Rawls said .
wsj_2160	27	A federal official said that Continental Bank worked with securities and banking regulators over the weekend to fashion the Fossett bailout , but that conditions were n't dictated by those agencies .
wsj_2160	28	`` It was their business decision , '' the official said .
wsj_2160	29	Officials at Options Clearing Corp. , which processes all options trades for U.S. exchanges , said that the $ 50 million guarantee was unprecedented , but was necessary to help insure the integrity of the options markets .
wsj_2160	30	`` It was an extraordinary situation that needed extraordinary steps , '' said Paul Stevens , OCC president and chief operating officer .
wsj_2160	31	Mr. Stevens declined to give the specific contributions to the $ 50 million guarantee from each participant .
wsj_2160	32	But CBOE and Amex officials said that Options Clearing Corp. contributed $ 20 million to the guarantee , the CBOE put up $ 8 million , the Amex added $ 4 million and $ 18 million came from Mr. Fossett 's own assets .
wsj_2160	33	Mr. Fossett could n't be reached to comment .
wsj_2164	0	G. William Ryan , president of Post-Newsweek Stations , was named chief executive officer of the unit of this media company , effective Jan. 1 .
wsj_2164	1	He will succeed Joel Chaseman , who will remain a vice president of the company and continue to represent Post-Newsweek stations in several industry organizations , the company said .
wsj_2166	0	Steven F. Kaplan was named a senior vice president of this graphics equipment company .
wsj_2166	1	He retains his current positions as chief strategic officer of AM International and president of AM Ventures .
wsj_2168	0	After two years of drought , it rained money in the stock-index futures markets yesterday .
wsj_2168	1	As financial markets rebounded , trading volume in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange 's huge Standard & Poor 's 500 stock-index futures pit soared , reaching near-record levels for the first time since October 1987 .
wsj_2168	2	The sudden influx of liquidity enabled several traders to reap six-figure windfalls in a matter of minutes as prices soared , traders said .
wsj_2168	3	`` Guys were minting money in there today , '' said John Legittino , a futures broker for Elders Futures Inc. in Chicago .
wsj_2168	4	The S&P 500 futures contract , which moves in fractions of an index point under normal conditions , jumped two to three points in seconds early yesterday after an initial downturn , then moved strongly higher the rest of the day .
wsj_2168	5	Each index point represents a $ 500 profit for each S&P 500 contract held .
wsj_2168	6	For the first time since the 1987 crash , traders said that they were able to trade several hundred S&P 500 contracts at a time in a highly liquid market .
wsj_2168	7	Many institutions and individual investors have shied away from stock-index futures , blaming them for speeding the stock market crash on Black Monday two years ago .
wsj_2168	8	Since the crash , many futures traders have n't assumed large positions for fear that the S&P 500 market , with much of its customer order flow missing , would dry up if prices turned against them .
wsj_2168	9	More than 400 traders jammed the S&P 500 futures pit to await the opening bell .
wsj_2168	10	Traders were shouting bids and offers a full five minutes before the start of trading at 8:30 am
wsj_2168	11	The contract fell five points at the open to 323.85 , the maximum opening move allowed under safeguards adopted by the Merc to stem a market slide .
wsj_2168	12	But several traders quickly stepped up and bid for contracts , driving prices sharply higher .
wsj_2168	13	The market hovered near Friday 's closing price of 328.85 for about a half hour , moving several index points higher or lower in seconds , then broke higher and did n't look back .
wsj_2168	14	The S&P 500 contract that expires in December closed up a record 15.65 points on volume of nearly 80,000 contracts .
wsj_2168	15	`` Traders five feet from each other were making bids and offers that were a full point apart , '' said one S&P 500 broker .
wsj_2168	16	`` You could buy at the bid and sell at the offer and make a fortune , '' he marveled .
wsj_2168	17	Several of Wall Street 's largest securities firms , including Salomon Brothers Inc. and PaineWebber Inc. , were also large buyers , traders said .
wsj_2168	18	Salomon Brothers was among the largest sellers of stock-index futures last week , traders said .
wsj_2168	19	Brokerage firms as a rule do n't comment on their market activity .
wsj_2168	20	Unlike the week following Black Monday two years ago , individual traders in the S&P 500 pit were also being uncharacteristically circumspect about their one-day profits .
wsj_2168	21	`` With the FBI around here , bragging rights are a thing of the past , '' said one trader , referring to the federal investigation of futures trading that so far has resulted in 46 indictments lodged against individuals on the Merc and the Chicago Board of Trade .
wsj_2170	0	Should you really own stocks ?
wsj_2170	1	That 's a question a lot of people are asking , following the stock market 's stunning display of volatility .
wsj_2170	2	Whipsawed financially and emotionally by Friday 's heartstopping 190-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and yesterday 's 88-point rebound , they 're wondering if an individual has any business being in the market .
wsj_2170	3	The answer , say academic researchers , money managers and investment specialists , is yes -- as long as you approach the stock market as an investor .
wsj_2170	4	But , they say , people should n't try to be traders , who buy and sell in an effort to ride the latest economic trend or catch the next hot stock .
wsj_2170	5	The case for owning stocks over the long-term is compelling .
wsj_2170	6	`` If you look at 75 years worth of investment history -- including the Great Depression and every bear market since -- stocks have outperformed almost everything an individual could have owned by a long shot , '' says Barry Berlin , vice president at First Wachovia Capital Management .
wsj_2170	7	A dollar invested in the stock market in 1926 would have grown to $ 473.29 by the end of last June , according to Laurence Siegel , managing director at Ibbotson Associates Inc .
wsj_2170	8	But a dollar invested in long-term bonds in 1926 would have grown to only $ 16.56 , and a dollar put in Treasury bills would equal a meager $ 9.29 .
wsj_2170	9	The longer the time period , the less risk there is of losing money in the stock market .
wsj_2170	10	Over time , the odds increasingly favor the investor with a diversified portfolio .
wsj_2170	11	For instance , Ken Gregory , a San Francisco money manager , calculates that if an investor holds a basket of stocks that tracks the Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index , the chance of losing money is 3 % to 4 % over a 10-year period , compared with 15 % over three years and 30 % over one year .
wsj_2170	12	`` If you do n't need the money for 10 years , there 's a clear-cut case for sticking to a steady core of stocks , '' Mr. Gregory says .
wsj_2170	13	Stock-market investments also help balance the other assets an individual owns , says John Blankenship Jr. , president of the Institute of Certified Financial Planners .
wsj_2170	14	Stocks have a place in an investors ' portfolio along with real estate , bonds , international securities and cash , he says .
wsj_2170	15	There are some important caveats : Before investing in stocks , individuals should have at least three to six months of living expenses set aside in the bank , most investment advisers say .
wsj_2170	16	Individuals also should focus on building equity in a home , which provides some protection against inflation , as well as a nest-egg that can be cashed in late in life to help cover the cost of retirement living .
wsj_2170	17	People also should n't invest money in stocks that they 'll need in the near future -- for example , for college tuition payments or retirement expenses .
wsj_2170	18	`` You may have to sell your stocks at a time when the market takes a plunge , '' says Mr. Blankenship , a Del Mar , Calif. financial planner .
wsj_2170	19	But once the basics are covered , `` then I would start to invest , even if it 's as little as $ 1,000 , '' says Michael Lipper , president of Lipper Analytical Services Inc .
wsj_2170	20	He says individuals should consider not just stocks , but other long-term investments , such as high-quality bonds .
wsj_2170	21	Despite the strong case for stocks , however , most pros warn that individuals should n't try to profit from short-term developments .
wsj_2170	22	`` It 's very difficult to do , '' says Donald Holt , a market strategist for Wedbush Morgan Securities , a Los Angeles brokerage firm .
wsj_2170	23	`` Our markets move so fast and they are so volatile , there 's no way the average investor can compete with the pros . ''
wsj_2170	24	Individual investors face high transaction costs of moving in and out of the market .
wsj_2170	25	The cost of executing stock orders varies from brokerage to brokerage and with the size of the order , but 2 % of the order 's value is an average , says Stephen Boesel , manager of T. Rowe Price 's Growth and Income mutual fund .
wsj_2170	26	And assuming their first investment is successful , investors will have to pay taxes on their gains .
wsj_2170	27	That can reduce returns by a third or more , once local taxes are included , Mr. Lipper says .
wsj_2170	28	After that , individual traders face the risk that the new investment they choose wo n't perform well -- so their trading costs could be sustained for nothing .
wsj_2170	29	`` It 's very tough for most individuals to out-trade the mutual funds or the market , '' says Mr. Lipper .
wsj_2170	30	`` You should really think twice if you think you can out-smart the system . ''
wsj_2170	31	Then , too , many individual investors lack the sturdy emotional makeup professionals say is needed to plunge in and out of the market .
wsj_2170	32	So what 's the best way to buy stocks ?
wsj_2170	33	`` Unless an individual has a minimum of between $ 50,000 and $ 100,000 to invest in stocks , he 's still better off in mutual funds than in individual stocks , in terms of getting enough attention from a competent broker , '' says Mr. Lipper .
wsj_2170	34	Still , he adds , `` I could see owning both , given that individuals often have an advantage over big investors in spotting special situations based on their own insights , '' he adds .
wsj_2170	35	George Douglas , first vice president at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. , says that individuals have a particular edge now in `` small to medium-size niche companies with exciting earnings prospects '' -- a traditional stomping ground for small investors .
wsj_2170	36	This growth sector , which usually carries a price/earnings multiple about twice that of the Standard & Poor 's 500 , happens to include some of the market 's most attractive bargains right now .
wsj_2170	37	`` It 's now selling at a multiple about even with the market , '' says Mr. Douglas .
wsj_2170	38	Moreover , Mr. Douglas sees a revival of institutional interest in smaller growth stocks that could boost the performance of these stocks in the medium term .
wsj_2170	39	Many big Wall Street brokerage firms who eliminated their research effort in stocks of emerging growth companies a few years ago are now resuming coverage of this area , he notes .
wsj_2170	40	`` We 're seeing a real turnaround in interest in small growth stocks , '' he says .
wsj_2170	41	The pros strenuously advise individuals to stay away from the latest investment fad .
wsj_2170	42	They say that 's especially important this late in the growth phase of the economic cycle , when there 's no robust bull market to bail investors out of their mistakes .
wsj_2170	43	Friday 's correction presents `` a pretty good buying opportunity , but let 's not speculate at this point in the business cycle , '' says Carmine Grigoli , chief equity portfolio strategist at First Boston Corp .
wsj_2170	44	`` Buy stocks on weakness for their long-term fundamentals , '' he says .
wsj_2170	45	In the long run , investment advisers say , most investors will be better off using the dollar-cost averaging method of buying stocks .
wsj_2170	46	In this method , a person invests a regular amount every month or quarter into the stock market whether the market is up or down .

wsj_2200	0	Influential members of the House Ways and Means Committee introduced legislation that would restrict how the new savings-and-loan bailout agency can raise capital , creating another potential obstacle to the government 's sale of sick thrifts .
wsj_2200	1	The bill , whose backers include Chairman Dan Rostenkowski D. , Ill. , would prevent the Resolution Trust Corp. from raising temporary working capital by having an RTC-owned bank or thrift issue debt that would n't be counted on the federal budget .
wsj_2200	2	The bill intends to restrict the RTC to Treasury borrowings only , unless the agency receives specific congressional authorization .
wsj_2200	3	`` Such agency ` self-help ' borrowing is unauthorized and expensive , far more expensive than direct Treasury borrowing , '' said Rep. Fortney Stark D. , Calif. , the bill 's chief sponsor .
wsj_2200	4	The complex financing plan in the S&L bailout law includes raising $ 30 billion from debt issued by the newly created RTC .
wsj_2200	5	This financing system was created in the new law in order to keep the bailout spending from swelling the budget deficit .
wsj_2200	6	Another $ 20 billion would be raised through Treasury bonds , which pay lower interest rates .
wsj_2200	7	But the RTC also requires `` working '' capital to maintain the bad assets of thrifts that are sold , until the assets can be sold separately .
wsj_2200	8	That debt would be paid off as the assets are sold , leaving the total spending for the bailout at $ 50 billion , or $ 166 billion including interest over 10 years .
wsj_2200	9	`` It 's a problem that clearly has to be resolved , '' said David Cooke , executive director of the RTC .
wsj_2200	10	The agency has already spent roughly $ 19 billion selling 34 insolvent S&Ls , and it is likely to sell or merge 600 by the time the bailout concludes .
wsj_2200	11	Absent other working capital , he said , the RTC would be forced to delay other thrift resolutions until cash could be raised by selling the bad assets .
wsj_2200	12	`` We would have to wait until we have collected on those assets before we can move forward , '' he said .
wsj_2200	13	The complicated language in the huge new law has muddied the fight .
wsj_2200	14	The law does allow the RTC to borrow from the Treasury up to $ 5 billion at any time .
wsj_2200	15	Moreover , it says the RTC 's total obligations may not exceed $ 50 billion , but that figure is derived after including notes and other debt , and subtracting from it the market value of the assets the RTC holds .
wsj_2200	16	But Congress did n't anticipate or intend more public debt , say opponents of the RTC 's working-capital plan , and Rep. Charles Schumer D. , N.Y . said the RTC Oversight Board has been remiss in not keeping Congress informed .
wsj_2200	17	`` That secrecy leads to a proposal like the one from Ways and Means , which seems to me sort of draconian , '' he said .
wsj_2200	18	`` The RTC is going to have to pay a price of prior consultation on the Hill if they want that kind of flexibility . ''
wsj_2200	19	The Ways and Means Committee will hold a hearing on the bill next Tuesday .
wsj_2203	0	NCR Corp. reported a 10 % drop in third-quarter net income , citing intense competition that caused its gross profit margins to dip .
wsj_2203	1	Net income for the quarter fell to $ 93.1 million from $ 103.1 million , roughly what analysts had expected .
wsj_2203	2	But per-share profit dropped only 2 % to $ 1.23 a share from $ 1.26 a share , as the company continued its stock buy-back plan .
wsj_2203	3	Average shares outstanding dropped to 75.8 million from 82.1 million .
wsj_2203	4	Revenue fell 1 % to $ 1.39 billion from $ 1.41 billion .
wsj_2203	5	The computer maker , which sells more than half its goods outside the U.S. , also said the negative effect of a stronger U.S. dollar will `` adversely affect '' its fourth-quarter performance and `` make it difficult '' to better 1988 results .
wsj_2203	6	NCR said revenue declined both in the U.S. and overseas , reflecting a world-wide softening of the computer markets .
wsj_2203	7	The company , however , said orders in the U.S. showed `` good gains '' during the latest quarter .
wsj_2203	8	Analysts estimate those gains at 12 % to 13 % , a good part of it coming from large orders placed by a few of NCR 's major customers .
wsj_2203	9	In addition to a general slowing of the computer industry , NCR , which sells automated teller machines and computerized cash registers , is also affected by the retail and financial sectors , `` areas of the economy that have generally not been robust , '' notes Sanjiv G. Hingorani , an analyst for Salomon Brothers Inc .
wsj_2203	10	These factors , combined with a strong dollar , should negatively affect the current quarter 's results , NCR said .
wsj_2203	11	In the year-earlier fourth quarter , NCR had profit of $ 149.6 million , or $ 1.85 a share , on revenue of $ 1.8 billion .
wsj_2203	12	Mr. Hingorani said he lowered his full-year estimates for 1989 to $ 5.35 a share from $ 5.50 a share .
wsj_2203	13	Revenue projections were slashed to $ 6.03 billion from $ 6.20 billion .
wsj_2203	14	Last year , NCR had net income of $ 439.3 million , or $ 5.33 a share , on $ 5.99 billion in revenue .
wsj_2203	15	For the nine months , the company 's earnings fell 9 % to $ 264.6 million , or $ 3.40 a share , from $ 289.7 million , or $ 3.49 a share .
wsj_2203	16	Revenues declined 1 % to $ 4.17 billion from $ 4.19 billion .
wsj_2203	17	In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , NCR shares fell 75 cents to close at $ 57 .
wsj_2204	0	Concerning your Sept. 19 article `` Wall Street Firms Link Analysts ' Pay to Performance , '' I 'm delighted that Wall Street is finally tuning in to the hard , cold facts of the real working world .
wsj_2204	1	If the firms are serious , however , why limit the practice to the poor , maligned analysts whose ability to see into the future is fragile at best ?
wsj_2204	2	Why not extend the same harsh standards to the sales force , and pay brokers a base salary with annual bonus based on how much money they made for their clients during the year ?
wsj_2204	3	That should stop a lot of account-churning , and produce a stock market driven only by professional concern , careful thought and good sense .
wsj_2204	4	Now , would n't that be a novelty .

wsj_2205	0	Steve Clark , a Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. trader , reported for work at 5 a.m. , two and a half hours before the usual Monday morning strategy meeting .
wsj_2205	1	At Jefferies & Co. , J. Francis Palamara did n't reach the office until 5:30 a.m. , but then he had been up most of the night at home .
wsj_2205	2	`` I had calls all night long from the States , '' he said .
wsj_2205	3	`` I was woken up every hour -- 1:30 , 2:30 , 3:30 , 4:30 .
wsj_2205	4	People are looking for possible opportunities to buy , but nobody wants to stick their chin out . ''
wsj_2205	5	For many of London 's securities traders , it was a day that started nervously in the small hours .
wsj_2205	6	By lunchtime , the selling was at near-panic fever .
wsj_2205	7	But as the day ended in a frantic Wall Street-inspired rally , the City breathed a sigh of relief .
wsj_2205	8	So it went yesterday in the trading rooms of London 's financial district .
wsj_2205	9	In the wake of Wall Street 's plunge last Friday , the London market was considered especially vulnerable .
wsj_2205	10	And before the opening of trading here yesterday , all eyes were on early trading in Tokyo for a clue as to how widespread the fallout might be .
wsj_2205	11	By the time trading officially got under way at 9 a.m. , the news from Asia was in .
wsj_2205	12	And it left mixed signals for London .
wsj_2205	13	Tokyo stocks closed off a significant but less-than-alarming 1.8 % on thin volume ; Hong Kong stocks declined 6.5 % in orderly trading .
wsj_2205	14	At Jefferies ' trading room on Finsbury Circus , a stately circle at the edge of the financial district , desktop computer screens displayed the London market 's major barometer -- the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index .
wsj_2205	15	Red figures on the screens indicated falling stocks ; blue figures , rising stocks .
wsj_2205	16	Right away , the reds outnumbered the blues , 80 to 20 , as the index opened at 2076.8 , off 157.1 points , or 7 % .
wsj_2205	17	`` I see concern , but I do n't see any panic , '' said Mr. Palamara , a big , good-humored New York native who runs the 15-trader office .
wsj_2205	18	The Jefferies office , a branch of the Los Angeles-based firm , played it conservatively , seeking to avoid risk .
wsj_2205	19	`` This is not the sort of market to have a big position in , '' said David Smith , who heads trading in all non-U.S. stocks .
wsj_2205	20	`` We tend to run a very tight book . ''
wsj_2205	21	Jefferies spent most of its energies in the morning trying to match buyers and sellers , and there were n't many buyers .
wsj_2205	22	`` All the takeover stocks -- Scottish & Newcastle , B.A.T , DRG -- are getting pretty well pasted this morning , '' Mr. Smith said .
wsj_2205	23	Seconds later , a 7,500-share `` sell '' order for Scottish & Newcastle came in .
wsj_2205	24	For the third time in 15 minutes , a trader next to Mr. Smith left the no-smoking area to have a cigarette .
wsj_2205	25	On the screens , only two forlorn blue figures remained , but the index had recovered a few points and was off about 140 .
wsj_2205	26	`` Because Tokyo did n't collapse , let 's pick up a little stock , '' Mr. Smith said .
wsj_2205	27	He targeted 7,500 shares of Reuters and punched a button to call up on his screen other dealers ' price quotes .
wsj_2205	28	The vivid yellow figures showed the best price at 845 pence , $ 13.27 and Mr. Smith 's traders started putting out feelers .
wsj_2205	29	But the market sensed a serious buyer on a day dominated by selling , and the quotes immediately jumped to 850 pence .
wsj_2205	30	`` When I want to buy , they run from you -- they keep changing their prices , '' Mr. Smith said .
wsj_2205	31	`` It 's very frustrating . ''
wsj_2205	32	He temporarily abandoned his search for the Reuters shares .
wsj_2205	33	By this time , it was 4:30 a.m. in New York , and Mr. Smith fielded a call from a New York customer wanting an opinion on the British stock market , which had been having troubles of its own even before Friday 's New York market break .
wsj_2205	34	`` Fundamentally dangerous ... , '' Mr. Smith said , almost in a whisper , `` ... . fundamentally weak ... fairly vulnerable still ... extremely dangerously poised ...
wsj_2205	35	we 're in for a lot of turbulence ... . ''
wsj_2205	36	By midday , the London market was in full retreat .
wsj_2205	37	`` It 's falling like a stone , '' said Danny Linger , a pit trader who was standing outside the London International Financial Futures Exchange .
wsj_2205	38	Only half the usual lunchtime crowd gathered at the tony Corney & Barrow wine bar on Old Broad Street nearby .
wsj_2205	39	Conversation was subdued as most patrons watched the latest market statistics on television .
wsj_2205	40	At 12:49 p.m. , the index hit its low , 2029.7 , off 204.2 points .
wsj_2205	41	`` France opened the limit down , off at least 10 % if you could calculate the index , which you could n't , '' Mr. Clark , the Shearson trader , said early in the afternoon .
wsj_2205	42	`` Spain is down 10 % and suspended , Sweden 's down 8 % , Norway 11 % .
wsj_2205	43	This market has been very badly damaged . ''
wsj_2205	44	As 2:30 p.m. -- Wall Street 's opening time -- neared , Shearson traders and salesmen traded bets on how low the New York market would open .
wsj_2205	45	In the center of the trading floor , chief trader Roger Streeter and two colleagues scrambled for the telephones as soon as the New York market opened -- plummeting more than 60 points in the first few minutes .
wsj_2205	46	They saw an opportunity created by the sell-off .
wsj_2205	47	As Wall Street traders dumped American Depositary Receipts in Jaguar PLC , Mr. Streeter and trader Sam Ruiz bought them to resell in the U.K .
wsj_2205	48	Investors here still expect Ford Motor Co. or General Motors Corp. to bid for Jaguar .
wsj_2205	49	Suddenly , after about 45 minutes , the U.S. markets rallied .
wsj_2205	50	`` The MMI has gone better , '' shouted one trader at about 3:15 London time , as the U.S. Major Markets Index contract suddenly indicated a turnabout .
wsj_2205	51	As Wall Street strengthened , the London trading room went wild .
wsj_2205	52	Traders shouted as their screens posted an ever-narrowing loss on Wall Street .
wsj_2205	53	Then , nine minutes later , Wall Street suddenly rebounded to a gain on the day .
wsj_2205	54	`` Rally ! Rally ! Rally ! '' shouted Shearson trader Andy Rosen , selling more Jaguar shares .
wsj_2205	55	`` This is panic buying ! ''
wsj_2205	56	As the London market rallied , some wondered whether the weekend of worrying and jitters had been worth it .
wsj_2205	57	The London index closed at 2163.4 , its high for the day , off 70.5 , or about 3.3 % .
wsj_2206	0	Ambassador Paul Nitze 's statement Notable & Quotable , Sept. 20 , `` If you have a million people working for you , every bad thing that has one chance in a million of going wrong will go wrong at least once a year , '' is a pretty negative way of looking at things .
wsj_2206	1	Is n't it just as fair to say that if you have a million people working for you , every good thing that has one chance in a million of going right will go right at least once a year ?
wsj_2206	2	Do n't be such a pessimist , Mr. Ambassador .
wsj_2207	0	The House Aviation Subcommittee approved a bill that would give the transportation secretary authority to review and approve leveraged buy-outs of major U.S. airlines .
wsj_2207	1	The collapsed plan to acquire UAL Corp. , parent of United Airlines , spurred quick action on the legislation , introduced Wednesday and approved by the subcommittee on a voice vote yesterday .
wsj_2207	2	The bill is expected to be taken up by the Public Works and Transportation Committee tomorrow , and a floor vote by next week will be urged .
wsj_2207	3	The measure drew criticism from the Bush administration and a parting shot from financier Donald Trump , who yesterday withdrew his takeover bid for AMR Corp. , the parent of American Airlines .
wsj_2207	4	In a letter to subcommittee Chairman James Oberstar D. , Minn. , Mr. Trump criticized the bill as an explicit effort to thwart his bid for AMR , and said it contributed to the collapse of the deal .
wsj_2207	5	Elaine Chao , deputy transportation secretary , also sent a letter to express the administration 's opposition to the bill `` in its present form . ''
wsj_2207	6	Rep. Oberstar brushed off Mr. Trump 's allegations as an `` excuse for his own deal failing . ''
wsj_2207	7	He also said the fact that the other letter had n't come from Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner indicated there is `` wiggle room '' in the administration 's position .
wsj_2207	8	Mr. Oberstar and other committee members repeatedly stressed that the legislation was n't a response to any particular market situation .
wsj_2207	9	But they cited the UAL and AMR examples as reasons to move quickly to enact this legislation .
wsj_2207	10	Aides both in the House and Senate said the withdrawal of the Trump bid for AMR is n't likely to deflate efforts to push the legislation .
wsj_2207	11	`` It 's still on the fast track and we still want to do it , '' said one Senate aide .
wsj_2207	12	The bill is aimed at addressing the concern that an airline might sacrifice costly safety measures to pay off the debt incurred in a leveraged buy-out .
wsj_2207	13	Currently , the transportation secretary does n't have clearly established authority to block mergers , but can take the drastic step of revoking the operating certificate of any carrier the official considers unfit .
wsj_2207	14	Supporters of the legislation view the bill as an effort to add stability and certainty to the airline-acquisition process , and to preserve the safety and fitness of the industry .
wsj_2207	15	In general , the bill would give the Transportation Department a 30-day review period before 15 % or more of the voting stock of a major U.S. air carrier could be acquired .
wsj_2207	16	It also would require the acquiring party to notify the transportation secretary and to provide all information relevant to determining the intent of the acquisition .
wsj_2207	17	The bill would allow the secretary to reject a buy-out if sufficient information has n't been provided , or if the buy-out is likely to weaken the carrier financially , result in a substantial reduction in size of the airline through disposal of assets , or give control to a foreign interest .
wsj_2207	18	If more information is needed , the secretary would have authority to extend the review period 20 days .
wsj_2207	19	All the witnesses , both congressmen and industry experts , expressed support for the bill in order to prevent profiteers from cashing in on airline profits at the expense of safe , cost-effective service .
wsj_2207	20	But several committee members disapproved , some backing Mr. Trump 's claim that the threat of regulation caused the failure of the UAL deal and the stock-market plunge .
wsj_2207	21	One of the major concerns expressed by the dissenters was that large airlines would be prohibited from divesting themselves of smaller entities and producing independent spin-off companies .
wsj_2208	0	In a possible prelude to the resumption of talks between Boeing Co. and striking Machinists union members , a federal mediator said representatives of the two sides will meet with him tomorrow .
wsj_2208	1	`` It could be a long meeting or it could be a short one , '' said Doug Hammond , the mediator , who called the agreement to meet a first step toward a resumption of negotiations .
wsj_2208	2	`` We 're encouraged that talks are scheduled again but beyond that , we have made no expression of expectations , '' a Boeing spokesman said .
wsj_2208	3	The Machinists union has rejected a three-year contract offer that would have provided a 10 % wage increase over the life of the pact , plus some bonuses .
wsj_2208	4	Currently , average pay for machinists is $ 13.39 an hour , Boeing said .
wsj_2208	5	Now in its 13th day , the strike has idled about 55,000 machinists and has started to delay delivery of some jetliners .
wsj_2208	6	With a strike fund of about $ 100 million , the union had said it was prepared for a long strike .
wsj_2208	7	After the third week on strike , union members will begin receiving $ 100 a week from the fund .
wsj_2208	8	Work at Boeing continues with supervisors and other non-striking personnel manning the lines .
wsj_2208	9	And at the company 's Wichita , Kan. , plant , about 2,400 of the 11,700 machinists still are working , Boeing said .
wsj_2208	10	Under Kansas right-to-work laws , contracts can not require workers to be union members .
wsj_2208	11	Boeing has declined to say how many employees are working at its giant Renton , Wash. , plant .
wsj_2208	12	Union officials could n't be reached for comment .
wsj_2209	0	DPC Acquisition Partners , a hostile suitor for Dataproducts Corp. , said it intends to launch a tender offer for the computer printer maker 's common stock .
wsj_2209	1	DPC , a group led by the New York investment firm Crescott Inc. , also said it plans to file preliminary materials with the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding a shareholder solicitation to oust Dataproducts ' board .
wsj_2209	2	DPC holds a 7.8 % stake in Dataproducts and made a $ 15-a-share bid for the company in May , but Dataproducts management considered the $ 283.7 million proposal unacceptable .
wsj_2209	3	A DPC spokesman declined to elaborate on the group 's new plan .
wsj_2209	4	In American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , Dataproducts shares jumped 62.5 cents to close at $ 9.375 .
wsj_2209	5	Dataproducts , which had been seeking a buyer for several months , announced a restructuring plan in September and took itself off the auction block .
wsj_2209	6	The company 's restructuring includes plans to split into three sectors , to phase out domestic printer manufacturing operations and to sell its New England subsidiary .
wsj_2209	7	As part of the plan , Dataproducts announced a pact to sell $ 63 million of its real estate holdings to Trizec Properties Inc. , a unit of Canada 's Trizec Corp .
wsj_2209	8	Jack Davis , Dataproducts ' president , chairman and chief executive officer , said the company `` is at a loss to understand DPC 's intentions . ''
wsj_2209	9	He called today 's announcement `` opportunistic and disruptive '' and said the company intends to proceed with its restructuring .
wsj_2212	0	LIN Broadcasting Corp. said it wo n't take a position on a revised tender offer by McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. to buy LIN and has asked for clarification of the offer .
wsj_2212	1	The new offer , which seeks 50.3 % of the cellular and broadcasting concern , is for $ 125 a share for 22 million LIN shares .
wsj_2212	2	McCaw 's revised tender offer would require McCaw to begin an auction process in July 1994 that would buy out remaining holders at a per-share price roughly equivalent to what a third party might then have to pay for all of LIN .
wsj_2212	3	LIN is asking McCaw to clarify its tender offer , which challenges an agreement between BellSouth Corp. and LIN to merge their cellular-telephone businesses .
wsj_2212	4	BellSouth has notified LIN that it would `` shortly respond to the McCaw proposal in as full and effective a manner as is warranted . ''
wsj_2212	5	The LIN board said holders may be misled by the provision in the McCaw proposal that `` guarantees '' private market value after five years for the remaining shares .
wsj_2212	6	McCaw has `` no obligation to purchase and the definition of private market value is uncertain , '' the LIN board said .
wsj_2212	7	The board added that McCaw would be able to control LIN 's operations and could , `` therefore , operate LIN in a manner which could diminish its private market value and attractiveness to a third-party purchaser in five years . ''
wsj_2212	8	In national over-the-counter trading , LIN closed at $ 104.75 , down $ 2.75 .
wsj_2213	0	A group of institutional investors in Telerate Inc. said that Dow Jones & Co. 's $ 18-a-share offer for the electronic financial information services company is `` grossly inadequate . ''
wsj_2213	1	In a letter filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission , the group , which holds about 4.5 million Telerate shares , or about 4.7 % of the shares outstanding , said `` ... at present none of us believes an offer for less than $ 25 per share would be fair and some believe that $ 25 is too low . ''
wsj_2213	2	The letter was dated Oct. 6 .
wsj_2213	3	In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange , Telerate shares closed yesterday at $ 18.875 , down 75 cents a share .
wsj_2213	4	Dow Jones , publisher of The Wall Street Journal , has launched an $ 18-a-share , or $ 576 million , tender offer to acquire the remaining Telerate shares outstanding ; Dow Jones owns 67 % of Telerate .
wsj_2213	5	Telerate has rejected the offer , which expires Nov. 3 .
wsj_2213	6	The group includes Putnam Cos. and various affiliates based in Boston ; Wells Fargo Bank , San Francisco ; the California Public Employees Retirement System , Sacramento , Calif. , and T. Rowe Price Associates Inc. , Baltimore .
wsj_2213	7	Among other issues , the group 's letter said it has `` concerns as to whether Dow Jones 's offer meets the applicable requirements of procedural fairness . ''
wsj_2213	8	A spokesman for Dow Jones said he had n't seen the group 's filing , but added , `` obviously Dow Jones disagrees with their conclusions .
wsj_2213	9	Our offer is to buy any and all shares tendered at $ 18 a share .
wsj_2214	0	U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills said the first dispute-settlement panel set up under the U.S.-Canadian `` free trade '' agreement has ruled that Canada 's restrictions on exports of Pacific salmon and herring violate the accord .
wsj_2214	1	Mrs. Hills said the U.S. and Canada have until Nov. 13 to resolve the dispute .
wsj_2214	2	If a solution is n't reached by then , she said , the U.S. would have the right to suspend some trade concessions to Canada equivalent in value to the losses suffered by U.S. fish-processing companies in Alaska and the Pacific Northwest .
wsj_2214	3	However , in Ottawa , Canadian Trade Minister John Crosbie said the dispute-settlement panel accepted the `` legitimacy of Canada 's position on the use of these landing requirements to conserve and manage these important fisheries . ''
wsj_2214	4	Questioned about the seeming contradiction in the U.S. and Canadian government views of the panel 's report , an aide for Mrs. Hills said the panel had clearly ruled that the Canadian trade restrictions `` are illegal . ''
wsj_2214	5	The U.S. trade representative declined to put a dollar estimate on the losses resulting from the Canadian export restrictions .
wsj_2214	6	Canada initially had an export prohibition that was replaced by regulations requiring that such fish had to be brought ashore in British Columbia by commercial fishermen prior to export .
wsj_2214	7	This action was defended by the Canadian government on conservation grounds .
wsj_2214	8	Mrs. Hills said yesterday that the dispute-settlement panel rejected this Canadian government argument .

wsj_2252	2	A spokesman for Gatoil said that the Swiss oil concern was examining the offer , submitted last Friday , along with two other offers , also submitted last week .
wsj_2252	3	Those two offers were private and the spokesman refused to identify the bidding companies .
wsj_2252	4	The spokesman further said that at least two more offers are expected from other companies within two weeks .

wsj_2253	0	While Friday 's plunging stock market prompted new fears about the economy 's prospects , a little-known indicator that has faithfully foreshadowed the economy 's ups and downs by exceptionally long lead times points to a sustained rise in overall business activity .
wsj_2253	1	The barometer , developed by analysts at Columbia University 's Center for International Business Cycle Research here , reached a record high of 223.0 in August , the latest month available , and the Columbia researchers estimate that it has moved even higher since then .
wsj_2253	2	The latest reading of 223.0 was up from 222.3 in July and 215.3 as recently as March .
wsj_2253	3	The August rise marked the fifth straight monthly gain for the indicator , which uses the 1967 average as a base of 100 .
wsj_2253	4	In contrast , the Commerce Department 's widely followed index of leading indicators , while up in August , has fallen repeatedly since reaching a high early this year .
wsj_2253	5	Its ragged behavior through much of 1989 has prompted some forecasters to anticipate the start of a new recession perhaps before year 's end .
wsj_2253	6	But the far stronger showing of the Columbia index `` makes a recession any time soon highly unlikely , '' says Geoffrey H. Moore , the director of the Columbia facility .
wsj_2253	7	A leading authority on the business cycle , Mr. Moore also is a member of the Business Cycle Dating Group , the panel of private economists that decides for the government when expansions and recessions begin and end .
wsj_2253	8	The group normally convenes only when a change in the economy 's general course seems likely .
wsj_2253	9	`` No meeting is scheduled because the expansion shows no sign of going off the tracks , '' Mr. Moore reports .
wsj_2253	10	Based largely on the recent strength in their index , called the long leading indicator , the Columbia analysts foresee uninterrupted economic growth through the rest of this year and next year as well .
wsj_2253	11	They expect a 2.6 % rise in 1990 in the gross national product , after adjustment for inflation .
wsj_2253	12	Underlying this optimism is the index 's longstanding ability to signal recessions or recoveries , as the case may be , by substantially greater periods than the Commerce Department 's index of leading indicators .
wsj_2253	13	Over the full post-World War II era , the Columbia index , on the average , has entered sustained declines 14 months before the onset of recessions and turned up eight months before recoveries .
wsj_2253	14	The comparable lead times for the Commerce index , whose components include the stock market , are far shorter -- 10 months before recessions and only three months before recoveries .
wsj_2253	15	The Columbia economists also have reconstructed how the long leading index would have behaved , had it existed , in 1929 , before the stock market crash in October that ushered in the Great Depression .
wsj_2253	16	The indicator reached a peak in January 1929 and then fell steadily up to and through the crash .
wsj_2253	17	`` It was an entirely different pattern from what we 're seeing now , '' Mr. Moore says .
wsj_2253	18	A major source of the recent strength in the long leading indicator has been the performance of the Dow Jones corporate bond-price index , which is not a part of the Commerce index .
wsj_2253	19	In August , the bond measure was at its highest monthly average since early 1987 .
wsj_2253	20	It also rose last Friday , while the stock market sagged .
wsj_2253	21	Other components of the long leading indicator include a ratio of prices to unit labor costs in manufacturing industries , the M2 version of the money supply , adjusted for inflation , and the volume of new home-building permits .
wsj_2253	22	Notably absent from the Columbia index is the stock market , which Mr. Moore says `` is simply no longer such a good indicator of the economy 's long-range prospects , though it still is useful for anticipating some short-run twists and turns . ''
wsj_2253	23	As recently as 1975 , the stock market -- as reflected in the Standard & Poor 's index of 500 common stocks -- was rated by the National Bureau of Economic Research as the best of the 12 leading indicators that then made up the Commerce index .
wsj_2253	24	It was assigned a mark of 80 out of a possible 100 , compared with scores ranging as low as 69 for the other components .
wsj_2253	25	The stock market has lost some precursory power , analysts at the Columbia center claim , because of the growing impact of international developments .
wsj_2253	26	`` Stocks have become more sensitive to factors not directly tied to the domestic economy , '' Mr. Moore says , citing the exchange rate for the dollar on currency markets , the foreign-trade balance and inflows of foreign capital .
wsj_2253	27	He also feels that the rise of such computer-based practices as program trading has diminished the stock market 's relevancy to the economic outlook .
wsj_2254	0	BSN S.A. , a leading French food group , said it agreed to acquire Birkel G.m.b . H. , a West German pasta maker .
wsj_2254	1	The value of the acquisition was n't disclosed .
wsj_2254	2	The move is in line with BSN 's strategy of gradually building its share of the European pasta market through external growth .
wsj_2254	3	BSN will initially acquire a 15 % interest in Birkel , a closely held concern .
wsj_2254	4	The French group has an agreement giving it the right to buy all the shares outstanding , and this could be completed within a few months , a BSN spokeswoman said .
wsj_2254	5	The takeover was submitted for approval by the West German cartel office , BSN said .
wsj_2254	6	Birkel is West Germany 's second-biggest producer of pasta , with sales of 250 million marks $ 133.4 million in 1988 .
wsj_2254	7	It has 750 workers at three production units in southwest Germany , and is that nation 's leading producer of pasta sauces .

wsj_2255	6	The rating agency said about $ 85 million in securities was affected .
wsj_2255	7	The downgrades were prompted , Moody 's said , by the continuing turmoil in the junk bond market and the suspension of dividends on CenTrust 's preferred stock .
wsj_2255	8	Moody 's also said it believed the proposed sale of 63 CenTrust branches to Great Western Bank could , if completed , endanger the thrift 's funding and market position .

wsj_2303	3	Mr. Shidler 's company specializes in commercial real-estate investment and claims to have $ 1 billion in assets ; Mr. Simpson is a developer and a former senior executive of L.J. Hooker .
wsj_2303	4	`` The assets are good , but they require more money and management '' than can be provided in L.J. Hooker 's current situation , said Mr. Simpson in an interview . ``
wsj_2303	5	Hooker 's philosophy was to build and sell .
wsj_2303	6	We want to build and hold . ''
wsj_2303	7	L.J. Hooker , based in Atlanta , is operating with protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code .

Altman & Co. , as well as majority positions in Merksamer Jewelers , a Sacramento chain ; Sakowitz Inc. , the Houston-based retailer , and Parisian Inc. , the Southeast department-store chain .
wsj_2303	22	Eventually Mr. Simpson and Mr. Herscu had a falling out over the direction of the company , and Mr. Simpson said he resigned in 1988 .

wsj_2313	2	Kaufman & Broad , a home building company , declined to identify the institutional investors .
wsj_2313	3	The land to be purchased by the joint venture has n't yet received zoning and other approvals required for development , and part of Kaufman & Broad 's job will be to obtain such approvals .
wsj_2313	4	The partnership runs the risk that it may not get the approvals for development , but in return , it can buy land at wholesale rather than retail prices , which can result in sizable savings , said Bruce Karatz , president and chief executive officer of Kaufman & Broad .
wsj_2313	5	`` There are really very few companies that have adequate capital to buy properties in a raw state for cash .
wsj_2313	6	Typically , developers option property , and then once they get the administrative approvals , they buy it , '' said Mr. Karatz , adding that he believes the joint venture is the first of its kind .
wsj_2313	7	`` We usually operate in that conservative manner . ''
wsj_2313	8	By setting up the joint venture , Kaufman & Broad can take the more aggressive approach of buying raw land , while avoiding the negative impacts to its own balance sheet , Mr. Karatz said .
wsj_2313	9	The company is putting up only 10 % of the capital , although it is responsible for providing management , planning and processing services to the joint venture .

wsj_2315	5	The spokesman said the broadcast unit will be disbanded Dec. 1 , and the move wo n't affect RJR 's print , radio and spot-television buying practices .

wsj_2315	7	One employee with the group said RJR moved 11 employees of the group back to New York in September because `` there was supposed to be a future . ''

wsj_2322	1	The seller of photographic products and services said it is considering a number of financing alternatives , including seeking increases in its credit lines .
wsj_2322	2	Traditional declined to estimate the amount of the loss and would n't say if it expects to show a profit for the year .
wsj_2322	3	In the year ended June 30 , 1988 , Traditional reported net income of $ 4.9 million , or $ 1.21 a share .
wsj_2322	4	The company did n't break out its fourth-quarter results .
wsj_2322	5	In the latest nine months net income was $ 4.7 million , or $ 1.31 a share , on revenue of $ 44.3 million .
wsj_2322	6	Separately , the company said it would file a delayed fiscal-year report with the Securities and Exchange Commission `` within approximately 45 days . ''
wsj_2322	7	It said the delay resulted from difficulties in resolving its accounting of a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission .
wsj_2322	8	Under an agreement filed in federal court in August to settle FTC objections to some Traditional sales practices , Traditional said it would establish a $ 250,000 trust fund to provide refunds to certain customers .

wsj_2323	1	A spokesman for Information International said the lawsuit by two units of Morris Communications Corp. seeks restitution of the system 's about $ 3 million purchase price and cancellation of a software license provided by the Morris units to Information International for alleged failure to pay royalties .

wsj_2324	0	Syms Corp. completed the sale of its A. Sulka & Co. subsidiary , a men 's luxury haberdashery , to Luxco Investments .
wsj_2324	1	Terms were n't disclosed .
wsj_2324	2	As Syms 's `` core business of off-price retailing grows , a small subsidiary that is operationally unrelated becomes a difficult distraction , '' said Marcy Syms , president of the parent , in a statement .
wsj_2324	3	A spokeswoman said Sulka operates a total of seven stores in the U.S. and overseas .
wsj_2324	4	Syms operates 25 off-price apparel stores in the U.S. .
wsj_2327	0	Salomon Brothers International Ltd. , a British subsidiary of Salomon Inc. , announced it will issue warrants on shares of Hong Kong Telecommunications Ltd .
wsj_2327	1	The move closely follows a similar offer by Salomon of warrants for shares of Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp .
wsj_2327	2	Under the latest offer , HK$ 62.5 million US$ 8 million of three-year warrants will be issued in London , each giving buyers the right to buy one Hong Kong Telecommunications share at a price to be determined Friday .
wsj_2327	3	The 50 million warrants will be priced at HK$ 1.25 each and are expected to carry a premium to the share price of about 26 % .
wsj_2327	4	In trading on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong , the shares closed Wednesday at HK$ 4.80 each .
wsj_2327	5	At this price , the shares would have to rise above HK$ 6.05 for subscribers to Salomon 's issue to profitably convert their warrants .
wsj_2327	6	While Hong Kong companies have in the past issued warrants on their own shares , Salomon 's warrants are the first here to be issued by a third party .
wsj_2327	7	Salomon will `` cover '' the warrants by buying sufficient shares , or options to purchase shares , to cover its entire position .
wsj_2327	8	Bankers said warrants for Hong Kong stocks are attractive because they give foreign investors , wary of volatility in the colony 's stock market , an opportunity to buy shares without taking too great a risk .
wsj_2327	9	The Hong Kong Telecommunications warrants should be attractive to buyers in Europe , the bankers added , because the group is one of a handful of blue-chip stocks on the Hong Kong market that has international appeal .
wsj_2328	0	Financial Corp. of Santa Barbara filed suit against former stock speculator Ivan F. Boesky and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. , charging they defrauded the thrift by concealing their relationship when persuading it to buy $ 284 million in high-yield , high-risk junk bonds .
wsj_2328	1	In a suit filed in federal court Thursday , the S&L alleged that a `` disproportionate number '' of the bonds it purchased in 1984 declined in value .
wsj_2328	2	Financial Corp. purchased the bonds , the suit alleged , after Mr. Boesky and Drexel negotiated an agreement for Vagabond Hotels to purchase a 51 % stake in the thrift for about $ 34 million .
wsj_2328	3	Vagabond Hotels was controlled by Mr. Boesky , who currently is serving a prison term for securities violations .
wsj_2328	4	Officials at Drexel said they had n't seen the suit and thus could n't comment .
wsj_2328	5	In addition to $ 33 million compensatory damages , the suit seeks $ 100 million in punitive damages .
wsj_2328	6	Also named in the suit is Ivan F. Boesky Corp. and Northview Corp. , the successor company to Vagabonds Hotels .
wsj_2328	7	Northview officials could n't be located .
wsj_2328	8	Financial Corp. said it agreed to buy the bonds after a representative of Ivan F. Boesky Corp. visited it in November 1983 and said Financial Corp. could improve its financial condition by purchasing the bonds .
wsj_2328	9	Shortly before the visit , Mr. Boesky and Drexel representives had met with Financial Corp. officials and had signed a letter of intent to acquire the 51 % stake in the company .
wsj_2328	10	However , the agreement was canceled in June 1984 .
wsj_2328	11	Financial Corp. purchased the bonds in at least 70 different transactions in 1984 and since then has realized $ 11 million in losses on them , the company said .
wsj_2329	0	Ideal Basic Industries Inc. said its directors reached an agreement in principle calling for HOFI North America Inc. to combine its North American cement holdings with Ideal in a transaction that will leave Ideal 's minority shareholders with 12.8 % of the combined company .
wsj_2329	1	HOFI , the North American holding company of Swiss concern Holderbank Financiere Glaris Ltd. , previously proposed combining its 100 % stake in St. Lawrence Cement Inc. and its 60 % stake in Dundee Cement Co. with its 67 % stake in Ideal .
wsj_2329	2	But HOFI 's first offer would have given Ideal 's other shareholders about 10 % of the combined company .
wsj_2329	3	Ideal 's directors rejected that offer , although they said they endorsed the merger proposal .
wsj_2329	4	Under the agreement , HOFI will own 87.2 % of the combined company .
wsj_2329	5	Ideal 's current operations will represent about 39.2 % of the combined company .
wsj_2329	6	The transaction is subject to a definitive agreement and approval by Ideal shareholders .
wsj_2329	7	Ideal said it expects to complete the transaction early next year .
wsj_2331	0	If a hostile predator emerges for Saatchi & Saatchi Co. , co-founders Charles and Maurice Saatchi will lead a management buy-out attempt , an official close to the company said .
wsj_2331	1	Financing for any takeover attempt may be problematic in the wake of Friday 's stock-market sell-off in New York and turmoil in the junk-bond market .
wsj_2331	2	But the beleaguered British advertising and consulting giant , which last week named a new chief executive officer to replace Maurice Saatchi , has been the subject of intense takeover speculation for weeks .
wsj_2331	3	Last week , Saatchi 's largest shareholder , Southeastern Asset Management , said it had been approached by one or more third parties interested in a possible restructuring .
wsj_2331	4	And Carl Spielvogel , chief executive officer of Saatchi 's big Backer Spielvogel Bates advertising unit , said he had offered to lead a management buy-out of the company , but was rebuffed by Charles Saatchi .
wsj_2331	5	Mr. Spielvogel said he would n't launch a hostile bid .
wsj_2331	6	The executive close to Saatchi & Saatchi said that `` if a bidder came up with a ludicrously high offer , a crazy offer which Saatchi knew it could n't beat , it would have no choice but to recommend it to shareholders .
wsj_2331	7	But otherwise it would undoubtedly come back '' with an offer by management .
wsj_2331	8	The executive said any buy-out would be led by the current board , whose chairman is Maurice Saatchi and whose strategic guiding force is believed to be Charles Saatchi .
wsj_2331	9	Mr. Spielvogel is n't part of the board , nor are any of the other heads of Saatchi 's big U.S.-based ad agencies .
wsj_2331	10	The executive did n't name any price , but securities analysts have said Saatchi would fetch upward of $ 1.3 billion .
wsj_2331	11	The executive denied speculation that Saatchi was bringing in the new chief executive officer only to clean up the company financially so that the brothers could lead a buy-back .
wsj_2331	12	That speculation abounded Friday as industry executives analyzed the appointment of the new chief executive , Robert Louis-Dreyfus , who joins Saatchi and becomes a member of its board on Jan. 1 .
wsj_2331	13	Mr. Louis-Dreyfus , formerly chief executive of the pharmaceutical research firm IMS International Inc. , has a reputation as a savvy financial manager , and will be charged largely with repairing Saatchi 's poor financial state .
wsj_2331	14	Asked about the speculation that Mr. Louis-Dreyfus has been hired to pave the way for a buy-out by the brothers , the executive replied , `` That is n't the reason Dreyfus has been brought in .
wsj_2331	15	He was brought in to turn around the company . ''
wsj_2331	16	Separately , several Saatchi agency clients said they believe the company 's management shakeup will have little affect on them .
wsj_2331	17	`` It has n't had any impact on us , nor do we expect it to , '' said a spokeswoman for Miller Brewing Co. , a major client of Backer Spielvogel .
wsj_2331	18	John Lampe , director of advertising at PaineWebber Inc. , a Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising client , said : `` We have no problem with the announcement , because we do n't know what change it 's going to bring about .
wsj_2331	19	We are n't going to change agencies because of a change in London . ''
wsj_2331	20	Executives at Backer Spielvogel client Avis Inc. , as well as at Saatchi client Philips Lighting Co. , also said they saw no effect .
wsj_2331	21	Executives at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. , a Backer Spielvogel client that is reviewing its account , declined comment .
wsj_2331	22	Mr. Spielvogel had said that Prudential-Bache was prepared to finance either a management buy-out and restructuring , or a buy-out of Backer Spielvogel alone , led by him .
wsj_2331	23	California 's Glendale Federal Bank awarded its $ 12 million to $ 15 million account to the Los Angeles office of Omnicom Group 's BBDO agency .
wsj_2331	24	The account was previously handled by Davis , Ball & Colombatto Advertising Inc. , a Los Angeles agency .
wsj_2331	25	Royal Crown Cola Co. has ended its relationship with the Boston office of Hill , Holliday , Connors , Cosmopulos .
wsj_2331	26	The account had billed about $ 6 million in 1988 , according to Leading National Advertisers .
wsj_2331	27	As expected , Young & Rubicam Inc. along with two senior executives and a former employee , pleaded not guilty in federal court in New Haven , Conn. , to conspiracy and racketeering charges .
wsj_2331	28	The government has charged that they bribed Jamaican officials to win the Jamaica Tourist Board ad account in 1981 .
wsj_2331	29	A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney 's office said extradition proceedings are `` just beginning '' for the other two defendants in the case , Eric Anthony Abrahams , former Jamaican tourism minister , and Jamaican businessman Arnold Foote Jr .
wsj_2331	30	The Samsung Group and Bozell Inc. agreed to establish a joint venture advertising agency in South Korea .
wsj_2331	31	Bozell Cheil Corp. , as the new agency will be called , will be based in Seoul and is 70 % owned by Samsung and 30 % owned by Bozell .
wsj_2331	32	Samsung already owns Korea First Advertising Co. , that country 's largest agency .
wsj_2331	33	Bozell joins Backer Spielvogel Bates and Ogilvy Group as U.S. agencies with interests in Korean agencies .
wsj_2332	0	Citing a payment from a supplier and strong sales of certain data-storage products , Maxtor Corp. said earnings and revenue jumped in its second quarter ended Sept. 24 .
wsj_2332	1	The maker of computer-data-storage products said net income rose to $ 4.8 million , or 23 cents a share , from year-earlier net of $ 1.1 million , or five cents a share .
wsj_2332	2	Revenue soared to $ 117 million from $ 81.5 million .
wsj_2332	3	Maxtor said its results were boosted by $ 2 million in payments received from a supplier , for a certain line of products that Maxtor is n't going to sell anymore .
wsj_2332	4	Maxtor said effects from discontinuing the line may have a positive effect on future earnings and revenue .
wsj_2332	5	A spokeswoman would n't elaborate , but the company said the discontinued product has never been a major source of revenue or profit .
wsj_2332	6	Operationally , Maxtor benefited from robust sales of products that store data for high-end personal computers and computer workstations .
wsj_2332	7	In the fiscal first half , net was $ 7 million , or 34 cents a share , up from the year-earlier $ 3.1 million , or 15 cents a share .

wsj_2334	0	Southmark Corp. said that it filed part of its 10-K report with the Securities and Exchange Commission , but that the filing does n't include its audited financial statements and related information .
wsj_2334	1	The real estate and thrift concern , operating under bankruptcy-law proceedings , said it told the SEC it could n't provide financial statements by the end of its first extension `` without unreasonable burden or expense . ''
wsj_2334	2	The company asked for a 15-day extension Sept. 30 , when the financial reports were due .
wsj_2334	3	Southmark said it plans to amend its 10K to provide financial results as soon as its audit is completed .
wsj_2335	0	Alan Seelenfreund , 52 years old , was named chairman of this processor of prescription claims , succeeding Thomas W. Field Jr. , 55 , who resigned last month .
wsj_2335	1	Mr. Field also had been chairman of McKesson Corp. , resigning that post after a dispute with the board over corporate strategy .
wsj_2335	2	Mr. Seelenfreund is executive vice president and chief financial officer of McKesson and will continue in those roles .

wsj_2335	4	Messrs. Malson and Seelenfreund are directors of McKesson , which has an 86 % stake in PCS .
wsj_2336	0	MedChem Products Inc. said a U.S. District Court in Boston ruled that a challenge by MedChem to the validity of a U.S. patent held by Pharmacia Inc. was `` without merit . ''
wsj_2336	1	Pharmacia , based in Upsala , Sweden , had charged in a lawsuit against MedChem that MedChem 's AMVISC product line infringes on the Pharmacia patent .
wsj_2336	2	The patent is related to hyaluronic acid , a rooster-comb extract used in eye surgery .
wsj_2336	3	In its lawsuit , Pharmacia is seeking unspecified damages and a preliminary injunction to block MedChem from selling the AMVISC products .
wsj_2336	4	A MedChem spokesman said the products contribute about a third of MedChem 's sales and 10 % to 20 % of its earnings .
wsj_2336	5	In the year ended Aug. 31 , 1988 , MedChem earned $ 2.9 million , or 72 cents a share , on sales of $ 17.4 million .
wsj_2336	6	MedChem said the court 's ruling was issued as part of a `` first-phase trial '' in the patent-infringement proceedings and concerns only one of its defenses in the case .
wsj_2336	7	It said it is considering `` all of its options in light of the decision , including a possible appeal . ''
wsj_2336	8	The medical-products company added that it plans to `` assert its other defenses '' against Pharmacia 's lawsuit , including the claim that it has n't infringed on Pharmacia 's patent .
wsj_2336	9	MedChem said that the court scheduled a conference for next Monday -- to set a date for proceedings on Pharmacia 's motion for a preliminary injunction .
wsj_2338	0	General Motors Corp. , in a series of moves that angered union officials in the U.S. and Canada , has signaled that as many as five North American assembly plants may not survive the mid-1990s as the corporation struggles to cut its excess vehicle-making capacity .
wsj_2338	1	In announcements to workers late last week , GM effectively signed death notices for two full-sized van assembly plants , and cast serious doubt on the futures of three U.S. car factories .
wsj_2338	2	GM is under intense pressure to close factories that became unprofitable as the giant auto maker 's U.S. market share skidded during the past decade .
wsj_2338	3	The company , currently using about 80 % of its North American vehicle capacity , has vowed it will run at 100 % of capacity by 1992 .
wsj_2338	4	Just a month ago , GM announced it would make an aging assembly plant in Lakewood , Ga. , the eighth U.S. assembly facility to close since 1987 .
wsj_2338	5	Now , GM appears to be stepping up the pace of its factory consolidation to get in shape for the 1990s .
wsj_2338	6	One reason is mounting competition from new Japanese car plants in the U.S. that are pouring out more than one million vehicles a year at costs lower than GM can match .
wsj_2338	7	Another is that United Auto Workers union officials have signaled they want tighter no-layoff provisions in the new Big Three national contract that will be negotiated next year .
wsj_2338	8	GM officials want to get their strategy to reduce capacity and the work force in place before those talks begin .
wsj_2338	9	The problem , however , is that GM 's moves are coming at a time when UAW leaders are trying to silence dissidents who charge the union is too passive in the face of GM layoffs .
wsj_2338	10	Against that backdrop , UAW Vice President Stephen P. Yokich , who recently became head of the union 's GM department , issued a statement Friday blasting GM 's `` flagrant insensitivity '' toward union members .
wsj_2338	11	The auto maker 's decision to let word of the latest shutdowns and product reassignments trickle out in separate communiques to the affected plants showed `` disarray '' and an `` inability or unwillingness to provide consistent information , '' Mr. Yokich said .
wsj_2338	12	GM officials told workers late last week of the following moves : Production of full-sized vans will be consolidated into a single plant in Flint , Mich .
wsj_2338	13	That means two plants -- one in Scarborough , Ontario , and the other in Lordstown , Ohio -- probably will be shut down after the end of 1991 .
wsj_2338	14	The shutdowns will idle about 3,000 Canadian assembly workers and about 2,500 workers in Ohio .
wsj_2338	15	Robert White , Canadian Auto Workers union president , used the impending Scarborough shutdown to criticize the U.S.-Canada free trade agreement and its champion , Prime Minister Brian Mulroney .
wsj_2338	16	But Canadian auto workers may benefit from a separate GM move that affects three U.S. car plants and one in Quebec .
wsj_2338	17	Workers at plants in Van Nuys , Calif. , Oklahoma City and Pontiac , Mich. , were told their facilities are no longer being considered to build the next generation of the Pontiac Firebird and Chevrolet Camaro muscle cars .
wsj_2338	18	GM is studying whether it can build the new Camaro-Firebird profitably at a plant in St. Therese , Quebec , company and union officials said .
wsj_2338	19	That announcement left union officials in Van Nuys and Oklahoma City uncertain about their futures .
wsj_2338	20	The Van Nuys plant , which employs about 3,000 workers , does n't have a product to build after 1993 .
wsj_2338	21	Jerry Shrieves , UAW local president , said the facility was asked to draw up plans to continue working as a `` flex plant , '' which could build several different types of products on short notice to satisfy demand .
wsj_2338	22	At the Oklahoma City plant , which employs about 6,000 workers building the eight-year-old A-body mid-sized cars , Steve Featherston , UAW local vice president , said the plant has no new product lined up , and `` none of us knows '' when the A-body cars will die .
wsj_2338	23	He said he believes GM has plans to keep building A-body cars into the mid-1990s .
wsj_2338	24	At Pontiac , however , the Camaro-Firebird decision appears to erase UAW hopes that GM would reopen the shuttered assembly plant that last built the plastic-bodied , two-seater Pontiac Fiero model .
wsj_2338	25	The Fiero plant was viewed as a model of union-management cooperation at GM before slow sales of the Fiero forced the company to close the factory last year .
wsj_2338	26	Union officials have taken a beating politically as a result .
wsj_2338	27	Dissident UAW members have used the Fiero plant as a symbol of labor-management cooperation 's failure .
wsj_2339	0	Institut Merieux S.A. of France said the Canadian government raised an obstacle to its proposed acquisition of Connaught BioSciences Inc. for 942 million Canadian dollars US$ 801.6 million .
wsj_2339	1	Merieux said the government 's minister of industry , science and technology told it that he was n't convinced that the purchase is likely to be of `` net benefit '' to Canada .
wsj_2339	2	Canadian investment rules require that big foreign takeovers meet that standard .
wsj_2339	3	The French company said the government gave it 30 days in which to submit information to further support its takeover plan .
wsj_2339	4	Both Merieux and Connaught are biotechnology research and vaccine manufacturing concerns .
wsj_2339	5	The government 's action was unusual .
wsj_2339	6	Alan Nymark , executive vice president of Investment Canada , which oversees foreign takeovers , said it marked the first time in its four-year history that the agency has made an adverse net-benefit decision about the acquisition of a publicly traded company .
wsj_2339	7	He said it has reached the same conclusions about some attempts to buy closely held concerns , but eventually allowed those acquisitions to proceed .
wsj_2339	8	`` This is n't a change in government policy ; this provision has been used before , '' said Jodi Redmond , press secretary for Harvie Andre , Canada 's minister of industry , science and technology .
wsj_2339	9	Mr. Andre issued the ruling based on a recommendation by Investment Canada .
wsj_2339	10	Spokesmen for Merieux and Connaught said they had n't been informed of specific areas of concern by either the government or Investment Canada , but added they hope to have more information early this week .
wsj_2339	11	Investment Canada declined to comment on the reasons for the government decision .
wsj_2339	12	Viren Mehta , a partner with Mehta & Isaly , a New York-based pharmaceutical industry research firm , said the government 's ruling was n't unexpected .
wsj_2339	13	`` This has become a very politicized deal , concerning Canada 's only large , world-class bio-research or pharmaceutical company , '' Mr. Mehta said .
wsj_2339	14	Mr. Mehta said the move that could allow the transaction to go ahead as planned could be an out-of-court settlement of Connaught 's dispute with the University of Toronto .
wsj_2339	15	The University is seeking to block the acquisition of Connaught by foreign interests , citing concerns about the amount of research that would be done in Canada .
wsj_2339	16	The university is considering a settlement proposal made by Connaught .
wsj_2339	17	While neither side will disclose its contents , Mr. Mehta expects it to contain more specific guarantees on research and development spending levels in Canada than Merieux offered to Investment Canada .
wsj_2339	18	Some analysts , such as Murray Grossner of Toronto-based Richardson Greenshields Inc. , believe the government ruling leaves the door open for other bidders , such as Switzerland 's Ciba-Geigy and Chiron Corp. of Emeryville , Calif .
wsj_2339	19	Officials for the two concerns , which are bidding C$ 30 a share for Connaught , could n't be reached for comment .
wsj_2339	20	French state-owned Rhone-Poulenc S.A. holds 51 % of Merieux .
wsj_2340	0	Weatherford International Inc. said it canceled plans for a preferred-stock swap but may resume payment of dividends on the stock , and added that it expects to publicly offer about 10 million common shares .
wsj_2340	1	The company said it planned to offer an undetermined number of common shares in exchange for the 585,000 shares of its preferred stock outstanding .
wsj_2340	2	The exchange ratio was never established .
wsj_2340	3	Weatherford said market conditions led to the cancellation of the planned exchange .
wsj_2340	4	The energy-services concern said , however , that in January 1990 , it may resume payments of dividends on the preferred stock .
wsj_2340	5	Weatherford suspended its preferred-dividend payment in October 1985 and said it has n't any plans to catch up on dividends in arrears about $ 6 million , but will do so some time in the future .
wsj_2340	6	Additionally , the company said it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the proposed offering of 10 million shares of common stock , expected to be offered in November .
wsj_2340	7	The company said Salomon Brothers Inc. and Howard , Weil , Labouisse , Friedrichs Inc. , underwriters for the offering , were granted an option to buy as much as an additional 1.5 million shares to cover over-allotments .
wsj_2340	8	Proceeds will be used to eliminate and restructure bank debt .
wsj_2340	9	Weatherford currently has approximately 11.1 million common shares outstanding .
wsj_2341	0	Earnings for most of the nation 's major pharmaceutical makers are believed to have moved ahead briskly in the third quarter , as companies with newer , big-selling prescription drugs fared especially well .
wsj_2341	1	For the third consecutive quarter , however , most of the companies ' revenues were battered by adverse foreign-currency translations as a result of the strong dollar abroad .
wsj_2341	2	Analysts said that Merck & Co. , Eli Lilly & Co. , Warner-Lambert Co. and the Squibb Corp. unit of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. all benefited from strong sales of relatively new , higher-priced medicines that provide wide profit margins .
wsj_2341	3	Less robust earnings at Pfizer Inc. and Upjohn Co. were attributed to those companies ' older products , many of which face stiffening competition from generic drugs and other medicines .
wsj_2341	4	Joseph Riccardo , an analyst with Bear , Stearns & Co. , said that over the past few years most drug makers have shed their slow-growing businesses and instituted other cost savings , such as consolidating manufacturing plants and administrative staffs .
wsj_2341	5	As a result , `` major new products are having significant impact , even on a company with very large revenues , '' Mr. Riccardo said .
wsj_2341	6	Analysts said profit for the dozen or so big drug makers , as a group , is estimated to have climbed between 11 % and 14 % .
wsj_2341	7	While that 's not spectacular , Neil Sweig , an analyst with Prudential Bache , said that the rate of growth will `` look especially good as compared to other companies if the economy turns downward . ''
wsj_2341	8	Mr. Sweig estimated that Merck 's profit for the quarter rose by about 22 % , propelled by sales of its line-up of fast-growing prescription drugs , including its anti-cholesterol drug , Mevacor ; a high blood pressure medicine , Vasotec ; Primaxin , an antibiotic , and Pepcid , an anti-ulcer medication .
wsj_2341	9	Profit climbed even though Merck 's sales were reduced by `` one to three percentage points '' as a result of the strong dollar , Mr. Sweig said .
wsj_2341	10	In the third quarter of 1988 , Merck earned $ 311.8 million , or 79 cents a share .
wsj_2341	11	In Rahway , N.J. , a Merck spokesman said the company does n't make earnings projections .
wsj_2341	12	Mr. Sweig said he estimated that Lilly 's earnings for the quarter jumped about 20 % , largely because of the performance of its new anti-depressant Prozac .
wsj_2341	13	The drug , introduced last year , is expected to generate sales of about $ 300 million this year .
wsj_2341	14	`` It 's turning out to be a real blockbuster , '' Mr. Sweig said .
wsj_2341	15	In last year 's third quarter , Lilly earned $ 171.4 million , or $ 1.20 a share .
wsj_2341	16	In Indianapolis , Lilly declined comment .
wsj_2341	17	Several analysts said they expected Warner-Lambert 's profit also to increase by more than 20 % from $ 87.7 million , or $ 1.25 a share , it reported in the like period last year .
wsj_2341	18	The company is praised by analysts for sharply lowering its costs in recent years and shedding numerous companies with low profit margins .
wsj_2341	19	The company 's lean operation , analysts said , allowed sharp-rising sales from its cholesterol drug , Lopid , to power earnings growth .
wsj_2341	20	Lopid sales are expected to be about $ 300 million this year , up from $ 190 million in 1988 .
wsj_2341	21	In Morris Plains , N.J. , a spokesman for the company said the analysts ' projections are `` in the ballpark . ''
wsj_2341	22	Squibb 's profit , estimated by analysts to be about 18 % above the $ 123 million , or $ 1.25 a share , it earned in the third quarter of 1988 , was the result of especially strong sales of its Capoten drug for treating high blood pressure and other heart disease .
wsj_2341	23	The company was officially merged with Bristol-Myers Co. earlier this month .
wsj_2341	24	Bristol-Myers declined to comment .
wsj_2341	25	Mr. Riccardo of Bear Stearns said that Schering-Plough Corp. 's expected profit rise of about 18 % to 20 % , and Bristol-Meyers 's expected profit increase of about 13 % are largely because `` those companies are really managed well . ''
wsj_2341	26	ScheringPlough earned $ 94.4 million , or 84 cents a share , while Bristol-Myers earned $ 232.3 million , or 81 cents a share , in the like period a year earlier .
wsj_2341	27	In Madison , N.J. , a spokesman for Schering-Plough said the company has `` no problems '' with the average estimate by a analysts that third-quarter earnings per share rose by about 19 % , to $ 1 .
wsj_2341	28	The company expects to achieve the 20 % increase in full-year earnings per share , as it projected in the spring , the spokesman said .
wsj_2341	29	Meanwhile , analysts said Pfizer 's recent string of lackluster quarterly performances continued , as earnings in the quarter were expected to decline by about 5 % .
wsj_2341	30	Sales of Pfizer 's important drugs , Feldene for treating arthritis , and Procardia , a heart medicine , have shrunk because of increased competition .
wsj_2341	31	`` The strong dollar hurt Pfizer a lot , too , '' Mr. Sweig said .
wsj_2341	32	In the third quarter last year , Pfizer earned $ 216.8 million , or $ 1.29 a share .
wsj_2341	33	In New York , the company declined comment .
wsj_2341	34	Analysts said they expected Upjohn 's profit to be flat or rise by only about 2 % to 4 % as compared with $ 89.6 million , or 49 cents a share , it earned a year ago .
wsj_2341	35	Upjohn 's biggest-selling drugs are Xanax , a tranquilizer , and Halcion , a sedative .
wsj_2341	36	Sales of both drugs have been hurt by new state laws restricting the prescriptions of certain tranquilizing medicines and adverse publicity about the excessive use of the drugs .
wsj_2341	37	Also , the company 's hair-growing drug , Rogaine , is selling well -- at about $ 125 million for the year , but the company 's profit from the drug has been reduced by Upjohn 's expensive print and television campaigns for advertising , analysts said .
wsj_2341	38	In Kalamazoo , Mich. , Upjohn declined comment .
wsj_2342	0	Amid a crowd of crashing stocks , Relational Technology Inc. 's stock fell particularly hard Friday , dropping 23 % because its problems were compounded by disclosure of an unexpected loss for its fiscal first quarter .
wsj_2342	1	The database software company said it expects a $ 2 million net loss for the fiscal first quarter ended Sept. 30 .
wsj_2342	2	It said analysts had been expecting a small profit for the period .
wsj_2342	3	Revenue is expected to be `` up modestly '' from the $ 26.5 million reported a year ago .
wsj_2342	4	Relational Technology reported net income of $ 1.5 million , or 12 cents a share , in the year-earlier period .
wsj_2342	5	`` While our international operations showed strong growth , our domestic business was substantially below expectations , '' said Paul Newton , president and chief executive officer .
wsj_2342	6	A spokesman said the company 's first quarter is historically soft , and computer companies in general are experiencing slower sales .
wsj_2342	7	Mr. Newton said he accepted the resignation of Thomas Wilson , vice president of corporate sales , and that his marketing responsibilities have been reassigned .
wsj_2342	8	The company said Mr. Wilson 's resignation was n't related to the sales shortfall .
wsj_2342	9	Relational Technology went public in May 1988 at $ 14 a share .
wsj_2342	10	It fell $ 1.875 a share Friday , to $ 6.25 , a new low , in over-the-counter trading .
wsj_2342	11	Its high for the past year was $ 16.375 a share .
wsj_2342	12	In the previous quarter , the company earned $ 4.5 million , or 37 cents a share , on sales of $ 47.2 million .
wsj_2344	0	Gulf Resources & Chemical Corp. said it agreed to pay $ 1.5 million as part of an accord with the Environmental Protection Agency regarding an environmental cleanup of a defunct smelter the company formerly operated in Idaho .
wsj_2344	1	In 1984 the EPA notified Gulf Resources , which was a part-owner of the smelter , that it was potentially liable for sharing cleanup costs at the site under the federal Superfund program .
wsj_2344	2	The 21-square-mile area is contaminated with lead , zinc and other metals .
wsj_2344	3	Gulf Resources earlier this year proposed a reorganization plan that would make it a unit of a Bermuda concern , potentially exempting it from liability for the smelter 's cleanup costs .
wsj_2344	4	The company said that as part of its agreement with the EPA , it `` made certain voluntary undertakings with respect to intercorporate transactions entered into after the reorganization . ''
wsj_2344	5	The company , which issued a statement on the agreement late Friday , said that $ 1 million of the payment was previously provided for in its financial statements and that $ 500,000 will be recognized in its 1989 third-quarter statement .
wsj_2344	6	The agreement and consent decree are subject to court approval , the company said .
wsj_2344	7	Gulf Resources added that it `` will seek to recover equitable contribution from others for both the amount of the settlement and any other liabilities it may incur under the Superfund law . ''
wsj_2344	8	Under the agreement , Gulf must give the U.S. government 45 days ' advance written notice before issuing any dividends on common stock .
wsj_2344	9	The company 's net worth can not fall below $ 185 million after the dividends are issued .
wsj_2344	10	`` The terms of that agreement only become effective the date of Gulf 's reorganization , which we anticipate will occur sometime in early 1990 , '' said Lawrence R. Mehl , Gulf 's general counsel .
wsj_2344	11	In addition , Gulf must give the government 20 days ' advance written notice of any loans exceeding $ 50 million that are made to the Bermuda-based holding company .
wsj_2344	12	Gulf 's net worth after those transaction must be at least $ 150 million .
wsj_2344	13	Separately , the company said it expects to hold a special meeting for shareholders in early 1990 to vote on its proposed reorganization .
wsj_2348	0	The government sold the deposits of four savings-and-loan institutions , in its first wave of sales of big , sick thrifts , but low bids prevented the sale of a fifth .
wsj_2348	1	The four S&Ls were sold to large banks , as was the case with most of the 28 previous transactions initiated by the Resolution Trust Corp. since it was created in the S&L bailout legislation two months ago .
wsj_2348	2	Two of the four big thrifts were sold to NCNB Corp. , Charlotte , N.C. , which has aggressively expanded its markets , particularly in Texas and Florida .
wsj_2348	3	A Canadian bank bought another thrift , in the first RTC transaction with a foreign bank .
wsj_2348	4	Under these deals , the RTC sells just the deposits and the healthy assets .
wsj_2348	5	These `` clean-bank '' transactions leave the bulk of bad assets , mostly real estate , with the government , to be sold later .
wsj_2348	6	In these four , for instance , the RTC is stuck with $ 4.51 billion in bad assets .
wsj_2348	7	Acquirers paid premiums ranging from 1.5 % to 3.7 % for the deposits and branch systems , roughly in line with what analysts were expecting .
wsj_2348	8	The buyers will also be locked into deposit rates for just two weeks , as has been the case with previous deals .
wsj_2348	9	After that , the buyers may repudiate the rates paid by the former thrifts .
wsj_2348	10	But it 's uncertain whether these institutions will take those steps .
wsj_2348	11	NCNB , for example , has been one of the highest rate payers in the Texas market , and in Florida , rates are especially sensitive in retirement communities .
wsj_2348	12	The RTC had previously targeted five thrifts for quick sales in order to spend cash by certain budgetary deadlines , but the delays illustrate the tough chore facing the agency .
wsj_2348	13	`` These thrifts are beached whales , '' said Bert Ely , an industry consultant based in Alexandria , Va .
wsj_2348	14	For example , the delay in selling People 's Heritage Savings , Salina , Kan. , with $ 1.7 billion in assets , has forced the RTC to consider selling off the thrift branch-by-branch , instead of as a whole institution .
wsj_2348	15	NCNB continued its foray into the Florida and Texas markets .
wsj_2348	16	NCNB will acquire University Federal Savings Association , Houston , which had assets of $ 2.8 billion .
wsj_2348	17	NCNB Texas National Bank will pay the RTC a premium of $ 129 million for $ 3.5 billion in deposits .
wsj_2348	18	As a measure of the depths to which the Texas real estate market has sunk , the RTC will pay $ 3.8 billion to NCNB to take $ 750 million of bad assets .
wsj_2348	19	NCNB also acquired Freedom Savings & Loan Association , Tampa , Fla. , which had total assets of $ 900 million .
wsj_2348	20	NCNB will pay the RTC a premium of $ 40.4 million for $ 1.1 billion in deposits .
wsj_2348	21	NCNB will also acquire $ 266 million of Freedom 's assets from the RTC , which will require $ 875 million in assistance .
wsj_2348	22	Meridian Bancorp Inc. , Reading , Pa. , will acquire Hill Financial Savings Association , Red Hill , Pa. , which had $ 2.3 billion in assets .
wsj_2348	23	Meridian will pay a premium of $ 30.5 million to assume $ 2 billion in deposits .
wsj_2348	24	It will also purchase $ 845 million of the thrift 's assets , with $ 1.9 billion in RTC assistance .
wsj_2348	25	In the first RTC transaction with a foreign buyer , Royal Trustco Ltd. , Toronto , will acquire Pacific Savings Bank , Costa Mesa , Calif. , which had $ 949 million in assets .
wsj_2348	26	Royal Trustco will pay the RTC $ 25 million to assume $ 989 million in deposits .
wsj_2348	27	It will also purchase $ 473 million in assets , and receive $ 550 million in assistance from the RTC .

wsj_2352	0	The Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals opinion in the Arcadian Phosphate case did not repudiate the position Pennzoil Co. took in its dispute with Texaco , contrary to your Sept. 8 article `` Court Backs Texaco 's View in Pennzoil Case -- Too Late . ''
wsj_2352	1	The fundamental rule of contract law applied to both cases was that courts will not enforce agreements to which the parties did not intend to be bound .
wsj_2352	2	In the Pennzoil/Texaco litigation , the courts found Pennzoil and Getty Oil intended to be bound ; in Arcadian Phosphates they found there was no intention to be bound .
wsj_2352	3	Admittedly , the principle in the cases is the same .
wsj_2352	4	But the outcome of a legal dispute almost always turns on the facts .
wsj_2352	5	And the facts , as found by the various courts in these two lawsuits , were different .

wsj_2353	0	Valley Federal Savings & Loan Association said Imperial Corp. of America withdrew from regulators its application to buy five Valley Federal branches , leaving the transaction in limbo .
wsj_2353	1	The broken purchase appears as additional evidence of trouble at Imperial Corp. , whose spokesman said the company withdrew its application from the federal Office of Thrift Supervision because of an informal notice that Imperial 's thrift unit failed to meet Community Reinvestment Act requirements .
wsj_2353	2	The Community Reinvestment Act requires savings and loan associations to lend money in amounts related to areas where deposits are received .
wsj_2353	3	The transaction , announced in August , included about $ 146 million in deposits at the five outlets in California 's San Joaquin Valley .
wsj_2353	4	Terms were n't disclosed , but Valley Federal had said it expected to post a modest pretax gain and to save about $ 2 million in operating costs annually .
wsj_2353	5	Valley Federal said Friday that it is considering whether to seek another buyer for the branches or to pursue the transaction with Imperial Corp. , which said it is attempting to meet Community Reinvestment Act requirements .
wsj_2353	6	Valley Federal , with assets of $ 3.3 billion , is based in Van Nuys .
wsj_2353	7	Imperial Corp. , based in San Diego , is the parent of Imperial Savings & Loan .

wsj_2356	0	SOUTH AFRICA FREED the ANC 's Sisulu and seven other political prisoners .
wsj_2356	1	Thousands of supporters , many brandishing flags of the outlawed African National Congress , gave the anti-apartheid activists a tumultuous reception upon their return to black townships across the country .
wsj_2356	2	Most of those freed had spent at least 25 years in prison .
wsj_2356	3	The 77-year-old Sisulu , sentenced to life in 1964 along with black nationalist Nelson Mandela for plotting to overthrow the government , said equality for blacks in South Africa was in reach .
wsj_2356	4	The releases , announced last week by President de Klerk , were viewed as Pretoria 's tacit legalization of the ANC .

wsj_2357	1	The decision is the latest move in an escalating battle between the franchisees and Mr. Posner that began in August .
wsj_2357	2	At the time , a group called R.B. Partners Ltd. , consisting of eight of Arby 's largest franchisees , offered more than $ 200 million to buy Arby 's Inc. , which is part of DWG Corp .
wsj_2357	3	DWG is a holding company controlled by Mr. Posner .
wsj_2357	4	One week later , Leonard H. Roberts , president and chief executive officer of Arby 's , was fired in a dispute with Mr. Posner .
wsj_2357	5	Friday , 42 franchisees announced the formation of an association -- called A.P. Association Inc. -- to `` preserve the integrity of the Arby 's system . ''
wsj_2357	6	The franchisees , owners or operators of 1,000 of the 1,900 franchised Arby 's in the U.S. , said : `` We have concluded that continued control of Arby 's by Victor Posner is totally unacceptable to us , because it is extremely likely to cause irreparable damage to the Arby 's system .
wsj_2357	7	We support all efforts to remove Victor Posner from control of Arby 's Inc. and the Arby 's system . ''
wsj_2357	8	The group said it would consider , among other things , withholding royalty payments and initiating a class-action lawsuit seeking court approval for the withholdings .

wsj_2358	0	September 's steep rise in producer prices shows that inflation still persists , and the pessimism over interest rates caused by the new price data contributed to the stock market 's plunge Friday .
wsj_2358	1	After falling for three consecutive months , the producer price index for finished goods shot up 0.9 % last month , the Labor Department reported Friday , as energy prices jumped after tumbling through the summer .
wsj_2358	2	Although the report , which was released before the stock market opened , did n't trigger the 190.58-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average , analysts said it did play a role in the market 's decline .
wsj_2358	3	Analysts immediately viewed the price data , the grimmest inflation news in months , as evidence that the Federal Reserve was unlikely to allow interest rates to fall as many investors had hoped .
wsj_2358	4	Further fueling the belief that pressures in the economy were sufficient to keep the Fed from easing credit , the Commerce Department reported Friday that retail sales grew 0.5 % in September , to $ 145.21 billion .
wsj_2358	5	That rise came on top of a 0.7 % gain in August , and suggested there is still healthy consumer demand in the economy .
wsj_2358	6	`` I think the Friday report , combined with the actions of the Fed , weakened the belief that there was going to be an imminent easing of monetary policy , '' said Robert Dederick , chief economist at Northern Trust Co. in Chicago .
wsj_2358	7	But economists were divided over the extent of the inflation threat signaled by the new numbers .
wsj_2358	8	`` The overall 0.9 % increase is serious in itself , but what is even worse is that excluding food and energy , the producer price index still increased by 0.7 % , '' said Gordon Richards , an economist at the National Association of Manufacturers .
wsj_2358	9	But Sung Won Sohn , chief economist at Norwest Corp. in Minneapolis , blamed rising energy prices and the annual autumn increase in car prices for most of the September jump .
wsj_2358	10	`` I would say this is not bad news ; this is a blip , '' he said .
wsj_2358	11	`` The core rate is not really out of line . ''
wsj_2358	12	All year , energy prices have skewed the producer price index , which measures changes in the prices producers receive for goods .
wsj_2358	13	Inflation unquestionably has fallen back from its torrid pace last winter , when a steep run-up in world oil prices sent the index surging at double-digit annual rates .
wsj_2358	14	Energy prices then plummeted through the summer , causing the index to decline for three consecutive months .
wsj_2358	15	Overall , the index has climbed at a 5.1 % compound annual rate since the start of the year , the Labor Department said .
wsj_2358	16	While far more restrained than the pace at the beginning of the year , that is still a steeper rise than the 4.0 % increase for all of 1988 .
wsj_2358	17	Moreover , this year 's good inflation news may have ended last month , when energy prices zoomed up 6.5 % after plunging 7.3 % in August .
wsj_2358	18	Some analysts expect oil prices to remain relatively stable in the months ahead , leaving the future pace of inflation uncertain .
wsj_2358	19	Analysts had expected that the climb in oil prices last month would lead to a substantial rise in the producer price index , but the 0.9 % climb was higher than most anticipated .
wsj_2358	20	`` I think the resurgence in inflation is going to continue for a few months , '' said John Mueller , chief economist at Bell Mueller Cannon , a Washington economic forecasting firm .
wsj_2358	21	He predicted that inflation will moderate next year , saying that credit conditions are fairly tight world-wide .
wsj_2358	22	But Dirk Van Dongen , president of the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors , said that last month 's rise `` is n't as bad an omen '' as the 0.9 % figure suggests .
wsj_2358	23	`` If you examine the data carefully , the increase is concentrated in energy and motor vehicle prices , rather than being a broad-based advance in the prices of consumer and industrial goods , '' he explained .
wsj_2358	24	Passenger car prices jumped 3.8 % in September , after climbing 0.5 % in August and declining in the late spring and summer .
wsj_2358	25	Many analysts said the September increase was a one-time event , coming as dealers introduced their 1990 models .
wsj_2358	26	Although all the price data were adjusted for normal seasonal fluctuations , car prices rose beyond the customary autumn increase .
wsj_2358	27	Prices for capital equipment rose a hefty 1.1 % in September , while prices for home electronic equipment fell 1.1 % .
wsj_2358	28	Food prices declined 0.6 % , after climbing 0.3 % in August .
wsj_2358	29	Meanwhile , the retail sales report showed that car sales rose 0.8 % in September to $ 32.82 billion .
wsj_2358	30	But at least part of the increase could have come from higher prices , analysts said .

wsj_2359	0	CityFed Financial Corp. said it expects to report a loss of at least $ 125 million to $ 150 million for the third quarter .
wsj_2359	1	In the year-earlier period , CityFed had net income of $ 485,000 , but no per-share earnings .
wsj_2359	2	CityFed 's president and chief executive officer , John Atherton , said the loss stems from several factors .
wsj_2359	3	He said nonperforming assets rose to slightly more than $ 700 million from $ 516 million between June and September .
wsj_2359	4	Approximately 85 % of the total consisted of nonperforming commercial real estate assets .
wsj_2359	5	Accordingly , CityFed estimated that it will provide between $ 85 million and $ 110 million for credit losses in the third quarter .
wsj_2359	6	CityFed added that significant additional loan-loss provisions may be required by federal regulators as part of the current annual examination of City Federal Savings Bank , CityFed 's primary subsidiary , based in Somerset , N.J .
wsj_2359	7	City Federal operates 105 banking offices in New Jersey and Florida .
wsj_2359	8	Mr. Atherton said CityFed will also mark its portfolio of high-yield corporate bonds to market as a result of federal legislation requiring that savings institutions divest themselves of such bonds .
wsj_2359	9	That action , CityFed said , will result in a charge against third-quarter results of approximately $ 30 million .
wsj_2359	10	CityFed also said it expects to shed its remaining mortgage loan origination operations outside its principal markets in New Jersey and Florida and , as a result , is taking a charge for discontinued operations .
wsj_2359	11	All these actions , Mr. Atherton said , will result in a loss of $ 125 million to $ 150 million for the third quarter .
wsj_2359	12	He added , however : `` Depending on the resolution of certain accounting issues relating to mortgages servicing and the outcome of the annual examination of City Federal currently in progress with respect to the appropriate level of loan loss reserves , the total loss for the quarter could significantly exceed this range .
wsj_2360	0	CenTrust Savings Bank said federal thrift regulators ordered it to suspend dividend payments on its two classes of preferred stock , indicating that regulators ' concerns about the troubled institution have heightened .
wsj_2360	1	In a statement , Miami-based CenTrust said the regulators cited the thrift 's operating losses and `` apparent losses '' in its junk-bond portfolio in ordering the suspension of the dividends .
wsj_2360	2	Regulators also ordered CenTrust to stop buying back the preferred stock .
wsj_2360	3	David L. Paul , chairman and chief executive officer , criticized the federal Office of Thrift Supervision , which issued the directive , saying it was `` inappropriate '' and based on `` insufficient '' reasons .
wsj_2360	4	He said the thrift will try to get regulators to reverse the decision .
wsj_2360	5	The suspension of a preferred stock dividend is a serious step that signals that regulators have deep concerns about an institution 's health .
wsj_2360	6	In March , regulators labeled CenTrust a `` troubled institution , '' largely because of its big junk-bond holdings and its operating losses .
wsj_2360	7	In the same month , the Office of Thrift Supervision ordered the institution to stop paying common stock dividends until its operations were on track .
wsj_2360	8	For the nine months ended June 30 , CenTrust had a net loss of $ 21.3 million , compared with year-earlier net income of $ 52.8 million .
wsj_2360	9	CenTrust , which is Florida 's largest thrift , holds one of the largest junk-bond portfolios of any thrift in the nation .
wsj_2360	10	Since April , it has pared its high-yield bond holdings to about $ 890 million from $ 1.35 billion .
wsj_2360	11	Mr. Paul said only about $ 150 million of the current holdings are tradeable securities registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission .
wsj_2360	12	The remainder , he said , are commercial loan participations , or private placements , that are n't filed with the SEC and do n't have a ready market .
wsj_2360	13	CenTrust and regulators have been in a dispute over market valuations for the junk bonds .
wsj_2360	14	The Office of Thrift Supervision has been hounding CenTrust to provide current market values for its holdings , but CenTrust has said it ca n't easily obtain such values because of the relative illiquidity of the bonds and lack of a ready market .
wsj_2360	15	Regulators have become increasingly antsy about CenTrust 's and other thrifts ' junk-bond holdings in light of the recent federal thrift bailout legislation and the recent deep decline in the junk-bond market .
wsj_2360	16	The legislation requires thrifts to divest themselves of junk bonds in the new , somber regulatory climate .
wsj_2360	17	In American Stock Exchange composite trading Friday , CenTrust common shares closed at $ 3 , down 12.5 cents .
wsj_2360	18	In a statement Friday , Mr. Paul challenged the regulators ' decision , saying the thrift 's operating losses and `` apparent '' junk-bond losses `` have been substantially offset by gains in other activities of the bank . ''
wsj_2360	19	He also said substantial reserves have been set aside for possible losses from the junk bonds .
wsj_2360	20	In the third quarter , for instance , CenTrust added $ 22.5 million to its general reserves .
wsj_2360	21	Mr. Paul said the regulators should instead move ahead with approving CenTrust 's request to sell 63 of its 71 branches to Great Western Bank , a unit of Great Western Financial Corp. based in Beverly Hills , Calif .
wsj_2360	22	The branch sale is the centerpiece of CenTrust 's strategy to transform itself into a traditional S&L from a high-flying institution that relied heavily on securities trading for profits , according to Mr. Paul .
wsj_2360	23	Most analysts and thrift executives had expected a decision on the proposed transaction , which was announced in July , long before now .
wsj_2360	24	Many interpret the delay as an indication that regulators are skeptical about the proposal .
wsj_2360	25	Branches and deposits can be sold at a premium in the event federal regulators take over an institution .
wsj_2360	26	CenTrust , however , touts the branch sale , saying it would bring in $ 150 million and reduce the thrift 's assets to $ 6.7 billion from $ 9 billion .
wsj_2360	27	It said the sale would give it positive tangible capital of $ 82 million , or about 1.2 % of assets , from a negative $ 33 million as of Sept. 30 , thus bringing CenTrust close to regulatory standards .
wsj_2360	28	CenTrust said the branch sale would also reduce the company 's large amount of good will by about $ 180 million .
wsj_2360	29	Critics , however , say the branch sale will make CenTrust more dependent than ever on brokered deposits and junk bonds .
wsj_2360	30	Mr. Paul counters that he intends to further pare the size of CenTrust by not renewing more than $ 1 billion of brokered certificates of deposit when they come due .
wsj_2360	31	The thrift is also working to unload its junk-bond portfolio by continuing to sell off the bonds , and it plans to eventually place some of them in a separate affiliate , as required under the new thrift law .
wsj_2362	0	British Aerospace PLC and France 's Thomson-CSF S.A. said they are nearing an agreement to merge their guided-missile divisions , greatly expanding collaboration between the two defense contractors .
wsj_2362	1	The 50-50 joint venture , which may be dubbed Eurodynamics , would have combined annual sales of at least # 1.4 billion $ 2.17 billion and would be among the world 's largest missile makers .
wsj_2362	2	After two years of talks , plans for the venture are sufficiently advanced for the companies to seek French and British government clearance .
wsj_2362	3	The companies hope for a final agreement by year-end .
wsj_2362	4	The venture would strengthen the rapidly growing ties between the two companies , and help make them a leading force in European defense contracting .
wsj_2362	5	In recent months , a string of cross-border mergers and joint ventures have reshaped the once-balkanized world of European arms manufacture .
wsj_2362	6	Already , British Aerospace and French government-controlled Thomson-CSF collaborate on a British missile contract and on an air-traffic control radar system .
wsj_2362	7	Just last week they announced they may make a joint bid to buy Ferranti International Signal PLC , a smaller British defense contractor rocked by alleged accounting fraud at a U.S. unit .
wsj_2362	8	The sudden romance of British Aerospace and Thomson-CSF -- traditionally bitter competitors for Middle East and Third World weapons contracts -- is stirring controversy in Western Europe 's defense industry .
wsj_2362	9	Most threatened by closer British Aerospace-Thomson ties would be their respective national rivals , including Matra S.A. in France and Britain 's General Electric Co. PLC .
wsj_2362	10	But neither Matra nor GEC -- unrelated to Stamford , Conn.-based General Electric Co. -- are sitting quietly by as their competitors join forces .
wsj_2362	11	Yesterday , a source close to GEC confirmed that his company may join the Ferranti fight , as part of a possible consortium that would bid against British Aerospace and Thomson-CSF .
wsj_2362	12	Companies with which GEC has had talks about a possible joint Ferranti bid include Matra , Britain 's Dowty Group PLC , West Germany 's Daimler-Benz AG , and France 's Dassault group .
wsj_2362	13	But it may be weeks before GEC and its potential partners decide whether to bid , the source indicated .
wsj_2362	14	GEC plans first to study Ferranti 's financial accounts , which auditors recently said included # 215 million in fictitious contracts at a U.S. unit , International Signal & Control Group , with which Ferranti merged last year .
wsj_2362	15	Also , any GEC bid might be blocked by British antitrust regulators ; Ferranti is GEC 's main competitor on several key defense-electronics contracts , and its purchase by GEC may heighten British Defense Ministry worries about concentration in the country 's defense industry .
wsj_2362	16	A consortium bid , however , would diminish GEC 's direct role in Ferranti and might consequently appease ministry officials .
wsj_2362	17	A British Aerospace spokeswoman appeared unperturbed by the prospect of a fight with GEC for Ferranti : `` Competition is the name of the game , '' she said .
wsj_2362	18	At least one potential GEC partner , Matra , insists it is n't interested in Ferranti .
wsj_2362	19	`` We have nothing to say about this affair , which does n't concern us , '' a Matra official said Sunday .
wsj_2362	20	The missile venture , the British Aerospace spokeswoman said , is a needed response to the `` new environment '' in defense contracting .
wsj_2362	21	For both Thomson and British Aerospace , earnings in their home markets have come under pressure from increasingly tight-fisted defense ministries ; and Middle East sales , a traditional mainstay for both companies ' exports , have been hurt by five years of weak oil prices .
wsj_2362	22	The venture 's importance for Thomson is great .
wsj_2362	23	Thomson feels the future of its defense business depends on building cooperation with other Europeans .
wsj_2362	24	The European defense industry is consolidating ; for instance , West Germany 's Siemens AG recently joined GEC in a takeover of Britain 's Plessey Co. , and Daimler-Benz agreed to buy Messerschmitt-Boelkow Blohm G.m.b . H .
wsj_2362	25	In missiles , Thomson is already overshadowed by British Aerospace and by its home rival , France 's Aerospatiale S.A. ; to better compete , Thomson officials say , they need a partnership .
wsj_2362	26	To justify 50-50 ownership of the planned venture , Thomson would make a cash payment to British Aerospace .
wsj_2362	27	Annual revenue of British Aerospace 's missile business is about # 950 million , a Thomson spokesman said .
wsj_2362	28	British Aerospace 's chief missile products include its 17-year-old family of Rapier surface-to-air missiles .
wsj_2362	29	Thomson missile products , with about half British Aerospace 's annual revenue , include the Crotale surface-to-air missile family .
wsj_2363	0	Interprovincial Pipe Line Co. said it will delay a proposed two-step , 830 million Canadian-dollar US$ 705.6 million expansion of its system because Canada 's output of crude oil is shrinking .
wsj_2363	1	Interprovincial , Canada 's biggest oil pipeline operator and a major transporter of crude to the U.S. , said revised industry forecasts indicate that Canadian oil output will total about 1.64 million barrels a day by 1991 , 8 % lower than a previous estimate .
wsj_2363	2	Canadian crude production averaged about 1.69 million barrels a day during 1989 's first half , about 1 % below the 1988 level .
wsj_2363	3	`` The capability of existing fields to deliver oil is dropping , '' and oil exploration activity is also down dramatically , as many producers shift their emphasis to natural gas , said Ronald Watkins , vice president for government and industry relations with Interprovincial 's parent , Interhome Energy Inc .
wsj_2363	4	Mr. Watkins said volume on Interprovincial 's system is down about 2 % since January and is expected to fall further , making expansion unnecessary until perhaps the mid-1990s .
wsj_2363	5	`` There has been a swing of the pendulum back to the gas side , '' he said .
wsj_2363	6	Many of Canada 's oil and gas producers say the outlook for natural gas is better than it is for oil , and have shifted their exploration and development budgets accordingly .
wsj_2363	7	The number of active drilling rigs in Canada is down 30 % from a year ago , and the number of completed oil wells is `` down more than that , due to the increasing focus on gas exploration , '' said Robert Feick , manager of crude oil with Calgary 's Independent Petroleum Association of Canada , an industry group .
wsj_2363	8	Mr. Watkins said the main reason for the production decline is shrinking output of light crude from mature , conventional fields in western Canada .
wsj_2363	9	Interprovincial transports about 75 % of all crude produced in western Canada , and almost 60 % of Interprovincial 's total volume consists of light crude .
wsj_2363	10	Nearly all of the crude oil that Canada exports to the U.S. is transported on Interprovincial 's system , whose main line runs from Edmonton to major U.S. and Canadian cities in the Great Lakes region , including Chicago , Buffalo , Toronto and Montreal .
wsj_2363	11	Canada 's current oil exports to the U.S. total about 600,000 barrels a day , or about 9.1 % of net U.S. crude imports , said John Lichtblau , president of the New York-based Petroleum Industry Research Foundation .
wsj_2363	12	That ranks Canada as the fourth-largest source of imported crude , behind Saudi Arabia , Nigeria and Mexico .
wsj_2363	13	Mr. Lichtblau said Canada 's declining crude output , combined with the fast-shrinking output of U.S. crude , will help intensify U.S. reliance on oil from overseas , particularly the Middle East .
wsj_2363	14	`` It 's very much a growing concern .
wsj_2363	15	But when something is inevitable , you learn to live with it , '' he said .
wsj_2363	16	Mr. Lichtblau stressed that the delay of Interprovincial 's proposed expansion wo n't by itself increase U.S. dependence on offshore crude , however , since Canadian imports are limited in any case by Canada 's falling output .
wsj_2363	17	Under terms of its proposed two-step expansion , which would have required regulatory approval , Interprovincial intended to add 200,000 barrels a day of additional capacity to its system , beginning with a modest expansion by 1991 .
wsj_2363	18	The system currently has a capacity of 1.55 million barrels a day .
wsj_2364	0	Inland Steel Industries Inc. expects to report that third-quarter earnings dropped more than 50 % from the previous quarter as a result of reduced sales volume and increased costs .
wsj_2364	1	In the second quarter , the steelmaker had net income of $ 45.3 million or $ 1.25 a share , including a pretax charge of $ 17 million related to the settlement of a suit , on sales of $ 1.11 billion .
wsj_2364	2	The company said normal seasonal softness and lost orders caused by prolonged labor talks reduced shipments by 200,000 tons in the latest quarter , compared with the second quarter .
wsj_2364	3	At the same time , the integrated-steel business was hurt by continued increases in materials costs and repair and maintenance expenses , as well as higher labor costs under its new contract .
wsj_2364	4	The service-center business was hurt by reduced margins and start-up costs associated with its Joseph T. Ryerson & Son unit .
wsj_2364	5	The company said it is beginning to see some shipping-rate improvements in both the intergrated-steel and steel-service-center segments , which should result in improved results for the fourth quarter .
wsj_2364	6	Inland said its third-quarter results will be announced later this week .
wsj_2364	7	In the year-earlier third quarter , when the industry was in the midst of a boom , the company had net of $ 61 million , or $ 1.70 a share , on sales of $ 1.02 billion .
wsj_2368	0	The only thing Robert Goldberg could praise about CBS 's new show `` Island Son '' Leisure & Arts , Sept. 25 was the local color ; unfortunately neither he nor the producers of the show have done their homework .
wsj_2368	1	For instance : `` Haole '' white is not the ultimate insult ; `` Mainland haole '' is .
wsj_2368	2	Richard Chamberlain dresses as a `` Mainland haole , '' tucking in a Hawaiian shirt and rolling up its long sleeves .
wsj_2368	3	And the local expression for brother is `` brah , '' not `` bruddah . ''
wsj_2368	4	And even if a nurse would wear flowers in her hair while on duty , if she were engaged she would know to wear them behind her left , not right , ear .
wsj_2368	5	Sorry , the show does not even have the one redeeming quality of genuine local color .
wsj_2369	0	Of all the ethnic tensions in America , which is the most troublesome right now ?
wsj_2369	1	A good bet would be the tension between blacks and Jews in New York City .
wsj_2369	2	Or so it must seem to Jackie Mason , the veteran Jewish comedian appearing in a new ABC sitcom airing on Tuesday nights 9:30-10 p.m. EDT .
wsj_2369	3	Not only is Mr. Mason the star of `` Chicken Soup , '' he 's also the inheritor of a comedic tradition dating back to `` Duck Soup , '' and he 's currently a man in hot water .
wsj_2369	4	Here , in neutral language , is the gist of Mr. Mason 's remarks , quoted first in the Village Voice while he was a paid spokesman for the Rudolph Giuliani mayoral campaign , and then in Newsweek after he and the campaign parted company .
wsj_2369	5	Mr. Mason said that many Jewish voters feel guilty toward blacks , so they support black candidates uncritically .
wsj_2369	6	He said that many black voters feel bitter about racial discrimination , so they , too , support black candidates uncritically .
wsj_2369	7	He said that Jews have contributed more to black causes over the years than vice versa .
wsj_2369	8	Of course , Mr. Mason did not use neutral language .
wsj_2369	9	As a practitioner of ethnic humor from the old days on the Borscht Belt , live television and the nightclub circuit , Mr. Mason instinctively reached for the vernacular .
wsj_2369	10	He said Jews were `` sick with complexes '' ; and he called David Dinkins , Mr. Giuliani 's black opponent , `` a fancy shvartze with a mustache . ''
wsj_2369	11	If Mr. Mason had used less derogatory language to articulate his amateur analysis of the voting behavior of his fellow New Yorkers , would the water be quite so hot ?
wsj_2369	12	It probably would , because few or none of the people upset by Mr. Mason 's remarks have bothered to distinguish between the substance of his comments and the fact that he used insulting language .
wsj_2369	13	In addition , some of Mr. Mason 's critics have implied that his type of ethnic humor is itself a form of racism .
wsj_2369	14	For example , the New York state counsel for the NAACP said that Mr. Mason is `` like a dinosaur .
wsj_2369	15	People are fast leaving the place where he is stuck . ''
wsj_2369	16	These critics fail to distinguish between the type of ethnic humor that aims at disparaging another group , such as `` Polish jokes '' ; and the type that is double-edged , aiming inward as well as outward .
wsj_2369	17	The latter typically is the humor of the underdog , and it was perfected by both blacks and Jews on the minstrel and vaudeville stage as a means of mocking their white and gentile audiences along with themselves .
wsj_2369	18	In the hands of a zealot like Lenny Bruce , this double-edged blade could cut both the self and the audience to ribbons .
wsj_2369	19	But wielded by a pro like Jackie Mason , it is a constructive form of mischief .
wsj_2369	20	Because despite all the media prattle about comedy and politics not mixing , they are similar in one respect : Both can serve as mechanisms for easing tensions and facilitating the co-existence of groups in conflict .
wsj_2369	21	That 's why it 's dangerous to have well-intentioned thought police , on college campuses and elsewhere , taboo all critical mention of group differences .
wsj_2369	22	As Elizabeth Kristol wrote in the New York Times just before the Mason donnybrook , `` Perhaps intolerance would not boil over with such intensity if honest differences were allowed to simmer . ''
wsj_2369	23	The question is , if group conflicts still exist as undeniably they do , and if Mr. Mason 's type of ethnic humor is passe , then what other means do we have for letting off steam ?
wsj_2369	24	Do n't say the TV sitcom , because that happens to be a genre that , in its desperate need to attract everybody and offend nobody , resembles politics more than it does comedy .
wsj_2369	25	It is true that the best sitcoms do allow group differences to simmer : yuppies vs. blue-collar Bostonians in `` Cheers '' ; children vs. adults in `` The Cosby Show . ''
wsj_2369	26	But these are not the differences that make headlines .
wsj_2369	27	In `` Chicken Soup , '' Mr. Mason plays Jackie , a Jewish bachelor courting Maddie Lynn Redgrave , an Irish widow and mother of three , against the wishes of his mother Rita Karin and her brother Michael Brandon Maggart .
wsj_2369	28	It 's worth noting that both disapproving relatives are immigrants .
wsj_2369	29	At least , they both speak with strong accents , as do Jackie and Maddie .
wsj_2369	30	It could n't be more obvious that `` Chicken Soup '' is being made from an old recipe .
wsj_2369	31	And a safe one -- imagine if the romance in question were between an Orthodox Jew and a member of the Nation of Islam .
wsj_2369	32	Back in the 1920s , the play and movie versions of `` Abie 's Irish Rose '' made the theme of courtship between the assimilated offspring of Jewish and Irish immigrants so popular that its author , Anne Nichols , lost a plagiarism suit on the grounds that the plot has entered the public domain .
wsj_2369	33	And it has remained there , as evidenced by its reappearance in a 1972 CBS sitcom called `` Bridget Loves Bernie , '' whose sole distinction was that it led to the real-life marriage of Meredith Baxter and David Birney .
wsj_2369	34	Clearly , the question with `` Chicken Soup '' is not whether the pot will boil over , but whether it will simmer at all .
wsj_2369	35	So far , the bubbles have been few and far between .
wsj_2369	36	Part of the problem is the tendency of all sitcoms , ever since the didactic days of Norman Lear , to preach about social issues .
wsj_2369	37	To some extent , this tendency emerges whenever the show tries to enlighten us about ethnic stereotypes by reversing them .
wsj_2369	38	For instance , Michael dislikes Jackie not because he 's a shrewd Jewish businessman , but because he quits his well-paying job as a salesman in order to become a social worker .
wsj_2369	39	Even more problematic is the incompatibility between sitcom preachiness and Mr. Mason 's comic persona .
wsj_2369	40	The best moments in the show occur at the beginning and the end and occasionally in the middle , when Mr. Mason slips into his standup mode and starts meting out that old-fashioned Jewish mischief to other people as well as to himself .
wsj_2369	41	But too often , these routines lack spark because this sitcom , like all sitcoms , is timid about confronting Mr. Mason 's stock in trade - ethnic differences .
wsj_2369	42	I 'm not suggesting that the producers start putting together episodes about topics like the Catholic-Jewish dispute over the Carmelite convent at Auschwitz .
wsj_2369	43	That issue , like racial tensions in New York City , will have to cool down , not heat up , before it can simmer .
wsj_2369	44	But I am suggesting that they stop requiring Mr. Mason to interrupt his classic shtik with some line about `` caring for other people '' that would sound shmaltzy on the lips of Miss America .
wsj_2369	45	At your age , Jackie , you ought to know that you ca n't make soup without turning up the flame .

wsj_2375	9	`` I think it was a little premature on their part .
wsj_2378	0	It was Friday the 13th , and the stock market plummeted nearly 200 points .
wsj_2378	1	Or is triskaidekaphobia -- fear of the number 13 -- justified ?
wsj_2378	2	In academia , a so-called Friday the 13th effect has been set up and shot down by different professors .
wsj_2378	3	Robert Kolb and Ricardo Rodriguez , professors of finance at the University of Miami , found evidence that the market is spooked by Friday the 13th .
wsj_2378	4	But their study , which spanned the 1962-85 period , has since been shown to be jinxed by an unlucky choice of data .
wsj_2378	5	In the '70s , the market took falls nine times in a row on Friday the you-know-what .
wsj_2378	6	But the date tends to be a plus , not a minus , for stocks , according to Yale Hirsch , a collector of stock market lore .
wsj_2378	7	Another study found that the 82 Fridays the 13th in the 1940-1987 period had higher than average returns -- higher even than Fridays in general , which tend to be strong days for stock prices .
wsj_2378	8	On the only other Friday the 13th this year , the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about four points .
wsj_2378	9	Professor Kolb says the original study , titled Friday the 13th , Part VII , was published tongue-in-cheek .
wsj_2378	10	In a similar vein , he adds that the anniversary of the 1987 crash and Saturday 's full moon could have played a part , too , in Friday 's market activity .

wsj_2382	0	Food and Drug Administration spokesman Jeff Nesbit said the agency has turned over evidence in a criminal investigation concerning Vitarine Pharmaceuticals Inc. to the U.S. Attorney 's office in Baltimore .
wsj_2382	1	Neither Vitarine nor any of the Springfield Gardens , N.Y. , company 's officials or employees have been charged with any crimes .
wsj_2382	2	Vitarine won approval to market a version of a blood pressure medicine but acknowledged that it substituted a SmithKline Beecham PLC product as its own in tests .
wsj_2382	3	Mr. Nesbit also said the FDA has asked Bolar Pharmaceutical Co. to recall at the retail level its urinary tract antibiotic .
wsj_2382	4	But so far the company has n't complied with that request , the spokesman said .
wsj_2382	5	Bolar , the subject of a criminal investigation by the FDA and the Inspector General 's office of the Health and Human Services Department , only agreed to recall two strengths of its version of Macrodantin `` as far down as direct customers , mostly wholesalers , '' Mr. Nesbit said .
wsj_2382	6	Bolar , of Copiague , N.Y. , earlier began a voluntary recall of both its 100 milligram and 50 milligram versions of the drug .
wsj_2382	7	The FDA has said it presented evidence it uncovered to the company indicating that Bolar substituted the brand-name product for its own to gain government approval to sell generic versions of Macrodantin .
wsj_2382	8	Bolar has denied that it switched the brand-name product for its own in such testing .
wsj_2383	0	The West German retailer ASKO Deutsche Kaufhaus AG plans to challenge the legality of a widely employed anti-takeover defense of companies in the Netherlands .
wsj_2383	1	The eventual court decision could become a landmark in Dutch corporate law because the lawsuit ASKO plans to file would be the first to challenge the entire principle and practice of companies issuing voting preferred shares to management-controlled trusts to dilute voting power of common stockholders .
wsj_2383	2	Up to now only specific aspects of these defenses have been challenged , though unsuccessfully , ASKO 's Dutch lawyers noted .
wsj_2383	3	Should the courts uphold the validity of this type of defense , ASKO will then ask the court to overturn such a vote-diluting maneuver recently deployed by Koninklijke Ahold NV .
wsj_2383	4	ASKO says the Dutch-based international food retailer had n't reasonable grounds to issue preferred stock to a friendly trust and thus dilute the worth and voting power of ASKO and other shareholders .
wsj_2383	5	Speaking through its Dutch lawyers , ASKO also disclosed it holds a 15 % stake in Ahold .
wsj_2383	6	It was previously thought ASKO held a 13.6 % stake that was accumulated since July .
wsj_2383	7	A spokesman for Ahold said his company is confident of its own position and the propriety of the preferred-share issue .
wsj_2383	8	He termed ASKO 's legal actions as `` unproductive '' to international cooperation among European retailers .

wsj_2389	2	The index , which registered 156.8 at the end of September , has a base of 100 set in 1983 and is n't seasonally adjusted .

wsj_2392	0	Ford Motor Co. said it acquired 5 % of the shares in Jaguar PLC .
wsj_2392	1	Jaguar , the London Stock Exchange and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission are being notified of the transactions , the company said .
wsj_2392	2	The U.S. Federal Trade Commission advised Ford last week that it would n't raise any objection to the acquisition of as much as 15 % of Jaguar shares .
wsj_2392	3	The No. 2 auto maker disclosed last month that it wants to buy as much as 15 % of the British luxury-car maker , the maximum allowed under current United Kingdom government restrictions .
wsj_2392	4	General Motors Corp. said it had discussed the possibility of a joint venture with Jaguar before Ford began buying shares .
wsj_2392	5	GM said it still is talking with Jaguar about acquiring a minority interest .
wsj_2394	0	Avis Inc. , following rival Hertz Corp. 's lead , said it is backing out of frequent-flier programs with three airlines .
wsj_2394	1	The Garden City , N.Y. , car-rental company said it wo n't renew contracts with NWA Inc. 's Northwest Airlines unit , Pan Am Corp. 's Pan American World Airways unit and Midway Airlines at the end of this year .
wsj_2394	2	But it remains involved in programs with AMR Corp. 's American Airlines unit and Delta Air Lines .
wsj_2394	3	Industry estimates put Avis 's annual cost of all five programs at between $ 8 million and $ 14 million .
wsj_2394	4	A spokesman for Avis would n't specify the costs but said the three airlines being dropped account for `` far less than half '' of the total .
wsj_2394	5	Budget Rent a Car Corp. , of Chicago , and National Car Rental Systems Inc. , of Minneapolis , both said they had no plans to follow suit .
wsj_2394	6	In fact , Budget indicated it saw some benefit to staying involved in these programs , in which renters earn frequent-flier miles and fliers can get car-rental discounts .
wsj_2394	7	`` I can not see how this news by Hertz and Avis can not benefit Budget 's programs , '' said Bob Wilson , Budget 's vice president , marketing planning .
wsj_2394	8	Northwest and Midway are two of the five airlines with which Budget has agreements .
wsj_2394	9	National also participates in the Northwest frequent-flier program along with four other airlines , including Delta and USAir Group Inc. 's USAir unit .
wsj_2394	10	A month ago , Hertz , of Park Ridge , N.J. , said that it would drop its marketing agreements at year end with Delta , America West and Texas Air Corp. 's Continental Airlines and Eastern Airlines , and that pacts with American Airlines , UAL Inc 's United Airlines and USAir also would be ended ... sometime after Dec. 31 .
wsj_2394	11	At the time , Hertz said its annual fees to those airlines amounted to $ 20 million and that the value of redeemed awards topped $ 15 million .
wsj_2394	12	Analysts and competitors , however , doubt the numbers were that high .
wsj_2394	13	Budget said its frequent-flier costs are `` substantially below '' Avis 's level .
wsj_2394	14	Robert D. Cardillo , Avis vice president of marketing , said , `` The proliferation and costs attached to frequent-flier programs have significantly diminished their value . ''
wsj_2394	15	This year has been difficult for both Hertz and Avis , said Charles Finnie , car-rental industry analyst at Alex . Brown & Sons .
wsj_2394	16	`` They 've been looking to get their costs down , and this is a fairly sensible way to do it , '' he said .
wsj_2395	0	CBS Inc. is cutting `` The Pat Sajak Show '' down to one hour from its current 90 minutes .
wsj_2395	1	CBS insisted the move was n't a setback for the program , which is the network 's first entry into the late-night talk show format since 1972 .
wsj_2395	2	`` I have every intention of making this the best possible show and having it run one hour is the best way to it , '' said Rod Perth , who was named vice president of late night entertainment in August .
wsj_2395	3	`` This will raise the energy level of the show . ''
wsj_2395	4	CBS will continue to program action-adventure shows to follow the Sajak hour .
wsj_2395	5	But CBS News will extend its four-hour `` Nightwatch '' by 30 minutes and begin at 1:30 a.m .
wsj_2395	6	The show , despite a promising start , has slipped badly in the weekly ratings as compiled by A.C. Nielsen Co. , finishing far below `` Tonight '' on NBC , a unit of General Electric Co. , and `` Nightline '' on ABC-TV , a unit of Capital Cities/ABC Inc .
wsj_2395	7	Further fractioning the late-night audience is the addition of the `` Arsenio Hall Show , '' syndicated by Paramount Communications Inc .
wsj_2396	0	Tandem Computers Inc. , preparing to fight with International Business Machines Corp. for a piece of the mainframe business , said it expects to post higher revenue and earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter ended Sept. 30 .
wsj_2396	1	Tandem said it expects to report revenue of about $ 450 million and earnings of 35 cents to 40 cents a share .
wsj_2396	2	The results , which are in line with analysts ' estimates , reflect `` a continued improvement in our U.S. business , '' said James Treybig , Tandem 's chief executive officer .
wsj_2396	3	In the year-earlier period , Tandem reported net income of $ 30.1 million , or 31 cents a share , on revenue of $ 383.9 million .
wsj_2396	4	Tandem expects to report the full results for the quarter next week .
wsj_2396	5	Analysts have predicted that the Cupertino , Calif. , company will report revenue of $ 430 million to $ 460 million and earnings of 35 cents to 40 cents a share .
wsj_2396	6	Commenting on the results for the quarter , Mr. Treybig said the strength of the company 's domestic business came as `` a surprise '' to him , noting that sales `` in every region of the U.S. exceeded our plan . ''
wsj_2396	7	The company 's U.S. performance was helped by `` a record quarter for new customers , '' he said .
wsj_2396	8	Tandem makes `` fault-tolerant '' computers -- machines with built-in backup systems -- that run stock exchanges , networks of automatic tellers and other complex computer systems .
wsj_2396	9	Tomorrow the company is scheduled to announce its most powerful computer ever , which for the first time will bring it into direct competition with makers of mainframe computers .
wsj_2396	10	Tandem 's new high-end computer is called Cyclone .
wsj_2396	11	Prices for the machine , which can come in various configurations , are $ 2 million to $ 10 million .
wsj_2396	12	Analysts expect the new computer to wrest a hefty slice of business away from IBM , the longtime leader in mainframes .
wsj_2396	13	`` We believe they could siphon perhaps two to three billion dollars from IBM '' over the next few years , said George Weiss , an analyst at the Gartner group .
wsj_2396	14	That will spur Tandem 's growth .
wsj_2396	15	`` I 'd be disappointed if the company grew by less than 20 % next year , '' said John Levinson , an analyst at Goldman , Sachs & Co .
wsj_2396	16	IBM is expected to respond to Tandem 's Cyclone by discounting its own mainframes , which analysts say are roughly three times the price of a comparable system from Tandem .
wsj_2396	17	`` Obviously IBM can give bigger discounts to users immediately , '' said Mr. Weiss .
wsj_2396	18	But Mr. Treybig questions whether that will be enough to stop Tandem 's first mainframe from taking on some of the functions that large organizations previously sought from Big Blue 's machines .
wsj_2396	19	`` The answer is n't price reductions , but new systems , '' he said .
wsj_2396	20	Nevertheless , Tandem faces a variety of challenges , the biggest being that customers generally view the company 's computers as complementary to IBM 's mainframes .
wsj_2396	21	Even Mr. Treybig is reluctant to abandon this notion , insisting that Tandem 's new machines are n't replacements for IBM 's mainframes .
wsj_2396	22	`` We 're after a little bigger niche , '' he said .

wsj_2399	16	$ 200 million of stripped mortgage securities underwritten by BT Securities Corp .
wsj_2399	17	The agency 's first strips issue , collateralized by Freddie Mac 8 % securities pooled into a single security called a Giant , will be divided into interest-only and principal-only securities .

wsj_2399	20	The interest-only securities will be sold separately by BT Securities .
wsj_2399	21	The principal-only securities pay the principal from the underlying Freddie Mac 8 % securities , while the interest-only securities pay only interest .

wsj_2399	23	The interest-only securities were priced at 35 1/2 to yield 10.72 % .
wsj_2399	24	There were no major Eurobond or foreign bond offerings in Europe Friday .
wsj_2400	0	The economy 's temperature will be taken from several vantage points this week , with readings on trade , output , housing and inflation .
wsj_2400	1	The most troublesome report may be the August merchandise trade deficit due out tomorrow .
wsj_2400	2	The trade gap is expected to widen to about $ 9 billion from July 's $ 7.6 billion , according to a survey by MMS International , a unit of McGraw-Hill Inc. , New York .
wsj_2400	3	Thursday 's report on the September consumer price index is expected to rise , although not as sharply as the 0.9 % gain reported Friday in the producer price index .
wsj_2400	4	That gain was being cited as a reason the stock market was down early in Friday 's session , before it got started on its reckless 190-point plunge .
wsj_2400	5	Economists are divided as to how much manufacturing strength they expect to see in September reports on industrial production and capacity utilization , also due tomorrow .
wsj_2400	6	Meanwhile , September housing starts , due Wednesday , are thought to have inched upward .
wsj_2400	7	`` There 's a possibility of a surprise '' in the trade report , said Michael Englund , director of research at MMS .
wsj_2400	8	A widening of the deficit , if it were combined with a stubbornly strong dollar , would exacerbate trade problems -- but the dollar weakened Friday as stocks plummeted .
wsj_2400	9	In any event , Mr. Englund and many others say that the easy gains in narrowing the trade gap have already been made .
wsj_2400	10	`` Trade is definitely going to be more politically sensitive over the next six or seven months as improvement begins to slow , '' he said .
wsj_2400	11	Exports are thought to have risen strongly in August , but probably not enough to offset the jump in imports , economists said .
wsj_2400	12	Views on manufacturing strength are split between economists who read September 's low level of factory job growth as a sign of a slowdown and those who use the somewhat more comforting total employment figures in their calculations .
wsj_2400	13	The wide range of estimates for the industrial output number underscores the differences : The forecasts run from a drop of 0.5 % to an increase of 0.4 % , according to MMS .
wsj_2400	14	A rebound in energy prices , which helped push up the producer price index , is expected to do the same in the consumer price report .
wsj_2400	15	The consensus view expects a 0.4 % increase in the September CPI after a flat reading in August .
wsj_2400	16	Robert H. Chandross , an economist for Lloyd 's Bank in New York , is among those expecting a more moderate gain in the CPI than in prices at the producer level .
wsj_2400	17	`` Auto prices had a big effect in the PPI , and at the CPI level they wo n't , '' he said .
wsj_2400	18	Food prices are expected to be unchanged , but energy costs jumped as much as 4 % , said Gary Ciminero , economist at Fleet/Norstar Financial Group .
wsj_2400	19	He also says he thinks `` core inflation , '' which excludes the volatile food and energy prices , was strong last month .
wsj_2400	20	He expects a gain of as much as 0.5 % in core inflation after a summer of far smaller increases .
wsj_2400	21	Housing starts are expected to quicken a bit from August 's annual pace of 1,350,000 units .
wsj_2400	22	Economists say an August rebound in permits for multifamily units signaled an increase in September starts , though activity remains fairly modest by historical standards .

wsj_2403	0	Axa-Midi Assurances of France gave details of its financing plans for its proposed $ 4.5 billion acquisition of Farmers Group Inc. , in amended filings with insurance regulators in the nine U.S. states where Farmers operates .
wsj_2403	1	The proposed acquisition is part of Sir James Goldsmith 's unfriendly takeover attempt for B.A.T Industries PLC , the British tobacco , retailing , paper and financial services concern that is parent of Los Angeles-based Farmers .
wsj_2403	2	In an attempt to appease U.S. regulators ' concern over a Goldsmith acquisition of Farmers , Sir James in August agreed to sell Farmers to Axa if he is successful in acquiring B.A.T .
wsj_2403	3	As part of the agreement , Axa agreed to invest $ 1 billion in Hoylake Investments Ltd. , Sir James 's acquisition vehicle .
wsj_2403	4	Of the total $ 5.5 billion to be paid to Hoylake by Axa , about $ 1 billion will come from available resources of Axa 's parent , Axa-Midi Group , $ 2.25 billion will be in the form of notes issued by Axa , and the remaining $ 2.25 billion will be in long-term bank loans .
wsj_2403	5	In an interview Thursday , Claude Bebear , chairman and chief executive officer of Axa , said his group has already obtained assurances from a group of banks led by Cie . Financiere de Paribas that they can provide the loan portion of the financing .
wsj_2403	6	The other banking companies in the group are Credit Lyonnais , Societe Generale , BankAmerica Corp. and Citicorp , he said .
wsj_2403	7	Mr. Bebear said Axa-Midi Group has `` more than $ 2.5 billion of non-strategic assets that we can and will sell '' to help pay off debt from the acquisition .
wsj_2403	8	He said the assets to be sold would be `` non-insurance '' assets , including a beer company and a real estate firm , and would n't include any pieces of Farmers .
wsj_2403	9	`` We wo n't put any burden on Farmers , '' he said .
wsj_2403	10	The amended filings also point out that under a new agreement , Hoylake has an absolute obligation to sell Farmers to Axa upon an acquisition of B.A.T .
wsj_2403	11	`` We hope that with what we did , the regulators will not need to evaluate Hoylake , and they can directly look at the agreement with us , because Hoylake wo n't be an owner of Farmers at anytime , '' Mr. Bebear said .
wsj_2403	12	Any change of control in Farmers needs approval of the insurance commissioners in the nine states where Farmers and its related companies are incorporated .
wsj_2403	13	The amended filings were required because of the new agreement between Axa and Hoylake , and to reflect the extension that Sir James received last month under British takeover rules to complete his proposed acquisition .
wsj_2403	14	Hoylake dropped its initial # 13.35 billion $ 20.71 billion ) takeover bid after it received the extension , but said it would launch a new bid if and when the propsed sale of Farmers to Axa receives regulatory approval .
wsj_2403	15	A spokesman for B.A.T said of the amended filings that , `` It would appear that nothing substantive has changed .
wsj_2403	16	The new financing structure is still a very-highly leveraged one , and Axa still plans to take out 75 % of Farmers ' earnings as dividends to service their debt . ''
wsj_2403	17	That dividend is almost double the 35 % currently taken out of Farmers by B.A.T , the spokesman added .
wsj_2403	18	`` It would have severe implications for Farmers ' policy holders . ''
wsj_2403	19	To fend off Sir James 's advances , B.A.T has proposed a sweeping restructuring that would pare it to a tobacco and financial services concern .

wsj_2410	0	The inflation-adjusted growth rate for France 's gross domestic product for the second quarter was revised upward to 0.8 % from the previous three months from the initial estimate of 0.7 % , the National Statistics Institute said .
wsj_2410	1	The state agency said the latest revision left the growth rate for the first-quarter compared with the previous three months unchanged at 1.3 % .
wsj_2410	2	If the economy continues to expand by 0.8 % a quarter for the rest of the year , it would leave GDP growth for all of 1989 at 3 % , the institute said .

wsj_2416	1	The firm , which was acquired in April from Sears , Roebuck & Co. in a management-led buy-out , had planned to sell up to $ 56.4 million of stock , or a 50 % stake in the company , to its 5,000 employees .
wsj_2416	2	Though the offering did n't sell out , James J. Didion , chairman and chief executive officer , said , `` We 're pretty proud of the employees ' response . ''
wsj_2416	3	He noted that unlike an employee stock ownership plan , where a company usually borrows money from third party lenders to buy stock that it sets aside to award employees over time , here employees had to fork out their own cash for the stock .
wsj_2416	4	`` They came up with their own money instead of borrowed money , '' Mr. Didion said .
wsj_2416	5	`` It 's totally different . ''
wsj_2416	6	He said the offering was designed to create long-term incentives for employees .
wsj_2416	7	`` We 're in a service business , and in that context , it 's vital to have your employees involved in the ownership so they have a stake in the success . ''
wsj_2416	8	The brokerage firm wo n't pay a dividend on the stock .

wsj_2427	0	Striking auto workers ended their 19-day occupation of a metal shop at a Peugeot S.A. factory in eastern France Friday as pay talks got under way in the capital .
wsj_2427	1	But the Peugeot breakthrough came as a nationwide dispute by Finance Ministry employees disrupted border checkpoints and threatened the government 's ability to pay its bills .
wsj_2427	2	The Peugeot metalworkers began filing out of the shop , which makes auto parts , at the plant in Mulhouse after voting 589 to 193 to abandon the occupation .
wsj_2427	3	Their withdrawal was based on promises by Peugeot to open negotiations in Paris at the same time the last man left the premises .
wsj_2427	4	The strike by customs officers , tax collectors , treasury workers and other civil servants attached to the Ministry of Finance may pose a more serious challenge to the government and the average Frenchman .
wsj_2427	5	Ministry employees complain that they are poorly paid because of a complex job-rating system they say fails to take into account their education and level of technical expertise .
wsj_2428	0	The market for $ 200 billion of high-risk junk bonds , battered by a succession of defaults and huge price declines this year , practically vanished Friday .
wsj_2428	1	Trading ground to a halt as investors rushed to sell bonds , only to find themselves deserted by potential buyers .
wsj_2428	2	Stunned , they watched brokerage houses mark down price quotations on their junk holdings while being able to execute very few actual trades .
wsj_2428	3	`` The junk bond market is in a state of gridlock now -- there are no bids , only offers , '' says independent investor Martin D. Sass , who manages nearly $ 4 billion and who recently decided to buy distressed securities for a new fund .
wsj_2428	4	This calamity is `` far from over , '' he says .
wsj_2428	5	Junk 's collapse helped stoke the panicky selling of stocks that produced the deepest one-day dive in the Dow Jones Industrial Average since the Oct. 19 , 1987 , crash .
wsj_2428	6	Simultaneously , it also helped trigger this year 's biggest rally in the U.S. government bond market as investors rushed to move capital into the highest-quality securities they could find .
wsj_2428	7	But `` an eerie silence pervaded '' the junk market Friday as prices tumbled on hundreds of high-yield bonds despite `` no active trading , '' says John Lonski , an economist at Moody 's Investors Service Inc .
wsj_2428	8	For example , the price of Southland Corp. 's $ 500 million of 16 3/4 % bonds due 2002 -- sold less than two years ago by Goldman , Sachs & Co. -- plummeted 25 % to just 30 cents on the dollar .
wsj_2428	9	But not even Goldman would make a market in the securities of Southland , the owner of the nationwide chain of 7-11 convenience stores that is strapped for cash .
wsj_2428	10	Goldman officials declined to comment .
wsj_2428	11	Junk bonds , which mushroomed from less than $ 2 billion at the start of this decade , have been declining for months as issuer after issuer sank beneath the weight of hefty interest payments .
wsj_2428	12	The shaky market received its biggest jolt last month from Campeau Corp. , which created its U.S. retailing empire with junk financing .
wsj_2428	13	Campeau developed a cash squeeze that caused it to be tardy on some interest payments and to put its prestigious Bloomingdales department-store chain up for sale .
wsj_2428	14	Now , dozens of corporations , including Ethan Allen , TW Services and York International , that are counting on at least $ 7 billion of scheduled new junk financings to keep their highly leveraged takeovers and buy-outs afloat , may never get the money .
wsj_2428	15	`` The music has stopped playing , '' says Michael Harkins , a principal in the investment firm of Levy Harkins .
wsj_2428	16	`` You 've either got a chair or you do n't . ''
wsj_2428	17	In Friday 's aftermath , says R. Douglas Carleton , a director of high-yield finance at First Boston Corp. , `` much of the $ 7 billion forward calendar could be deferred , depending on the hysteria . ''
wsj_2428	18	In August , First Boston withdrew a $ 475 million junk offering of Ohio Mattress bonds because potential buyers were `` very skittish . ''
wsj_2428	19	The outlook `` looks shaky because we 're still waiting '' for mutual funds , in particular , to dump some of their junk bond holdings to pay off redemptions by individual investors , says King Penniman , senior vice president at McCarthy , Crisanti & Maffei , an investment arm of Xerox Financial Services .
wsj_2428	20	Indeed , a Moody 's index that tracks the net asset values of 24 high-yield mutual funds declined for the 17th consecutive day Friday .
wsj_2428	21	In a stark contrast , the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond climbed more than 2 1/2 points , or about $ 25 for each $ 1,000 face amount , to 103 12/32 , its biggest gain of the year .
wsj_2428	22	The bond 's yield dropped to 7.82 % , the lowest since March 31 , 1987 , according to Technical Data Global Markets Group .
wsj_2428	23	The yield on three-month Treasury bills , considered the safest of all investments , plummeted about 0.7 percentage point to 7.16 % , the largest one-day decline since 1982 .
wsj_2428	24	The main catalyst for government bond market rally was the 190.58-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average .
wsj_2428	25	`` When you get panic in one market , you get flight to quality in the other , '' said Maria Ramirez , money market economist at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc .
