2007_01_01_1815742	0	FOR years , Internet users have treated online photo services like a batch of holiday snapshots -- checking them out for a while , then letting them collect dust on the shelf as soon as something new comes along .
2007_01_01_1815742	1	Now Smilebox.com , a start-up based in Redmond , Wash. , is offering customers the opportunity to build online scrapbooks with animation , music and artwork .
2007_01_01_1815742	2	The kicker is that , in a market cluttered with free services that have struggled to produce profits , Smilebox is actually attracting paying customers .
2007_01_01_1815742	3	Smilebox.com users pay $ 1 or $ 2 to choose from among 350 graphic templates for their digital photos , or pay for a $ 5 monthly subscription for unlimited access to the templates .
2007_01_01_1815742	4	Those with dozens of holiday photos might choose to collect them in a virtual photo album with holiday themed artwork on the borders , for instance .
2007_01_01_1815742	5	Next , users can choose from among 700 musical selections to accompany the photo book , and decide on other visual flourishes , like animated transitions between pages .
2007_01_01_1815742	6	( Smilebox also offers a free version that includes advertisements and fewer music and template choices . )
2007_01_01_1815742	7	Unlike many other photo-sharing services , Smilebox does not require users to upload photos to the Web site and edit them there .
2007_01_01_1815742	8	Rather , since users download the template , they need only drag images to the desired locations on the template , then upload the entire file to the Web site .
2007_01_01_1815742	9	Smilebox then delivers e-mail messages to the user 's friends and family , inviting them to view the book .
2007_01_01_1815742	10	Should Smilebox gain enough acceptance with consumers before the free photo services offer up competing features , analysts said , it may well build a successful business .
2007_01_01_1815742	11	Building a successful business of any significant size , though , may be asking too much . ''
2007_01_01_1815742	12	This looks to me like a niche business , '' said Christopher Chute , an analyst with IDC , a technology consultancy . ''
2007_01_01_1815742	13	Getting people to pay has always been a problem , so they 've got to find a hook . ''
2007_01_01_1815742	14	Andrew Wright , the chief executive of Smilebox , believes he has found at least one hook into a bigger market , thanks to an alliance with Hallmark .
2007_01_01_1815742	15	In that partnership , the greeting card company in December started offering a modified version of Smilebox on Hallmark.com .
2007_01_01_1815742	16	According to Steven Ruschill , who oversees online initiatives for Hallmark 's new business development group , the Smilebox partnership has yielded '' pleasantly surprising '' results , despite his company 's having done nothing to promote the service . ''
2007_01_01_1815742	17	It 's a little too early to judge it fully , but so far so good , '' he said .
2007_01_01_1815742	18	Hallmark.com visitors who clicked on the Smilebox feature turned into paying customers more often than Mr. Ruschill anticipated , he said .
2007_01_01_1815742	19	If the number of paying customers reaches an undisclosed threshold over the next several months , he said , Hallmark will most likely retain the service on its site and continue to share the revenues with Smilebox . ''
2007_01_01_1815742	20	When the novelty starts to wear off , the question is whether users will just think of this as another thing they have to do , '' he said .
2007_01_01_1815742	21	Mr. Wright said that Smilebox.com 's traffic climbed steadily after the company introduced it in April , reaching about 500,000 visitors in December .
2007_01_01_1815742	22	He would not say how many of those visitors were paying customers , but he said , '' the business model is working very well . ''
2007_01_01_1815742	23	In addition to revenues from subscriptions and one-time sales , Smilebox is also distributing Google ads alongside its free photo templates , netting the company about $ 7 for each 1,000 people who view a page of pictures .
2007_01_01_1815742	24	Mr. Wright is , however , more focused on the fee-based service , having already built a successful subscription offering in the online games category which , like online photos , is dominated by free services .
2007_01_01_1815742	25	Mr. Wright formerly led RealNetworks ' RealArcade , and several former RealNetworks executives , among others , have backed his business with $ 6 million in venture financing to date .
2007_01_01_1815742	26	Mr. Wright 's fee-based approach is unusual , but not unique .
2007_01_01_1815742	27	Smugmug , a photo-sharing service based in San Francisco , charges $ 40 to $ 150 annually for digital photo storage and sharing .
2007_01_01_1815742	28	Chris MacAskill , Smugmug 's president , said the company is profitable , with slightly more than $ 10 million in annual sales , and spends nothing on marketing .
2007_01_01_1815742	29	He said Smilebox '' looks very interesting . '' ''
2007_01_01_1815742	30	I 've seen quite a few attempts at it in the past , '' Mr. MacAskill said , referring to digital scrapbooking , '' including a very impressive Sony site , Screenblast , that for some reason never got traction and went away .
2007_01_01_1815742	31	Surely someone will make it work , and these guys look like they 've got a lot of talent . ''
2007_01_01_1815742	32	The darling of free online photo-sharing , Photobucket.com , will introduce both free and paid services that will compete with Smilebox early in 2007 , said Alex Welch , the company 's chief executive .
2007_01_01_1815742	33	Mr. Welch said that service would let users create custom slideshows with audio . ''
2007_01_01_1815742	34	There 's definitely a huge hunger for online editing tools , '' Mr. Welch said . ''
2007_01_01_1815742	35	The question is whether you can charge for it and differentiate yourself enough to make a business out of it . ''
2007_01_01_1815742	36	Photobucket.com raced to the top of online photo-sharing sites in 2006 , reaching 15.6 million visitors in November , according to ComScore Media Metrix , an online measurement company .
2007_01_01_1815742	37	A year earlier the company attracted 10 million fewer visitors , but word quickly spread among MySpace users , among others , that Photobucket simplified the process of posting photos on that Web site and others , and an Internet star was born .
2007_01_01_1815742	38	Now Mr. Welch said that even as it develops new features to keep pace with Smilebox and others , it is working harder to generate advertising revenue from visitors .
2007_01_01_1815742	39	The business recently created its own advertising sales team to strike deals with big brand marketers and advertising agencies .
2007_01_01_1815742	40	Until now , the company has distributed ads on behalf of Google and other networks , an effort that Mr. Welch said '' has worked well . ''
2007_01_01_1815742	41	If Photobucket , Smilebox and similar services generate significant profits from ads or user fees , IDC 's Mr. Chute , for one , will be surprised . ''
2007_01_01_1815742	42	The lack of a clear revenue model has always been the bane of these sites , '' Mr. Chute said . ''
2007_01_01_1815742	43	The only way these guys have ever made money was to be acquired . ''
2007_01_01_1815747	0	When it comes to spectacle , Hollywood enjoys nothing better than a nasty legal battle between two determined and egotistical adversaries : Bette Davis meets Joan Crawford , in a courtroom .
2007_01_01_1815747	1	In the past such face-offs have featured prominent figures like the former Disney chairman Michael D. Eisner , the DreamWorks co-founder Jeffrey Katzenberg , the superagent Michael S. Ovitz , the humorist Art Buchwald and the actress-writer Joan Collins .
2007_01_01_1815747	2	Many of them cringed to hear their private comments and inner thoughts offered up for public consumption .
2007_01_01_1815747	3	And so may it go if the headline-making book publisher Judith Regan proceeds with a lawsuit her lawyers have threatened against the News Corporation , which owns HarperCollins , the publishing house that fired her in December after the O. J. Simpson book and television project imploded .
2007_01_01_1815747	4	In an interview last week Ms. Regan 's lawyer , Bert Fields , said he was preparing to file a lawsuit for libel and wrongful termination against the News Corporation shortly after the New Year because of allegations that she had been fired after making anti-Semitic remarks during a heated phone conversation with a company lawyer . ''
2007_01_01_1815747	5	My present thought is that we would sue not just for breach of contract but for libel , '' he said . ''
2007_01_01_1815747	6	They issued false and defamatory statements about Judith .
2007_01_01_1815747	7	This has been terribly destructive to her career , and I think the damages could be huge . ''
2007_01_01_1815747	8	A News Corporation spokesman declined to comment officially because the matter involved an imminent lawsuit , but he provided what he said was the company view : the News Corporation was confident about its case and not worried that a third party , a temporary worker who was briefly Ms. Regan 's assistant , had emerged to support Ms. Regan 's account of the conversation that led to the dismissal . ''
2007_01_01_1815747	9	We 're very confident that what we said is not false , '' said the company executive , who added that the News Corporation chairman , Rupert Murdoch , was taking an active interest in the matter . ''
2007_01_01_1815747	10	But this seems to be heading more toward a public relations war than a litigation . ''
2007_01_01_1815747	11	Well , naturally so .
2007_01_01_1815747	12	In Hollywood battles a war of words often precedes legal formalities , and Mr. Fields has plenty of experience .
2007_01_01_1815747	13	He has played legal counselor in headline-grabbing cases like Mr. Katzenberg versus the Walt Disney Company in the mid-1990s , and two Tom Cruise defamation cases , in Britain in 1998 and in California in 2003 , both over allegations that he was homosexual .
2007_01_01_1815747	14	In those instances Mr. Katzenberg and Mr. Cruise got satisfaction , either financial or legal , although they had to suffer through headlines that , in Mr. Cruise 's case , repeated the unsupported allegations and , in Mr. Katzenberg 's case , unearthed a nasty remark about his diminutive height .
2007_01_01_1815747	15	But a case involving Ms. Regan may well prove to be uglier and more prurient .
2007_01_01_1815747	16	Legal scholars and prominent litigators said that proving libel is extremely difficult , but it opens the door to a public airing of the litigants ' private affairs . ''
2007_01_01_1815747	17	Libel is a very , very high mountain of proof to climb , and you can get destroyed in the process , '' said Pierce O'Donnell , a leading litigator who successfully sued Paramount in the 1980s for Mr. Buchwald , who contended that the studio had stolen his screenplay idea in its movie '' Coming to America . ''
2007_01_01_1815747	18	Ms. Regan , whose lively personal life is already well-worn fodder for tabloid gossip , will find lawyers poring over every off-color remark she may have made , Mr. O'Donnell said .
2007_01_01_1815747	19	Former colleagues have already emerged to confirm that she was reprimanded in the past for making an anti-Semitic remark at work .
2007_01_01_1815747	20	Mr. O'Donnell said : '' She will open herself up to every scurrilous allegation .
2007_01_01_1815747	21	She will not enjoy one minute of this litigation .
2007_01_01_1815747	22	They 'll hire a bulldog , and it 'll be a bloodletting . ''
2007_01_01_1815747	23	Meanwhile HarperCollins , which owns ReganBooks , would probably face uncomfortable questions about why it tolerated Ms. Regan for so long if the company found her behavior so objectionable .
2007_01_01_1815747	24	And executives would also have to submit to a detailed examination of their decision-making process in the Simpson project , a book titled '' If I Did It '' and a television interview conducted by Ms. Regan , which unleashed such a cascade of public outrage that both were canceled . ''
2007_01_01_1815747	25	Everything that went on will get into evidence , '' Mr. Fields promised . ''
2007_01_01_1815747	26	What really happened with that interview , what Jane Friedman , '' the president of HarperCollins and Ms. Regan 's former boss , '' is really like . ''
2007_01_01_1815747	27	A significant issue for a jury , Mr. O'Donnell said , would be whether the accusations of anti-Semitism were merely a pretext for getting rid of the controversial publisher .
2007_01_01_1815747	28	HarperCollins '' may say that this was the straw that broke the camel 's back , but the other side may say the straw was really the embarrassment over O. J. , '' he said .
2007_01_01_1815747	29	The breach-of-contract matter might be considered a garden-variety case , except for the accusation of anti-Semitism .
2007_01_01_1815747	30	With four years remaining on her contract , Ms. Regan would have been paid several million dollars had she not been fired for cause , a general term that usually includes behavior like dishonesty , failure to carry out orders or sexual harassment .
2007_01_01_1815747	31	But the charge of anti-Semitism itself is not a clear-cut one for either side , legal experts said .
2007_01_01_1815747	32	In its termination letter News Corporation did not specify the reason for Ms. Regan 's dismissal , though the company did later release its account of the allegedly anti-Semitic remarks to the news media .
2007_01_01_1815747	33	Mr. Fields said he planned to argue that a HarperCollins lawyer , Mark Jackson , knew that Ms. Regan never said that a '' Jewish cabal '' was in league against her during that phone conversation . ''
2007_01_01_1815747	34	He stated it , knowing it was false , '' Mr. Fields said . ''
2007_01_01_1815747	35	These days people do n't want much to do with an anti-Semite or an anti-black person . ''
2007_01_01_1815747	36	Others said it was more complicated . ''
2007_01_01_1815747	37	It really is a he said-she said , '' said Alan R. Friedman , a leading New York entertainment lawyer . ''
2007_01_01_1815747	38	Both sides have their reasons .
2007_01_01_1815747	39	Both witnesses have reason to be less than objective .
2007_01_01_1815747	40	And you have to show that it has an impact on her reputation .
2007_01_01_1815747	41	Will this really change anyone 's opinion of Judith Regan , a ` Jewish cabal ' ?
2007_01_01_1815747	42	This is n't like denying that the Holocaust occurred .
2007_01_01_1815747	43	That 's just a burden . ''
2007_01_01_1815747	44	David R. Ginsburg , who is executive director of the entertainment law program at the University of California , Los Angeles , said that if a jury believed she made the remark , it would be a basis for firing . ''
2007_01_01_1815747	45	Taking it in the abstract , it is damaging for a company to take no action while a senior executive purportedly makes anti-Semitic remarks , '' he said .
2007_01_01_1815747	46	Several lawyers said they imagined that the matter would never have received this much attention if not for the furor over O. J. Simpson .
2007_01_01_1815747	47	And they said they believed it would be settled quietly once the media noise died down because the negative implications for both sides were so great .
2007_01_01_1815747	48	On the eve of the new year there were indications that a window might open toward conciliation .
2007_01_01_1815747	49	Mr. Fields suggested an apology : '' In my view they should retract what they said .
2007_01_01_1815747	50	If they did , it might limit the damages .
2007_01_01_1815747	51	We 'd still sue for breach of contract , but we might not sue for libel . ''
2007_01_01_1815747	52	The News Corporation executive said the company would prefer to settle the matter quietly . ''
2007_01_01_1815747	53	We 'd like this to go away quickly , amicably and professionally , '' he said . ''
2007_01_01_1815747	54	We 're not going to settle at any price .
2007_01_01_1815747	55	We have a very strong case .
2007_01_01_1815747	56	But having the winning case does n't mean you want to go to court . ''
2007_01_01_1815748	0	Peaceful Protest at ` Idomeneo ' About 20 Muslims protested peacefully outside the Deutsche Oper in Berlin when it presented the second performance of its production of Mozart 's '' Idomeneo , '' canceled in November out of fears arising from a scene showing the severed head of the Prophet Muhammad , The Associated Press reported .
2007_01_01_1815748	1	At the protest on Friday the demonstrators , above , prayed and displayed a green Islamic banner inscribed in Arabic with what they said was a Muslim expression of faith . ''
2007_01_01_1815748	2	Islam is for freedom , but we are against this insult , '' said Yusuf Oezgoez , a Turkish-born resident of Berlin .
2007_01_01_1815748	3	Marcel Kuhlmey , a Berlin police spokesman , said , '' There have been absolutely no threats , nothing . ''
2007_01_01_1815748	4	Spectators greeted the controversial scene , including the severed heads of Jesus , Buddha and the pagan sea god Poseidon , with applause , and one woman laughed .
2007_01_01_1815748	5	In contrast to a near sellout for the first performance , on Dec. 18 , 1,355 tickets out of a possible total of more than 1,800 were sold for the second .
2007_01_01_1815748	6	Moretti Quits Turin Festival Two days after being named artistic director of the Turin Film Festival , the Italian director Nanni Moretti quit , The Associated Press reported .
2007_01_01_1815748	7	Quoting a statement carried by the Italian news agency ANSA , it said that Mr. Moretti , left , had cited '' an atmosphere of tension '' that arose when some festival organizers objected after he was chosen on Wednesday .
2007_01_01_1815748	8	Mr. Moretti said , '' There has been talk of organizing two competing festivals in the same city ; someone suggested a lack of ethics ; and some have even said that I would be an instrument for politicians to strangle the festival 's independence . ''
2007_01_01_1815748	9	He continued , '' With great pain I give up the job and leave you to your method problems , procedural disputes , personal grudges . ''
2007_01_01_1815748	10	Organizers could not be reached for immediate comment .
2007_01_01_1815748	11	The appointment of Mr. Moretti , who won the Palme d'Or at Cannes in 2001 for '' The Son 's Room , '' had been seen as a move to invigorate the Turin festival , which spotlights young directors and independent films from around the world .

2007_01_01_1815751	0	Gov ' t Mule played two Beatles songs as encores at the Beacon Theater on Friday night .
2007_01_01_1815751	1	Earlier in the show the band covered Cream , Jimi Hendrix , Willie Dixon ( by way of Howlin ' Wolf ) and Little Milton ( via Jerry Garcia ) .
2007_01_01_1815751	2	A James Brown jam was offered in tribute .
2007_01_01_1815751	3	A Stevie Wonder vamp cropped up in a Mahavishnu Orchestra tune .
2007_01_01_1815751	4	And during John Fogerty 's '' Effigy '' there were quotations of Johnny Cash songs .
2007_01_01_1815751	5	That clutter of references does a decent job of summing up Gov ' t Mule , a jam band with more than a casual investment in classic rock , soul and the blues .
2007_01_01_1815751	6	The Friday concert , the first in a three-night run , was typical : a seesaw of dense , hard riffs and rambling digressions .
2007_01_01_1815751	7	Along the way there was room for original tunes spanning the group 's 11-year recording career .
2007_01_01_1815751	8	( It helps that the concert lasted well over three hours . )
2007_01_01_1815751	9	The originals -- and , for that matter , the array of influences -- came courtesy of Warren Haynes , Gov ' t Mule 's lead singer and guitarist .
2007_01_01_1815751	10	Mr. Haynes hails from a Southern-rock tradition of shaggy virtuosity .
2007_01_01_1815751	11	And as he regularly does as a guitarist in the Allman Brothers Band , which has also been known to set up shop at the Beacon , he galvanized .
2007_01_01_1815751	12	It was unmistakably his show , despite the reliable cohesion of his band .
2007_01_01_1815751	13	As a singer he makes ample use of a bluesy rasp , flexing it to fit whatever dynamic the music demands .
2007_01_01_1815751	14	So he was convincingly sweet-tempered on '' Hide Your Love Away , '' one of the Beatles songs .
2007_01_01_1815751	15	Elsewhere he mostly howled .
2007_01_01_1815751	16	On '' Brand New Angel , '' a psychedelic tune from '' High and Mighty , '' Gov ' t Mule 's latest album , his harnessed rage made the chorus sound like something by Soundgarden .
2007_01_01_1815751	17	Then came '' Mr. High & Mighty , '' the album 's lead track : the juicy hard-rock riff , coupled with a strained vocal , evoked vintage AC/DC .
2007_01_01_1815751	18	It 's probably not a good thing that the originals were n't much more original than the covers , but Mr. Haynes made that seem forgivable .
2007_01_01_1815751	19	The guitar playing helped .
2007_01_01_1815751	20	Most of his solos evolved from choice single notes to an ecstatic strumming wail , producing a sense of tension and drama .
2007_01_01_1815751	21	And his rapport with the drummer Matt Abts , the keyboardist Danny Louis and the bassist Andy Hess felt rewardingly deep .
2007_01_01_1815751	22	But because Mr. Haynes went long on every tune , tedium occasionally set in .
2007_01_01_1815751	23	So it was a relief when Mr. Haynes brought on other guitarists as foils : the versatile Jimmy Vivino on several tunes , as well as Cesar Rojas and David Hidalgo , both members of the veteran Los Angeles band Los Lobos .
2007_01_01_1815751	24	Nobody posed a serious challenge to Mr. Haynes , but they all nudged him in productive ways .
2007_01_01_1815751	25	As an opener Los Lobos provided an interesting contrast to Gov ' t Mule .
2007_01_01_1815751	26	Los Lobos drew heavily from their recent album '' The Town and the City '' and leaned on a smoldering sort of atmosphere .
2007_01_01_1815751	27	Mr. Hidalgo and Mr. Rojas took turns soloing and singing ; there was no obvious star in the ranks .
2007_01_01_1815751	28	Los Lobos ' set was far less dynamic than Gov ' t Mule 's , and not nearly as free-flowing .
2007_01_01_1815751	29	But as the irresistible groove of '' Chuco 's Cumbia '' segued into the sinuous meditation of '' The Valley , '' a nifty spell was cast .
2007_01_01_1815751	30	Los Lobos had a perspective , and a sound , to call its own .
2007_01_01_1815751	31	Then again they seemed to have the most fun on a cover of Buddy Holly 's '' Not Fade Away . ''
2007_01_01_1815751	32	And that was after Mr. Haynes had joined them onstage .
2007_01_01_1815751	33	MUSIC REVIEW Correction : January 9 , 2007 , Tuesday A music review on Jan. 1 about Gov ' t Mule and Los Lobos , at the Beacon Theater , misstated the surname of a member of Los Lobos .
2007_01_01_1815751	34	He is Cesar Rosas , not Rojas .
2007_01_01_1815752	0	The Misunderstood Jew The Church and the Scandal of the Jewish Jesus By Amy-Jill Levine 250 pages .
2007_01_01_1815752	1	As a child Amy-Jill Levine insisted on attending catechism class at a Catholic church .
2007_01_01_1815752	2	She faithfully administered Holy Communion to her Barbie doll .
2007_01_01_1815752	3	This , despite being , then as now , an observant Jew .
2007_01_01_1815752	4	A professor of New Testament studies at Vanderbilt Divinity School , Ms. Levine has spent a lifetime exploring the profound connections and equally profound divisions between Christianity and Judaism -- and , perhaps more important , between Christians and Jews .
2007_01_01_1815752	5	The premise of '' The Misunderstood Jew : The Church and the Scandal of the Jewish Jesus '' is simple : Jews and Christians need to understand one another .
2007_01_01_1815752	6	The implicit corollary : Despite years of trying , and to their mutual harm , they do not .
2007_01_01_1815752	7	In a book intended for Jews and Christians alike ( but mostly addressed to Christians ) Ms. Levine offers both critique and corrective on topics as seemingly disparate as the Jewish content of the Lord 's Prayer and Christian responses to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict .
2007_01_01_1815752	8	But that is Ms. Levine 's point : to show how frequently and disastrously inaccurate beliefs about Jesus and early Judaism produce distorted relationships in the present .
2007_01_01_1815752	9	Her first chapters , devoted to the Jewish Jesus and the New Testament , are the least satisfying .
2007_01_01_1815752	10	In the interests of educating her reader about Judaism in both the first century and the 21st , she moves somewhat erratically between the two eras .
2007_01_01_1815752	11	A discussion of Jesus ' views on the Sabbath begins with a modern Jewish view of the Sabbath before considering the roots of this view in the Torah , and she discusses how the Christian celebration of Sabbath on Sunday rather than Saturday changes its symbolic import , before returning to Jesus and his first-century context .
2007_01_01_1815752	12	The information is valuable but might be more edifying , especially for the nonspecialists who form the book 's primary audience , if the shifting time frame were less distracting .
2007_01_01_1815752	13	Ms. Levine 's reconstructions of first-century Judaism are corrective in some places but elsewhere simply repeat unhelpful truisms .
2007_01_01_1815752	14	For example , she uncritically takes rabbinic writings as representing the '' majority '' view among first-century Jews , despite growing scholarly rejection of this stance .
2007_01_01_1815752	15	Similarly , Paul 's belief that Jesus ' blood atoned for human sin is described as unprecedented and '' off-putting '' for Jews .
2007_01_01_1815752	16	Certainly , blood atonement is off-putting for most modern Jews , but in some ancient Jewish contexts it was standard fare , as evidenced by repeated claims in 2 and 4 Maccabees that the blood of Jewish martyrs atoned for the sins of the people .
2007_01_01_1815752	17	Ms. Levine 's perpetuation of some anachronistic readings , however , confirms her larger point : Our received assumptions about what Jesus ( and Paul ) meant in their original settings are deeply entrenched , often serving agendas of which we are not even aware .
2007_01_01_1815752	18	She is on a surer footing when she addresses the question of anti-Judaism within the New Testament .
2007_01_01_1815752	19	Three extremely painful texts -- 1 Thessalonians 2:14 -15 , with its claim that the Jews killed Jesus ; Matthew 27:25 , in which the Jews call for Jesus ' blood upon themselves and their children ; and John 8:44 , in which Jesus labels the Jews '' children of the Devil '' -- suffice to demonstrate that regardless of authorial intent or historical context , the plain meaning of the New Testament is often virulently anti-Jewish .
2007_01_01_1815752	20	In such instances historical context becomes irrelevant ; the problem will not be solved by more or better scholarship .
2007_01_01_1815752	21	Rather , the problem can be addressed only by those who read these texts as Scripture : '' Christians must denounce anti-Jewish readings . ''
2007_01_01_1815752	22	What Ms. Levine finds , however , is that even theologically educated and well-meaning Christians frequently do n't denounce such readings , but instead either deny their anti-Jewish content ( here the Pontifical Biblical Commission comes in for special criticism ) or , often unwittingly , replicate it .
2007_01_01_1815752	23	Ms. Levine 's documentation of the insouciance with which liberal Christians slander Jews and Judaism is perhaps the book 's most important contribution .
2007_01_01_1815752	24	She cites numerous examples of contemporary scholars , particularly theologians of liberation , who first '' invent a bad Judaism '' and then '' explain how Jesus abrogates this bad system . ''
2007_01_01_1815752	25	In her most outrageous example , Jesus ' crucifixion is said to mark the '' triumph of the patriarchal god of Judaism . ''
2007_01_01_1815752	26	Many of the works Ms. Levine cites were published by the World Council of Churches , a group committed to overcoming anti-Semitism .
2007_01_01_1815752	27	How can well-meaning Christians perpetuate such theological abomination ?
2007_01_01_1815752	28	Mostly , argues Ms. Levine , through sloppy scholarship and lazy reading .
2007_01_01_1815752	29	Christian seminarians are taught little about Judaism , either ancient or modern ( Judaism does not count as a '' different '' tradition in many programs that require study of a non-Christian tradition ) , and so look to the only '' Jews '' available -- the Israelites of the Old Testament -- for a model of what Jews do and believe .
2007_01_01_1815752	30	First-century Jews are seen either as figures transplanted from the Old Testament or as practitioners of a '' late Judaism '' that has corrupted Old Testament ideals .
2007_01_01_1815752	31	Modern Jews , in turn , embody the already-fossilized religion practiced by Jesus ' first-century enemies .
2007_01_01_1815752	32	Within this limited horizon Jesus can only be defined against the Judaism of his day rather than within it .
2007_01_01_1815752	33	Hence Ms. Levine 's concern '' to see Jesus as a Jew who made sense to other Jews in a Jewish context , '' ultimately allowing him to become '' a bridge , '' spanning the gap between modern Jews and Christians .
2007_01_01_1815752	34	Jewish-Christian dialogue , having come into its own in the aftermath of the Holocaust , has seemed less compelling in recent decades .
2007_01_01_1815752	35	Ms. Levine 's chilling tales of casual anti-Judaism among scholars who should know better rekindles the urgency of the task .
2007_01_01_1815752	36	She covers a vast canvas and of necessity does so in broad strokes , some more effective than others .
2007_01_01_1815752	37	But it is a book whose strengths far outweigh its flaws , and whose flaws count only because its subject matters so deeply .
2007_01_01_1815752	38	BOOKS OF THE TIMES Julie Galambush is associate professor of religious studies at the College of William and Mary .
2007_01_01_1815753	0	PRESIDENTIAL HONORS -- Markets are closed Monday for the New Year 's holiday , and most will remain closed Tuesday for the national day of mourning for former President Gerald R. Ford .
2007_01_01_1815753	1	The bond markets will be open only until 2 p.m. .
2007_01_01_1815753	2	Mr. Ford 's funeral will be held Tuesday , and he will be buried Wednesday in his hometown , Grand Rapids , Mich. .
2007_01_01_1815753	3	RETAIL SNAPSHOT -- Last month brought ample news of consumer demand for video game players , flat-screen televisions and Elmo T.M.X. dolls , but retailers have yet to announce how bountiful the holiday season was for them .
2007_01_01_1815753	4	That uncertainty will be resolved when many big retail chains report their sales results for December ( Thursday ) .
2007_01_01_1815753	5	PLENTY OF NUMBERS -- Although the shortened trading week may lead to low transaction volumes , there will be a good amount of economic data for the markets to digest .
2007_01_01_1815753	6	The Labor Department will release its unemployment report for December ( Friday ) , with the rate expected to remain at 4.5 percent .
2007_01_01_1815753	7	Automakers will report December vehicle sales ( Wednesday ) .
2007_01_01_1815753	8	Other reports : November construction spending and the Institute for Supply Management report on manufacturing for December ( Wednesday ) , and November factory orders and the I.S.M. report on services for December ( Thursday ) .
2007_01_01_1815753	9	FED WATCH -- The Federal Reserve will release minutes from its Dec. 12 Federal Open Market Committee meeting , which will be examined for hints about where it thinks inflation is going ( Wednesday ) .
2007_01_01_1815753	10	And Ben S. Bernanke ( above ) , chairman of the Federal Reserve , will speak on central banking and bank supervision at a luncheon in Chicago sponsored by the American Economic Association and the American Finance Association ( Friday ) .
2007_01_01_1815755	0	Cosmetics and health-care products were the items most likely to be shoplifted in 2000 , according to a report on supermarket theft recently issued by the Food Marketing Institute , a trade group .
2007_01_01_1815755	1	Last year , they were the third most shoplifted category , after meat and analgesics .
2007_01_01_1815755	2	The decline partly reflects increased security for pseudoephedrine , a decongestant that can be used to make the drug methamphetamine .
2007_01_01_1815755	3	By the end of 2005 , 34 states had passed laws restricting sales of medicines with the chemical , and often requiring stores to keep them under lock and key .
2007_01_01_1815755	4	The report also suggested that self-service checkout lanes , where customers scan and pay for their purchases themselves , are surprisingly theft-free .
2007_01_01_1815755	5	Of the roughly 5,400 stores in the survey with self-checkout lanes , 63.6 percent reported no increase in theft rates . ''
2007_01_01_1815755	6	Individuals in the self-checkout lane , they think they 're being watched more than ever before , and they probably are , '' said Wayne Breckenridge , director of education for the Food Marketing Institute .
2007_01_01_1815756	0	Last year 's debut of Howard Stern 's radio show on Sirius Satellite Radio put the technology on the map , raising the public 's awareness of satellite radio and helping to boost significantly subscriber totals for Sirius and its larger rival , XM Satellite Radio .
2007_01_01_1815756	1	Today , thanks in part to the outsize radio personality , the Stern Effect has increased Sirius 's base to about six million subscribers , up 80 percent from one year ago .
2007_01_01_1815756	2	XM has increased its numbers by more than 30 percent , ending 2006 with 7.7 to 7.9 million customers . ''
2007_01_01_1815756	3	There is a tendency to view satellite radio as if the glass is half empty , and that it is a failure or disappointment , '' said Craig Moffett , senior cable analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein . ''
2007_01_01_1815756	4	In fact , nothing could be further from the truth , '' he said . ''
2007_01_01_1815756	5	Satellite radio is growing faster than any consumer product except for the iPod . ''
2007_01_01_1815756	6	But Sirius and XM shares have taken a battering on Wall Street , with prices for both off about 50 percent from their year-ago levels .
2007_01_01_1815756	7	On Friday , Sirius closed at $ 3.54 , while XM ended the year at $ 14.45 .
2007_01_01_1815756	8	And now , the industry may be getting ready to try an even more dramatic third act -- a possible attempt to merge the two services .
2007_01_01_1815756	9	The benefits of a merger have been promoted by the chief executive of Sirius , Mel Karmazin , for a number of months , and Sirius officials continue to say that a merger would be a good thing .
2007_01_01_1815756	10	XM has not commented on the possibility , and neither company has said whether they have actually discussed the issue . ''
2007_01_01_1815756	11	When you have two companies in the same industry , we have a similar cost structure .
2007_01_01_1815756	12	Clearly , a merger makes sense from an investor 's point of view to reduce costs , and to have a better return , '' said David Frear , the chief financial officer for Sirius .
2007_01_01_1815756	13	Both companies have continued to lose hundreds of millions of dollars because of marketing and other subscriber acquisition expenses .
2007_01_01_1815756	14	During the year , XM sharply lowered its expectations for 2006 subscriber levels , from January 's predicted end-of-year total of 9 million to a maximum of 7.9 million .
2007_01_01_1815756	15	( Sirius reduced its subscription projection by about 100,000 . )
2007_01_01_1815756	16	Nate Davis , XM 's president , said his company believed that the slower-than-expected growth rate was of its own making and not a result of any market indifference . ''
2007_01_01_1815756	17	We did not stimulate the market with new products , '' he said .
2007_01_01_1815756	18	XM 's most talked-about receivers , the Pioneer Inno and Samsung Helix , were first announced one year ago .
2007_01_01_1815756	19	Several new receiver models will be introduced later in 2007 .
2007_01_01_1815756	20	In addition , production of some receivers was temporarily halted to stop a condition that was allowing satellite signals to be picked up by neighboring vehicles .
2007_01_01_1815756	21	The hiccups typical of fledgling industries appear to be over .
2007_01_01_1815756	22	Both companies have their programming lineups largely in place and a wide range of receivers available in retail stores .
2007_01_01_1815756	23	In addition to Howard Stern , Sirius features personalities like Deepak Chopra , Judith Regan , Richard Simmons and Martha Stewart .
2007_01_01_1815756	24	Sports programming includes N.B.A. , N.F.L. , and N.H.L. games ; Nascar programming begins this year .
2007_01_01_1815756	25	XM has shows with hosts including Bob Dylan , Ellen Degeneres , '' Good Morning America '' personalities , and Oprah Winfrey .
2007_01_01_1815756	26	XM broadcasts every Major League Baseball game as well as P.G.A. golf .
2007_01_01_1815756	27	Yet the vast majority of programming remains duplicative .
2007_01_01_1815756	28	Each company offers a wide variety of rock , pop , folk , and other musical genres , as well as the same news channels , which include the BBC , CNN , Fox , and MSNBC .
2007_01_01_1815756	29	Sirius and XM each claim that their music channels are more compelling than the competition 's , but most casual listeners would be hard-pressed to tell the difference . ''
2007_01_01_1815756	30	The services mirror each other tremendously , '' said Richard Doherty , an analyst with the Envisioneering Group , a research firm . ''
2007_01_01_1815756	31	More people know that one service has Howard Stern than know which one has him . ''
2007_01_01_1815756	32	Except for a relatively small handful of viewers looking for particular programs , consumers searching for a satellite service in a retail store often make their decision not on the merits of one over the other , but which one is more convenient to buy . ''
2007_01_01_1815756	33	For the subscriber , it all comes down to which one of the two is closer to the cash register .
2007_01_01_1815756	34	Customers can not tell the difference between the two services , '' Mr. Moffett said .
2007_01_01_1815756	35	Customer choice will play an even smaller role in the coming years as both companies come to rely more on selling satellite radio as a factory-installed option on new cars , and less on receivers sold at retail stores .
2007_01_01_1815756	36	Both companies have exclusive agreements with the automobile companies .
2007_01_01_1815756	37	Customers typically get free service for a number of months , and then must pay $ 12.95 a month to continue listening .
2007_01_01_1815756	38	XM has exclusive arrangements with General Motors , Honda , Hyundai , Nissan and Porsche .
2007_01_01_1815756	39	Sirius has similar alliances with BMW , DaimlerChrysler , Ford , Kia and VW-Audi .
2007_01_01_1815756	40	Today , about 63 percent of XM 's subscribers are buyers of new cars , and Sirius 's new subscribers are derived equally from new car and after-market sales .
2007_01_01_1815756	41	As more cars are equipped with satellite radios , the new car market could grow to as high as 70 percent of sales in the next few years , Mr. Moffett said . ''
2007_01_01_1815756	42	We see greater and greater demand in the car market , '' said Mr. Davis of XM . ''
2007_01_01_1815756	43	And we think the used car market will be an opportunity to sell to new subscribers . ''
2007_01_01_1815756	44	Used car subscribers incur no additional hardware costs if the receiver is already in place .
2007_01_01_1815756	45	And if the companies were to merge and effectively double their subscriber base , the new company could reduce programming costs through increased negotiating clout , removal of duplicative channels and elimination of redundant employees .
2007_01_01_1815756	46	Whether Sirius and XM attempt to merge , a number of variables that will determine the size of the industry 's success remain unknown .
2007_01_01_1815756	47	They include the number of new cars that will be equipped with satellite radio receivers ; the percentage of new car owners who will subscribe after the free trial period ends ; and whether purchasers of used cars equipped with satellite radio will be more or less likely to subscribe than new car owners .
2007_01_01_1815756	48	The business may also be vulnerable to subscription overload , Mr. Doherty said , if consumers find that monthly recurring expenses from cellphone bills , cable TV , and other services are too high .
2007_01_01_1815756	49	Yet even if that is true , there is little doubt that the concept of satellite radio is no longer alien to consumers .
2007_01_01_1815756	50	According to Sirius , 83 percent of consumers aged 18 to 55 are now aware of the technology .
2007_01_01_1815756	51	Mr. Frear became personally cognizant of that when he tried to rent a car with a Sirius radio recently but found they were all taken . ''
2007_01_01_1815756	52	Every year , satellite radio just sinks deeper and deeper into the public consciousness , '' he said .
2007_01_01_1815756	53	Correction : January 16 , 2007 , Tuesday An article in Business Day on Jan. 1 about the increase in subscribers for Sirius Satellite Radio and its rival , XM Satellite Radio , misstated one news channel that is offered by both companies .
2007_01_01_1815756	54	It is CNBC , not MSNBC .
2007_01_01_1815757	0	The business of grain marketing has not been its usual sleepy self lately in Western Canada .
2007_01_01_1815757	1	Plans by the government to strip the Canadian Wheat Board of its monopoly control over most of the country 's wheat and barley exports have provoked a fight that is pitting farmer against farmer and the agency against the government .
2007_01_01_1815757	2	The wheat board , founded 75 years ago as part of a wave of cooperative ventures for improving farmers ' lives , is now one of the world 's largest grain traders , with annual sales of $ 4 billion to $ 6 billion .
2007_01_01_1815757	3	The board is , in many respects , among the last of the cooperative projects that remains true to its original goals .
2007_01_01_1815757	4	But those goals now have little in common with the open market philosophy of the minority Conservative government that came to power just under a year ago .
2007_01_01_1815757	5	Shortly before Christmas , that clash resulted in an unusual cabinet order to fire the wheat board 's president , Adrian Measner .
2007_01_01_1815757	6	The fate of the board will be eagerly awaited in the United States , where farm groups have unsuccessfully challenged the Canadian board 's monopoly .
2007_01_01_1815757	7	Among the companies likely to move into Canada 's export market , if it is opened , are commercial grain traders like Cargill of Minneapolis and Archer Daniels Midland of Decatur , Ill. '' There is absolutely no doubt that part of the reason the Conservative government is pushing as hard as it is pushing is , I suspect , that they are feeling pressure from the Americans , '' said Murray Fulton , an agriculture economist who directs a center for the study of cooperatives at the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon .
2007_01_01_1815757	8	The wheat board concept is simple .
2007_01_01_1815757	9	In exchange for its monopoly over wheat destined for export from Canada 's three prairie provinces , as well as a small part of British Columbia , it pays every farmer the same average sale price .
2007_01_01_1815757	10	Overall , Professor Fulton said , price averaging has provided most farmers with greater stability and higher prices than they would have obtained in an open market .
2007_01_01_1815757	11	A study commissioned by the wheat board on barley prices released in December gives more specifics .
2007_01_01_1815757	12	The report , by Richard S. Gray of the University of Saskatchewan , Andrew Schmitz of the University of Florida and Troy G. Schmitz at Arizona State University , concluded that farmers ' barley revenue from the wheat board was 59 million Canadian dollars higher from 1995 to 2004 than it would have been in an open market system .
2007_01_01_1815757	13	Wheat board supporters argue that the board also helps farmers by negotiating terms with railways and ports .
2007_01_01_1815757	14	The system seems to have supporters on the buyers ' side as well .
2007_01_01_1815757	15	It provides a more uniform grading of grains than is available in the United States , for instance .
2007_01_01_1815757	16	But averaging prices has a significant drawback for some farmers .
2007_01_01_1815757	17	By definition , an average price is often lower than what individual farmers who live near the United States border could obtain by directly trucking their harvest south .
2007_01_01_1815757	18	The province of Alberta , home to Prime Minister Stephen Harper , has long opposed the board for that reason , among others .
2007_01_01_1815757	19	Chuck Strahl , the minister of agriculture , has repeatedly said that all he wants is to give farmers the choice of pooling their risk through the wheat board or going out on their own . ''
2007_01_01_1815757	20	We are trying to get more marketing choice for farmers , '' he told the House of Commons in December . ''
2007_01_01_1815757	21	We want to put more money in their pockets .
2007_01_01_1815757	22	We want them to take advantage of their own expertise . ''
2007_01_01_1815757	23	Professor Fulton argued in a separate study published last month that the wheat board can not survive in an open market .
2007_01_01_1815757	24	Indeed , its history before it was granted a monopoly supports that idea .
2007_01_01_1815757	25	The operation floundered as farmers chose the open market when prices were high , returning to the board only during hard times .
2007_01_01_1815757	26	Mr. Strahl has not found it easy to end the board 's monopoly .
2007_01_01_1815757	27	A 1998 law gave farmers control of the board by letting them directly elect 10 of its 15 directors , with the balance , including the president , being appointed by the government .
2007_01_01_1815757	28	( Because the government guarantees the board 's finances , however , it retained the power to issue cabinet orders . )
2007_01_01_1815757	29	The Conservatives , in the minority , have been unable to get any of the other parties to support changes in the wheat board .
2007_01_01_1815757	30	An attempt earlier this year to amend the board 's legislation was resoundingly defeated by opposition parties .
2007_01_01_1815757	31	And when five wheat board positions came up for election this fall , the government heavily promoted candidates who backed its plan .
2007_01_01_1815757	32	Farmers , however , responded by electing four candidates who favor the current monopoly .
2007_01_01_1815757	33	Now Mr. Strahl plans a vote on creating an open barley market early in 2007 .
2007_01_01_1815757	34	But he has also made it clear that the government will not be bound by its results .
2007_01_01_1815757	35	The level of support for the government 's open market plan is unclear .
2007_01_01_1815757	36	Even Mr. Strahl said during recent committee testimony : '' I think I 've had 4,500 letters on wheat board issues since I 've been in office .
2007_01_01_1815757	37	They are almost equally divided . ''
2007_01_01_1815757	38	Mr. Measner , a 34-year veteran of the wheat board , had become something of a minor celebrity by rebuffing orders from Mr. Strahl and his staff to stop promoting the monopoly system and start backing the government 's plan .
2007_01_01_1815757	39	Before his dismissal on Dec. 22 , Mr. Measner began a court challenge of a cabinet order requiring the board to support the government , arguing that it is unconstitutional and outside the government 's power over the board . ''
2007_01_01_1815757	40	The government has a direction they 're taking the wheat board , and it does n't matter what people say or what people want , '' Mr. Measner said in an interview from his home after his firing . ''
2007_01_01_1815757	41	My position is that it should be farmers making the decision . ''
2007_01_01_1815757	42	Ken Ritter , a farmer from Saskatchewan who is the board 's chairman , said the legal challenge of the government 's orders will continue as will the board 's campaign to keep the current system . ''
2007_01_01_1815757	43	This is very , very divisive , '' Mr. Ritter said . ''
2007_01_01_1815757	44	This has gone on for 40 years . ''
2007_01_01_1815757	45	Professor Fulton said that by firing Mr. Measner and attempting to gag the board , the government runs the danger of alienating even some of the farmers who back its open market position . ''
2007_01_01_1815757	46	The view seems to be shifting , '' Professor Fulton said . ''
2007_01_01_1815757	47	Even farmers who might support a change in the wheat board are saying , why do it this way ? ''
2007_01_01_1815758	0	An anonymous computer programmer may have skewed the competition over standards for high-definition DVD discs by possibly defeating a scheme that both sides use to protect digital content .
2007_01_01_1815758	1	The standards , HD-DVD and Blu-ray , are being backed by rival coalitions of Hollywood studios and consumer electronics and computer companies that are eagerly marketing a new generation of digital media players and video game machines tailored for widescreen TVs .
2007_01_01_1815758	2	The HD-DVD coalition includes companies like Microsoft , Intel , Toshiba and NEC ; the Blu-ray camp has Sony , Philips and Samsung .
2007_01_01_1815758	3	Among studios , Universal is exclusively backing HD-DVD .
2007_01_01_1815758	4	Paramount and Warner Brothers also support HD-DVD , but not exclusively .
2007_01_01_1815758	5	Representatives of Walt Disney , 20th Century Fox and Warner Brothers are on the board of the Blu-ray group .
2007_01_01_1815758	6	The two groups have taken different technical approaches in their efforts to prohibit consumers from making copies of movies and other digital material stored on discs .
2007_01_01_1815758	7	Both groups use an encryption scheme known as Advanced Access Copy System .
2007_01_01_1815758	8	The Blu-ray system also adds a software-based component that makes it possible to modify the copy protection scheme on new discs if the old one is broken by hackers .
2007_01_01_1815758	9	The standards are brand new , but it appears that the two groups ' copy protection schemes are already about to be tested .
2007_01_01_1815758	10	The HD-DVD camp may have suffered a setback when the programmer , who identified himself as Muslix64 , announced in the Internet discussion forum Doom9 on Dec. 18 that he had successfully copied movies distributed in the HD-DVD format .
2007_01_01_1815758	11	The note directed readers to a site where demonstration software he had written could be downloaded . ''
2007_01_01_1815758	12	I was not aware of anyone having done that , so I did , '' he wrote .
2007_01_01_1815758	13	In an accompanying video demonstration posted on the YouTube Web site , the programmer showed encryption keys for six movies and concluded by stating '' A.A.C.S. is unbreakable ?
2007_01_01_1815758	14	I do n't think so .
2007_01_01_1815758	15	Stay tuned for source code in January .
2007_01_01_1815758	16	Because the encryption system has a hierarchy of encryption keys , simply breaking the system for a single movie does not mean that it is possible to copy all movies .
2007_01_01_1815758	17	Technical experts who have examined the software posted by Muslix64 said that it was only a partial solution for making copies of the digitally protected material , but that it did not bode well for the Advanced Access Content System . ''
2007_01_01_1815758	18	They 're playing with something that is incomplete , but it is still a troubling sign , '' said Richard Doherty , the president of Envisioneering , a consumer electronics industry consulting firm .
2007_01_01_1815758	19	The programmer has said that he plans to post more software on Tuesday , describing a more complete attack on A.A.C.S. On Friday , the industry group that is completing the A.A.C.S. protection standard issued a short statement saying that it was aware of the claims but had not yet verified them .
2007_01_01_1815758	20	If the person who identified himself as Muslix64 is able to create a complete version of a decryption program , or if others extend the software so that consumers without technical expertise can readily make copies of movies , that would create a crisis for the HD-DVD camp .
2007_01_01_1815758	21	That system contains a '' revocation '' mechanism for shutting down HD-DVD players whose encryption system has been compromised .
2007_01_01_1815758	22	But industry analysts say that taking such a step would give the HD-DVD system a tremendous black eye , angering consumers and shaking the confidence of Hollywood studios in the system .
2007_01_01_1815758	23	Today 's DVDs are protected using an earlier encryption technique known as Content Scramble System , or C.S.S. .
2007_01_01_1815758	24	That system was undermined in 1999 by a small group of programmers , and movie studios have said that the new A.A.C.S. would not fall victim to the same kind of technological attack .
2007_01_01_1815758	25	The Blu-ray system adds modifiable copy protection software , known as BD Plus , that is based on an approach pioneered by a group of technologists at Cryptography Research in San Francisco as a safeguard in the event the A.A.C.S. is compromised .
2007_01_01_1815758	26	Industry executives said that Microsoft opposed the Cryptography approach because it would shift control to the studio and away from hardware makers .
2007_01_01_1815758	27	If the HD-DVD protection system has indeed been compromised , it was not immediately clear which camp would benefit most directly .
2007_01_01_1815758	28	Some posters in Internet discussion groups have argued that the cracking of HD-DVD may increase the popularity of the system among consumers eager to make copies of movies they have purchased .
2007_01_01_1815758	29	At the same time , a weakened encryption system could undermine studio support , causing some to turn to the Blu-ray technology instead and giving the Blu-ray group an advantage in offering a wider range of content .
2007_01_01_1815759	0	The voluntary collaborative '' wiki '' model , which was marshaled to create the behemoth online encyclopedia Wikipedia , is being recruited for another challenge : to build a better search engine .
2007_01_01_1815759	1	The project , called Wikiasari for now , was announced in December by Wikia , a for-profit company co-founded by Jimmy Wales , the former options trader who has been the public face of Wikipedia .
2007_01_01_1815759	2	Like Wikipedia , a wiki search engine would be based on the idea that volunteers can do the work of paid specialists -- in the case of search engines , the work of sophisticated computers that evaluate Web sites for relevance using secret criteria . ''
2007_01_01_1815759	3	The one thing that I feel like I know how to do is build communities , '' Mr. Wales said . ''
2007_01_01_1815759	4	I mean it differently than the way it is often abused in the Internet community as feedback ratings .
2007_01_01_1815759	5	I mean people who know each other , who have discussions .
2007_01_01_1815759	6	In Wikipedia , there are discussions .
2007_01_01_1815759	7	We want to encourage that here . ''
2007_01_01_1815759	8	The Wikia search engine would allow users to see how the results were generated and modify those rankings using their own knowledge of the Internet .
2007_01_01_1815759	9	Any changes could be reversed by a different user , and , as in Wikipedia , long discussions could ensue over the decisions . ''
2007_01_01_1815759	10	I suspect there is a need for categorization and grouping '' by the volunteers , Mr. Wales said . ''
2007_01_01_1815759	11	It would not make sense to have a dialogue for each long-tail search .
2007_01_01_1815759	12	For popular searches , it makes sense . '' ''
2007_01_01_1815759	13	The question is : Will there be a demand ? ''
2007_01_01_1815759	14	I think there will be .
2007_01_01_1815759	15	People are not happy with the lack of transparency . ''
2007_01_01_1815759	16	Gil Penchina , the chief executive of Wikia , compared the search-engine process to filtering spam . ''
2007_01_01_1815759	17	Humans are pretty good at that ; machines are not so good at that , '' he said . ''
2007_01_01_1815759	18	What is obvious to a person is not always obvious to a machine .
2007_01_01_1815759	19	There are all sorts of tricks to fool the search engines .
2007_01_01_1815759	20	We think that people are better than machines at making decisions about what are proper results for any search term you type in . ''
2007_01_01_1815759	21	Mr. Wales and Angela Beesley , a co-founder of Wikia , are pivoting from the nonprofit encyclopedia to the world of dot-com start-ups .
2007_01_01_1815759	22	Mr. Penchina said that Wikia , which is based in Menlo Park , Calif. , had raised $ 4 million from a group of investors , and that in December it had additionally received '' an undisclosed , significant cash investment '' from Amazon.com .
2007_01_01_1815759	23	As for the idea of getting people to donate their work to a for-profit operation , Mr. Wales said , '' Part of the incentive problem is making it fun . ''
2007_01_01_1815759	24	As Wikia 's profile increases , the officials of the nonprofit Wikimedia Foundation -- which says it is dedicated to encouraging the growth , development and distribution of free , multilingual content -- say they are trying to make the distinctions between the two more clear .
2007_01_01_1815759	25	The foundation , '' was originally very related to Wikia , '' said Florence Devouard , who replaced Mr. Wales as chairman , in an e-mail message from France where she lives .
2007_01_01_1815759	26	And '' accordingly , in the past few months , we have worked on entirely separating the two entities . ''
2007_01_01_1815759	27	As for concerns that the Wikia search engine , perhaps with groupings and categories , could become more like a for-profit Wikipedia , Ms. Devouard said in the e-mail message that she was not worried . ''
2007_01_01_1815759	28	There is already a Wikipedia and people are n't going to waste their time reinventing the wheel . ''
2007_01_01_1815760	0	In brand-new offices with a still-empty game room and enough space to triple their staff of nearly 30 , a trio of entrepreneurs is leading an Internet start-up with an improbable mission : to out-Google Google .
2007_01_01_1815760	1	The three started Powerset , a company whose aim is to deliver better answers than any other search engine -- including Google -- by letting users type questions in plain English .
2007_01_01_1815760	2	And they have made believers of Silicon Valley investors whose fortunes turn on identifying the next big thing . ''
2007_01_01_1815760	3	There 's definitely a segment of the market that thinks we are crazy , '' said Charles Moldow , a partner at Foundation Capital , a venture capital firm that is Powerset 's principal financial backer . ''
2007_01_01_1815760	4	In 2000 , some people thought Google was crazy . ''
2007_01_01_1815760	5	Powerset is hardly alone .
2007_01_01_1815760	6	Even as Google continues to outmaneuver its main search rivals , Yahoo and Microsoft , plenty of newcomers -- with names like hakia , ChaCha and Snap -- are trying to beat the company at its own game .
2007_01_01_1815760	7	And Wikia Inc. , a company started by a founder of Wikipedia , plans to develop a search engine that , like the popular Web-based encyclopedia , would be built by a community of programmers and users .
2007_01_01_1815760	8	These ambitious quests reflect the renewed optimism sweeping technology centers like Silicon Valley and fueling a nascent Internet boom .
2007_01_01_1815760	9	It also shows how much the new Internet economy resembles a planetary system where everything and everyone orbits around search in general , and around Google in particular .
2007_01_01_1815760	10	Silicon Valley is filled with start-ups whose main business proposition is to be bought by Google , or for that matter by Yahoo or Microsoft .
2007_01_01_1815760	11	Countless other start-ups rely on Google as their primary driver of traffic or on Google 's powerful advertising system as their primary source of income .
2007_01_01_1815760	12	Virtually all new companies compete with Google for scarce engineering talent .
2007_01_01_1815760	13	And divining Google 's next move has become a fixation for scores of technology blogs and a favorite parlor game among technology investors . ''
2007_01_01_1815760	14	There is way too much obsession with search , as if it were the end of the world , '' said Esther Dyson , a well-known technology investor and forecaster . ''
2007_01_01_1815760	15	Google equals money equals search equals search advertising ; it all gets combined as if this is the last great business model . ''
2007_01_01_1815760	16	It may not be the last great business model , but Google has proved that search linked to advertising is a very large and lucrative business , and everyone -- including Ms. Dyson , who invested a small sum in Powerset -- seems to want a piece of it .
2007_01_01_1815760	17	Since the beginning of 2004 , venture capitalists have put nearly $ 350 million into no fewer than 79 start-ups that had something to do with Internet search , according to the National Venture Capital Association , an industry group .
2007_01_01_1815760	18	An overwhelming majority are not trying to take Google head on , but rather are focusing on specialized slices of the search world , like searching for videos , blog postings or medical information .
2007_01_01_1815760	19	Since Google 's stated mission is to organize all of the world 's information , they may still find themselves in the search giant 's cross hairs .
2007_01_01_1815760	20	That is not necessarily bad , as being acquired by Google could be a financial bonanza for some of these entrepreneurs and investors .
2007_01_01_1815760	21	But in the current boom , there is money even for those with the audacious goal of becoming a better Google .
2007_01_01_1815760	22	Powerset recently received $ 12.5 million in financing .
2007_01_01_1815760	23	Hakia , which like Powerset is trying to create a '' natural language '' search engine , got $ 16 million .
2007_01_01_1815760	24	Another $ 16 million went to Snap , which has focused on presenting search results in a more compelling way and is experimenting with a new advertising model .
2007_01_01_1815760	25	And ChaCha , which uses paid researchers that act as virtual reference librarians to provide answers to users ' queries , got $ 6.1 million .
2007_01_01_1815760	26	Still , recent history suggests that gaining traction is going to be difficult .
2007_01_01_1815760	27	Of dozens of search start-ups that were introduced in recent years , none had more than a 1 percent share of the United States search market in November , according to Nielsen NetRatings , a research firm that measures Internet traffic .
2007_01_01_1815760	28	Amassing a large audience has proved to be a challenge even for those with a track record and resources .
2007_01_01_1815760	29	Consider A9 , a search engine owned by Amazon.com that received positive reviews when it began in 2004 and was run by Udi Manber , a widely recognized search specialist .
2007_01_01_1815760	30	Despite some innovative features and early successes , A9 has captured only a tiny share of the market .
2007_01_01_1815760	31	Mr. Manber now works for Google , where he is vice president of engineering .
2007_01_01_1815760	32	The setback apparently has not stopped Amazon or its chief executive , Jeffrey P. Bezos , from pursuing profits in search .
2007_01_01_1815760	33	ChaCha said it counts an investment company owned by Mr. Bezos among its backers , and Amazon is an investor in Wikia .
2007_01_01_1815760	34	An Amazon spokeswoman said Mr. Bezos does not comment about his personal investments .
2007_01_01_1815760	35	Some start-ups are similarly bullish . ''
2007_01_01_1815760	36	We expect to be one of the top three search engines , '' said Riza C. Berkan , the chief executive of hakia .
2007_01_01_1815760	37	It is a bold claim , given that hakia 's technology is not yet ready for prime time , and Mr. Berkan readily concedes it will take time to perfect it .
2007_01_01_1815760	38	The dream , however , is quintessential Silicon Valley . ''
2007_01_01_1815760	39	It is hard for me to believe that anybody thinks they can take Google 's business from Google , '' said Randy Komisar , a venture capitalist who was once known as Silicon Valley 's '' virtual C.E.O. '' for his role as a mentor to scores of technology firms . ''
2007_01_01_1815760	40	But to call the game over because Google has been such a success would be to deny history . ''
2007_01_01_1815760	41	In some ways , the willingness of so many to make multimillion-dollar investments to take on Google and other search companies represents a startling change .
2007_01_01_1815760	42	In the late 1990s , when Microsoft dominated the technology world , inventors and investors did everything they could to avoid competing with the software company .
2007_01_01_1815760	43	Yet many of today 's search start-ups are putting themselves squarely in the path of the Google steamroller .
2007_01_01_1815760	44	Most explain that decision in similar ways .
2007_01_01_1815760	45	They say that Google 's dominance today is different from Microsoft 's in the late 90s when its operating system was a virtual monopoly and nearly impossible to break .
2007_01_01_1815760	46	In the Internet search industry , '' you earn your right to be in business every day , page view after page view , click after click , '' said Barney Pell , a founder and the chief executive of Powerset , whose search service is not yet available .
2007_01_01_1815760	47	They also say that the market for search simply is too large to resist .
2007_01_01_1815760	48	Google , which , according to Nielsen , handles about half of all Internet searches in the United States , is valued at an astonishing $ 141 billion .
2007_01_01_1815760	49	So , the reasoning goes , anyone who can grab even a small slice of the search market could be well rewarded . ''
2007_01_01_1815760	50	You do n't need to be No. 1 to be worth billions of dollars , '' said Allen Morgan , a partner at Mayfield Fund , a venture capital firm that invested $ 10 million in Snap .
2007_01_01_1815760	51	The company is also backed by Bill Gross , an Internet financier who pioneered the idea of linking ads and search results , only to see Google seize the powerful business model and improve on it .
2007_01_01_1815760	52	Almost all of today 's search entrepreneurs also say that Google 's success lends credibility to their own long-shot quest .
2007_01_01_1815760	53	When Lawrence Page and Sergey Brin first started tinkering with what would become Google , other search engines like AltaVista and Lycos and Excite were dominant .
2007_01_01_1815760	54	But the companies that owned them were distracted by efforts to diversify their businesses , and they took their eye off the ball of Internetsearch and stopped innovating .
2007_01_01_1815760	55	Some now say that search has not evolved much in years , and that Google is similarly distracted as it introduces new products like word processors , spreadsheets and online payment systems and expands into online video , social networking and other businesses . ''
2007_01_01_1815760	56	The more Google starts to think about taking on Microsoft , the less it is a pure search play , and the more it opens the door for new innovations , '' said Mr. Moldow , the Foundation Capital partner . ''
2007_01_01_1815760	57	That 's great for us . ''
2007_01_01_1815760	58	But at the same time , Google , Yahoo and Microsoft have thousands of engineers , including some of the world 's top search specialists , working on improving their search results .
2007_01_01_1815760	59	And they have spent billions building vast computer networks so they can respond instantly to the endless stream of queries from around the world .
2007_01_01_1815760	60	Search '' is becoming an increasingly capital-intensive business , '' said Marissa Mayer , Google 's vice president for search .
2007_01_01_1815760	61	That makes it harder for start-ups to catch up to the giants , she said .
2007_01_01_1815760	62	That is not stopping entrepreneurs from betting that they can .
2007_01_01_1815760	63	Powerset has search and natural-language experts among its two dozen employees , including former top engineers from Yahoo and a former chief linguist from Ask Jeeves , Ask.com 's predecessor .
2007_01_01_1815760	64	They are the kind of people who could easily land jobs at Google or Microsoft or Yahoo .
2007_01_01_1815760	65	Steve Newcomb , a Powerset founder and veteran of several successful start-ups , said his company could become the next Google .
2007_01_01_1815760	66	Or , he said , if Google or someone else perfected natural-language search before Powerset , then his company would make a great acquisition for one of the other search companies . ''
2007_01_01_1815760	67	We are a huge story no matter what , '' he said .
2007_01_01_1815760	68	Ms. Dyson , the technology commentator and Powerset investor , captured the optimism more concisely and with less swagger . ''
2007_01_01_1815760	69	I love Google , '' she said , '' but I love the march of history . ''
2007_01_01_1815761	0	As the Jewel of the Seas , a luxury cruise ship owned by Royal Caribbean , steamed down the coast toward Bermuda in late October , there were plenty of distractions , including two Olympic-size pools , Latin dance lessons and Boozer Bingo .
2007_01_01_1815761	1	But Birdie Jaworski was having none of it .
2007_01_01_1815761	2	Ms. Jaworski , a single mother who sells Avon products in tiny Las Vegas , N.M. , instead spent much of her time inside the ship 's lounges and meeting rooms with other book enthusiasts , listening to authors like Elinor Lipman ( '' My Latest Grievance '' ) , Terri Jentz ( '' Strange Piece of Paradise '' ) , and Lynnette Khalfani ( '' The Money Coach 's Guide to Your First Million '' ) . ''
2007_01_01_1815761	3	I was having so much fun hanging out with people with the same literary interests as me , '' said Ms. Jaworski , who runs a book club in her hometown and is herself an aspiring author .
2007_01_01_1815761	4	Ms. Jaworski was one of about 150 book lovers aboard the ship for a five-day literary-themed cruise out of Boston .
2007_01_01_1815761	5	Known as Book It to Bermuda , it is just the latest example of a growing genre of cruises that could be called Ship Lit .
2007_01_01_1815761	6	Often sponsored by publishers , the cruises , aboard commercial liners , feature popular authors who give readings and seminars -- even knitting lessons -- to boatfuls of book lovers .
2007_01_01_1815761	7	Ms. Jaworski was particularly impressed with a presentation by Ms. Jentz , whose book recounts a brutal attack she survived in Oregon 30 years ago , and subsequent journey back to the scene to investigate .
2007_01_01_1815761	8	The seas were rough that day , according Ms. Jaworski , so Ms. Jentz delivered her presentation sitting down . ''
2007_01_01_1815761	9	I enjoyed it , even though I was feeling a little queasy , '' said Ms. Jaworski .
2007_01_01_1815761	10	For authors and their publishers , the cruises offer an opportunity to promote their books to a captive audience of hundreds of enthusiastic readers .
2007_01_01_1815761	11	People tend to read a lot on cruises , and the profile of a typical Ship Lit cruise customer -- older and female -- is an especially good match for romance , health and fitness books , publishers say . ''
2007_01_01_1815761	12	It 's become increasingly difficult to create and build a book and make it successful , '' says Keith Fox , president of McGraw-Hill Professional , the division of the McGraw-Hill Companies that published Ms. Khalfani 's financial advice book .
2007_01_01_1815761	13	Literary cruises , he said , are '' an opportunity for us to get our authors in front of a demographic that loves books . ''
2007_01_01_1815761	14	Authors say the environment makes for a special experience . ''
2007_01_01_1815761	15	You get to connect with people in a way that you never would at a bookshop , '' Ms. Khalfani said . ''
2007_01_01_1815761	16	I had people stopping me in the bathroom , in the spa .
2007_01_01_1815761	17	I probably gave another three or four minisessions just sitting around talking shop . ''
2007_01_01_1815761	18	The feeling was mutual . ''
2007_01_01_1815761	19	Bermuda was stunning , but the authors made the cruise , '' says Julie Rogers , a self-described '' crazed reader '' from San Jose , Calif. , who was on the cruise .
2007_01_01_1815761	20	The company that has done the most to promote Ship Lit , however , is Levy Home Entertainment , a book distributor with thousands of retail accounts , including Wal-Mart Stores , Target , and Kmart .
2007_01_01_1815761	21	With the support of major publishers , Levy has organized two Authors at Sea cruises that each featured more than two dozen authors .
2007_01_01_1815761	22	Mary Higgins Clark , Paul Levine , a mystery writer , and Arthur Frommer , a travel expert , have been headliners on the cruises , while Jackie Collins and Dean Koontz have lent their star power to bon voyage parties .
2007_01_01_1815761	23	The next cruise is tentatively scheduled for 2008 .
2007_01_01_1815761	24	Levy has long sought novel ways to spur sales of mass market paperbacks , which the company says account for a third of its sales , such as organizing bus tours and driving groups of authors from city to city to do signings .
2007_01_01_1815761	25	The idea for a literary cruise grew out of that experience , says Pam Nelson , director of promotions for Levy .
2007_01_01_1815761	26	Publishers say it is difficult to measure the direct impact of the cruises , but they say participating authors see an increase in sales .
2007_01_01_1815761	27	Harlequin Enterprises sent a half dozen of its writers on the Authors at Sea cruise last spring .
2007_01_01_1815761	28	Craig Swinwood , executive vice president for sales and marketing at Harlequin , notes that those authors , including Debbie Macomber and Carla Neggers , had record years .
2007_01_01_1815761	29	Still , '' you could do five cities in that same week , '' on a regular book tour , he said .
2007_01_01_1815761	30	Books by participating authors are sold onboard .
2007_01_01_1815761	31	Levy sold about 2,500 books on its last cruise .
2007_01_01_1815761	32	And the marketing starts months beforehand .
2007_01_01_1815761	33	In Levy 's case , featured books are distributed with an Authors at Sea logo on the covers , and tucked inside each book is a coupon for $ 250 toward the price of the cruise .
2007_01_01_1815761	34	But the real payoff may come from the word-of-mouth after vacationers return home , telling their friends and posting their thoughts on one of the many book-oriented Web sites and blogs . ''
2007_01_01_1815761	35	These are not just readers ; these are power readers that can really drive trends in the book business , '' says John Lindsay , a vice president at Levy .
2007_01_01_1815761	36	Indeed , the Internet has changed the dynamics of the book business in profound ways .
2007_01_01_1815761	37	Ms. Macomber , who has written dozens of mass market novels , keeps in touch with her fans through her own Web site . ''
2007_01_01_1815761	38	We 're used to being in that celestial cloud , '' she said . ''
2007_01_01_1815761	39	Now authors are out there .
2007_01_01_1815761	40	You have to be . ''
2007_01_01_1815761	41	As a featured author on the Levy cruise , Ms. Macomber gave knitting lessons to attendees ( knitting features prominently in her 2005 novel , '' A Good Yarn '' ) .
2007_01_01_1815761	42	After the cruise , she added the readers she had met to her mailing list , and many have left messages on her online guest book , she said .
2007_01_01_1815761	43	Kate Duffy , editorial director of the Kensington Publishing Corporation ( whose author , Beverly Barton , was on the last Levy cruise ) , courts these readers , whom she affectionately calls '' the big mouths , '' sending them manuscripts and soliciting their opinions .
2007_01_01_1815761	44	After attending the Authors at Sea trip , she said , '' I added 10 more big mouths to my list . ''
2007_01_01_1815762	0	You know what they say about the best-laid plans .
2007_01_01_1815762	1	The Wall Street Journal is now an expert .
2007_01_01_1815762	2	The paper is introducing its newly designed version -- and smaller size -- tomorrow .
2007_01_01_1815762	3	It has been touting the design , which it first announced more than a year ago , in a publicity campaign for the last month , building momentum toward the Jan. 2 introduction .
2007_01_01_1815762	4	The only problem is that Wall Street is shutting down tomorrow to mark the death of former President Gerald R. Ford .
2007_01_01_1815762	5	Both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock Market are following tradition , dating from the burial of Ulysses S. Grant in 1885 , in honoring the death of a president by halting trading .
2007_01_01_1815762	6	That means The Journal 's core audience is likely to miss the ballyhooed first issue .
2007_01_01_1815762	7	A spokesman for The Journal said that the closing of the markets would not have much affect on the paper 's publicity plans , which include giving away half a million copies free at 40,000 newsstands across the country -- most of them not in Manhattan .
2007_01_01_1815762	8	And most of those copies that are in Manhattan are to be distributed at transportation hubs outside the financial district , like Grand Central Terminal , Penn Station and the Port Authority , to reach ordinary commuters , not the pinstripes downtown .
2007_01_01_1815762	9	But the crowning feature of the planned hoopla was for Peter R. Kann , chairman of Dow Jones , which owns The Journal , to ring the closing bell at the New York Stock exchange tomorrow .
2007_01_01_1815762	10	That prized showcase is now canceled .
2007_01_01_1815762	11	KATHARINE Q. SEELYE MEDIA TALK
2007_01_01_1815763	0	In Microsoft 's latest attempt to reach out to bloggers , the company recently gave away expensive laptops loaded with its new Windows Vista operating system .
2007_01_01_1815763	1	But the gifts generated controversy as well as good will , as many in that community accused Microsoft of bribery and their peers of unethical behavior .
2007_01_01_1815763	2	Several bloggers reported last week that they had received Acer Ferrari laptops , which can sell for more than $ 2,200 , from Microsoft .
2007_01_01_1815763	3	A spokeswoman for Microsoft confirmed on Friday that the company had sent out about 90 computers to bloggers who write about technology and other subjects ( such as photography and , oddly , parenting ) that could be affected by the new operating system .
2007_01_01_1815763	4	But while those on Microsoft 's mailing list initially greeted the machines with enthusiasm , many in the blogging community soon objected -- and not only because they were left off the list -- arguing that bloggers are bound by the same rules as traditional journalists , who should not accept expensive gifts from companies they cover .
2007_01_01_1815763	5	Long Zheng , an Australian blogger ( istartedsomething.com ) who received one of the computers , had over 160 comments on his post about the computers , ranging from envy to disgust . ''
2007_01_01_1815763	6	It 's a bribe .
2007_01_01_1815763	7	Plain and simple , '' wrote one commenter .
2007_01_01_1815763	8	Being provided an evaluation computer from Acer is not a ` bribe , ' '' Blake Handler , a Los Angeles blogger ( bhandler.spaces.live.com / ) who received a laptop and who plans to keep it , wrote in a comment to Mr. Zheng 's original post . ''
2007_01_01_1815763	9	It simply allows me to accelerate my evaluations , documentation and demonstrations of Windows Vista . ''
2007_01_01_1815763	10	Microsoft has recently made several efforts to engage the technologically aware , and often anti-Microsoft , blogging community .
2007_01_01_1815763	11	After the criticisms of the laptop giveaway began , a Microsoft employee sent an e-mail message to some of the recipients , asking them to return or give away the machines when they were finished evaluating Vista .
2007_01_01_1815763	12	However , Microsoft 's spokeswoman said in an e-mailed statement that the followup message had caused confusion , and that the bloggers were still welcome to keep the computers . ''
2007_01_01_1815763	13	Microsoft 's official position is that once these bloggers are done experiencing the product , they can choose what they want to do with them , '' she said .

2007_01_01_1815769	1	No thwack against a friend 's head .
2007_01_01_1815769	2	No melting on tongues .
2007_01_01_1815769	3	For the last two months , no snow has fallen on Central Park , and it probably wo n't fall anytime soon , forecasters say .
2007_01_01_1815769	4	Indeed , not since April 8 has there been even a flurry .
2007_01_01_1815769	5	The National Weather Service said that last month appeared to be the first December without a snowflake here since 1877 , when Rutherford B. Hayes was president .
2007_01_01_1815769	6	Moreover , New York City is not alone .
2007_01_01_1815769	7	Warsaw , Budapest , Berlin , Vienna and Stockholm report little or no snow this season .
2007_01_01_1815769	8	It has been so warm in Yaroslavl , a city about 150 miles northeast of Moscow , that Masha the bear , a resident of the city zoo , woke up last month from his hibernation after only a week .
2007_01_01_1815769	9	In Central Park on Saturday , where children were gliding along on roller skates and rumbling around on three-wheelers , Rob Flanagan , 35 , a general contractor from Hoboken , N.J. , was peeved . ''
2007_01_01_1815769	10	Al might be right ! ''
2007_01_01_1815769	11	Mr. Flanagan was referring to Al Gore , the former vice president and crusader against greenhouse gases .
2007_01_01_1815769	12	The mild weather stinks , he said . ''
2007_01_01_1815769	13	I like the snow ! ''
2007_01_01_1815769	14	Stuart Welburn , a lawyer who lives on the Upper West Side , disagreed on behalf of his 9-month-old son , Owen , whom he was carrying on his shoulder . ''
2007_01_01_1815769	15	This guy is happier without the biting cold , '' Mr. Welburn said , adding that Owen 's mother , Melissa , was the same way .
2007_01_01_1815769	16	On the other hand , Mr. Welburn and his older son , Will , 21/2 , love the snow and tobogganing . ''
2007_01_01_1815769	17	We play in the snow right there , on that mound in particular , '' Mr. Welburn said , motioning toward a small hill just off the West 72nd Street entrance to Central Park . ''
2007_01_01_1815769	18	This whole area is well populated with sleds in the winter . ''
2007_01_01_1815769	19	Jason Krantz , 38 , another lawyer who lives on the Upper West Side , said he did n't miss the snow .
2007_01_01_1815769	20	His two toddlers and a nephew were busy clambering up a big boulder , yelling '' 123 ! ''
2007_01_01_1815769	21	and then jumping down into Mr. Krantz 's outstretched arms . ''
2007_01_01_1815769	22	I enjoy the snow when it 's here , '' Mr. Krantz said as he watched for flying children . ''
2007_01_01_1815769	23	But I 'm just as happy when there 's no snow here as well , because you do n't have to cover the kids in scarves and gloves and mittens . ''
2007_01_01_1815769	24	Todd Miner , a meteorologist at Pennsylvania State University , said mild temperatures were likely to persist in the New York metropolitan region for the next week or so .
2007_01_01_1815769	25	If there is no snow by Friday , he said , it will break a record established on Jan. 4 , 1878 , for the latest winter appearance of snow .
2007_01_01_1815769	26	Mr. Miner said it was not quite clear why snow had failed to appear . ''
2007_01_01_1815769	27	The northern branch of the jet stream -- the delivery system of arctic air -- has hunkered down near the Arctic Circle , '' he said .
2007_01_01_1815769	28	It may be because of a complex interaction between ocean temperatures and snow cover in Canada , Mr. Miner said .
2007_01_01_1815769	29	He cautioned that it would be easy to read too much into the lack of snow so far .
2007_01_01_1815769	30	The previous four winters , Mr. Miner said , each produced more than 40 inches of snow in New York City , nearly double the annual average of 22.4 inches .
2007_01_01_1815769	31	Still , Julianne Warren , 40 , a conservation biologist visiting New York from Lexington , Va. , is concerned .
2007_01_01_1815769	32	She said she heard a white-throated sparrow in Central Park and saw an azalea blooming . ''
2007_01_01_1815769	33	Things seem a little -- '' she said , and then wiggled her outstretched right hand as if it were an airplane in turbulence . ''
2007_01_01_1815769	34	It may mean the flowers do n't bloom at the right time and birds may not know to migrate at the right time . ''
2007_01_01_1815771	0	Johnny Gibson , a former world-record holder in the 400-meter hurdles and a highly successful track coach at Seton Hall University for 26 years , died Friday in a nursing home in Newton , N.J. .
2007_01_01_1815771	1	His death was announced by his son Thomas .
2007_01_01_1815771	2	Gibson 's best year as an athlete was 1927 .
2007_01_01_1815771	3	In April , he won the college 400-meter hurdles in the Penn Relays in 55.2 seconds , beating Lord David Burghley of Britain .
2007_01_01_1815771	4	After the race , some officials and coaches tried to have Gibson disqualified , contending that he was ineligible because he was a night student at Fordham University .
2007_01_01_1815771	5	Burghley said Gibson won fairly and told the officials he would not accept the first-place medal no matter what they ruled .
2007_01_01_1815771	6	They dropped the matter .
2007_01_01_1815771	7	That summer , Gibson received a degree in business administration from Fordham .
2007_01_01_1815771	8	On July 2 , the day Burghley set a world record in London of 54.2 seconds for the 440-yard hurdles , Gibson set a world record of 52.6 seconds in winning the 400-meter hurdles in the national championships in Lincoln , Neb. .
2007_01_01_1815771	9	In an interview with The New York Times in May 2002 in the home Gibson shared with his son John Jr. in rural Franklin , N.J. , Gibson recalled his record race . ''
2007_01_01_1815771	10	I was in the outside lane , '' he said . ''
2007_01_01_1815771	11	On the backstretch , I looked back and could n't see anyone .
2007_01_01_1815771	12	I thought , ` Oh boy , I got this one today . '
2007_01_01_1815771	13	But I was surprised I broke the record .
2007_01_01_1815771	14	My coach never told me I was that fast .
2007_01_01_1815771	15	He just told me to run . ''
2007_01_01_1815771	16	The coach was the celebrated Harry Coates , who tolerated no nonsense .
2007_01_01_1815771	17	As Gibson told it : '' Once , after a meet , he bought me a beer .
2007_01_01_1815771	18	When I finished it , he said , ` Do n't ever let me see you drink one of these again . ' ''
2007_01_01_1815771	19	Gibson was 5 when his father died , and he attended Bloomfield ( N.J. ) High School and then Fordham at night , working days running messages on Wall Street ( he actually ran from building to building ) .
2007_01_01_1815771	20	He trained by himself at odd hours , using park benches as hurdles .
2007_01_01_1815771	21	John Anthony Gibson was born July 3 , 1905 , in Greenwich Village and moved to New Jersey when he was 6 months old .
2007_01_01_1815771	22	He ran his first race at 13 and his last at 32 .
2007_01_01_1815771	23	The demands of work forced him to quit elite racing after the 1928 Olympics in Amsterdam , where he barely missed qualifying for the final of the 400-meter hurdles .
2007_01_01_1815771	24	After coaching Fordham 's freshman track team in the mid-1930s , he served as Seton Hall 's coach from 1946 until he retired in 1972 .
2007_01_01_1815771	25	His best athletes included Andy Stanfield , a sprinter who won two Olympic gold medals in 1952 and a silver in 1956 ; Frank Fox ; Phil Thigpen ; Harry Bright ; Bob Carter , who became Gibson 's son-in-law ; and the twins George and Herb Gehrmann .
2007_01_01_1815771	26	When recalling his race against Lord Burghley , who would win a gold medal in the 400 hurdles in the 1928 Olympics , Gibson said he never expected to lose , and Carter smiled . ''
2007_01_01_1815771	27	He taught us that , '' Carter said . ''
2007_01_01_1815771	28	It never occurred to us that we would lose . ''
2007_01_01_1815771	29	From 1925 to the late 1980s , Gibson attended all but one Penn Relays as a competitor , coach or official .
2007_01_01_1815771	30	He missed the 1973 event because of a son 's wedding .
2007_01_01_1815771	31	Gibson served there and at other meets as an unpaid clerk . ''
2007_01_01_1815771	32	My job was to get the meet on time and keep it there , '' he said . ''
2007_01_01_1815771	33	I was never late .
2007_01_01_1815771	34	I 'd get them lined up two or three races in advance . ''
2007_01_01_1815771	35	At various times , he trained Army Special Forces coaches in Germany , sold life and auto insurance and Japanese silk , kept track of material for the World War II Manhattan Project , and taught football place-kicking .
2007_01_01_1815771	36	His wife of 67 years , the former Dorothy Croughan of Bloomfield , died in 1997 .
2007_01_01_1815771	37	He is survived by two sons , John Jr. of Franklin , N.J. , and Thomas of West Orange , N.J. ; three daughters , D. Patricia Carter of Bloomfield , N.J. ; Katharine Lipinski of Surf City , N.J. , and Mary Donegan of Ogdensburg , N.J. ; a sister , Helen Ryan of Wayne , N.J. ; 19 grandchildren and 46 greatgrandchildren and 5 great-greatgrandchildren , the youngest a girl born last Wednesday .
2007_01_01_1815771	38	In 1973 , when The Times asked Gibson how track athletes had changed , he said : '' The big difference is in the attitude toward training .
2007_01_01_1815771	39	They do n't seem to take things quite as seriously as in the past and they do n't want to spend the time . ''
2007_01_01_1815771	40	In 2002 , responding to the same question , he said : '' It 's still the same , but the good ones are in it because they respect the game .
2007_01_01_1815771	41	If you 're a track man , you 're a good man . ''
2007_01_01_1815772	0	Dennis Linde , an influential and publicity-shy country songwriter who composed Elvis Presley 's soulful 1972 hit '' Burning Love '' and the Dixie Chicks ' mordantly humorous 1999 anthem '' Goodbye Earl , '' died on Dec. 22 in Nashville .
2007_01_01_1815772	1	The cause was idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis , a lung disease , family members told The Tennessean newspaper . ''
2007_01_01_1815772	2	Burning Love '' reached No. 2 on the Billboard pop listings and was Presley 's second-highest-charting single in a decade .
2007_01_01_1815772	3	Mr. Linde said he wrote the song about his recent marriage to Pam Beckham . ''
2007_01_01_1815772	4	I was a newlywed , and ` Burning Love ' was a great newlywed title , '' Mr. Linde said in an interview with The New York Times in 2005 . ''
2007_01_01_1815772	5	I had it done in 20 minutes . ''
2007_01_01_1815772	6	His wife survives him , along with their son , Will Linde , and two daughters , Lisa Marsden and Katie Brown .
2007_01_01_1815772	7	Mr. Linde cited influences as diverse as Mark Twain and George Gershwin and had a songwriting methodology as quirky as he was .
2007_01_01_1815772	8	On a wall of his home , he hung a map of his own fictitious town , where the offbeat characters in his songs lived and worked , drank and died .
2007_01_01_1815772	9	Like Hank Williams but unlike nearly all modern country writers , Mr. Linde composed both the words and music for his songs , without co-writers .
2007_01_01_1815772	10	Dennis Linde was born in 1943 at Abilene , Tex. .
2007_01_01_1815772	11	He worked in blues and rock bands in St. Louis and finally moved to Nashville in 1969 .
2007_01_01_1815772	12	The music publisher Bob Beckham , whose firm already represented a young Kris Kristofferson , signed Mr. Linde .
2007_01_01_1815772	13	Mr. Beckham also eventually became Mr. Linde 's father-in-law .
2007_01_01_1815772	14	Mr. Linde habitually avoided awards shows , even when he knew he had won .
2007_01_01_1815772	15	EMI , his current publisher , described him in a statement as '' a publicist 's nightmare and a singer 's dream . ''
2007_01_01_1815774	0	New Year 's Day is the simplest holiday in the calendar , a Champagne cork of a day after all the effervescence of the evening before .
2007_01_01_1815774	1	There is no civic agenda , no liturgical content , only the sense of something ended , something begun .
2007_01_01_1815774	2	It is a good day to clean the ashes out of the wood stove , to consider the possibilities of next summer 's garden , to wonder how many weeks into the new year you will be before you marvel at how quickly 2007 is going . ''
2007_01_01_1815774	3	This will be the year , '' you find yourself thinking , but before you can finish the thought you remember what all the previous years have taught you -- that there 's just no telling .
2007_01_01_1815774	4	We are supposed to believe in the fresh start of a new year , and who does n't love the thought of it ?
2007_01_01_1815774	5	But we are just as likely to feel the pull of the old ways on this holiday , to acknowledge the solid comfort -- like it or not -- of the self we happen to have become over the years .
2007_01_01_1815774	6	We may not say , like Charles Lamb in 1820 , that we would no more alter the shape of our lives '' than the incidents of some well-contrived novel . ''
2007_01_01_1815774	7	But we know what he means .
2007_01_01_1815774	8	No one has faced the prospect of New Year 's time more honestly than Lamb .
2007_01_01_1815774	9	He knew that its real theme was what he called '' an intolerable disinclination to dying , '' something he felt especially sharply in the dead of winter , awaiting the peal of bells ringing in the new year .
2007_01_01_1815774	10	It was an inescapable syllogism for him -- New Year , the passing of time , the certainty of death .
2007_01_01_1815774	11	What it forced from him was the very thing it should force from all of us -- a renewal of our pleasure in life itself . ''
2007_01_01_1815774	12	I am in love , '' he wrote , '' with this green earth ; the face of town and country ; the unspeakable rural solitudes , and the sweet security of streets . ''
2007_01_01_1815775	0	The long history of Congressional bipartisan cooperation on environmental issues dating back to Richard Nixon has been seriously challenged only twice .
2007_01_01_1815775	1	The first time was in 1995 , when the Gingrich Republicans swept into Washington determined to roll back environmental laws , a threat averted by President Bill Clinton 's veto pen and the exertions of a group of moderate Republicans .
2007_01_01_1815775	2	The second challenge occurred during the Congress that has now thankfully drawn to a close .
2007_01_01_1815775	3	The Democrats ' return to power in both houses has raised hopes that some of the old cooperative spirit can be restored and progress made on vital matters like global warming , oil dependency , national parks and threatened wetlands .
2007_01_01_1815775	4	Environmentalists in the House will certainly have more time to work on positive legislation , since they will no longer have to play defense against Richard Pombo , the California Republican who produced a stream of destructive schemes to open up protected public lands for commercial exploitation , rescind a longstanding moratorium on offshore drilling and undermine the Endangered Species Act .
2007_01_01_1815775	5	Mr. Pombo has been ushered into well-deserved retirement by California voters .
2007_01_01_1815775	6	On the Senate side , there have been striking changes in leadership .
2007_01_01_1815775	7	Barbara Boxer , who cares about global warming , replaces James Inhofe , who does n't , as head of the Environment and Public Works Committee .
2007_01_01_1815775	8	Jeff Bingaman , who emphasizes conservation as the appropriate response to oil dependency , replaces Pete Domenici , who tends to favor greater production of America 's dwindling supplies of oil and natural gas , as chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee .
2007_01_01_1815775	9	Although he 'll need Mr. Domenici 's help , Mr. Bingaman will almost certainly make a major push for new energy legislation , based on proposals that already have broad bipartisan support and would offer a menu of loans , direct subsidies and tax breaks to encourage the production of fuel-efficient cars as well as alternatives to gasoline .
2007_01_01_1815775	10	The main legislative responsibility for shaping a national policy on warming falls to Ms. Boxer , who has promised early consideration of various measures aimed at imposing mandatory limits on carbon dioxide emissions .
2007_01_01_1815775	11	Absent any support whatsoever from the White House and the Republican leadership , these measures have languished for years even as the problem has grown steadily worse .
2007_01_01_1815775	12	Our own wish list would include several other measures , all within reach .
2007_01_01_1815775	13	One would be to amend the Clean Air Act to require meaningful reductions in mercury from power plants , overriding the administration 's weak regulations .
2007_01_01_1815775	14	Another would provide robust financing for the national parks .
2007_01_01_1815775	15	Finally , the new Congress needs to amend the Clean Water Act to clear up the confusion caused by several court decisions involving federal protection of wetlands .
2007_01_01_1815775	16	It should assert , in unmistakable terms , that the act protects all the waters of the United States , large and small , permanent or seasonal , navigable or isolated .
2007_01_01_1815776	0	Thousands of handicapped immigrants who received asylum to enter the United States are beginning the new year caught up in the immense backlog of background checks that now chokes government administration in the wake of 9/11 .
2007_01_01_1815776	1	The glut of all cases from years past is 2.7 million and growing , according to the F.B.I. , as investigators receive a weekly torrent of 67,000 new requests -- half of them from the immigration services dealing with the normal flood of mostly healthy newcomers .
2007_01_01_1815776	2	Congress understood the special plight of handicapped immigrants who are granted asylum and made sure they are entitled to monthly disability benefits of $ 603 each as they go through the citizenship process .
2007_01_01_1815776	3	But it turns out that more than 6,000 people , including some who are amputees or blind , have already found their benefits cut off , and tens of thousands more face a similar fate , because they exceeded the seven-year deadline Congress originally considered adequate for obtaining citizenship .
2007_01_01_1815776	4	Lawyers for the handicapped are suing the government , pointing out that these cases increasingly are victims of the background backlog .
2007_01_01_1815776	5	Unless a solution is ordered , officials estimate another 46,000 will have their benefits cut off by 2012 as they become delayed in the pipeline .
2007_01_01_1815776	6	Here is a classic problem of overstrained bureaucracy in which culpability is diffuse and the results are all too poignant .
2007_01_01_1815776	7	Social Security officials say that there is no way around the law 's seven-year deadline , while background investigators are overwhelmed by security checks with no relief in sight .
2007_01_01_1815776	8	One solution is to flag the handicapped immigrants as special cases who do n't deserve a loss of benefits in the crush of antiterrorist concerns .
2007_01_01_1815776	9	The immigration law has a host of problems to be tackled by the new Congress , and handicapped newcomers should be among the first to get some attention .
2007_01_01_1815777	0	The heavy winds that blew through the Northeast a couple of weeks ago mostly missed our place .
2007_01_01_1815777	1	They took only the dead boughs , which now lie scattered along the edges of the pastures like porous old bones .
2007_01_01_1815777	2	The farmers up here will have a lot of cleaning to do along the fencelines before they bale hay next June or they will be baling kindling .
2007_01_01_1815777	3	In the woods across from our house , the wind snapped off the top of a sugar maple .
2007_01_01_1815777	4	The crown lies jagged , uneven , on the ground , not yet weighed down by gravity or moss .
2007_01_01_1815777	5	It exaggerates the disorder of nature , which seems so apparent in the absence of snow this time of year .
2007_01_01_1815777	6	Nearly every image of nature I have ever come across misses the sense of intricate confusion underfoot in the woods , the thickets of goldenrod collapsing into each other along the roadsides , the rotting tusks of fallen beeches broken against the western hillside .
2007_01_01_1815777	7	It almost never makes sense to talk about the purpose of nature .
2007_01_01_1815777	8	But now -- until the snow comes at last -- I could easily believe that the purpose of nature is to create edges , if only because every edge , no matter how small , is a new habitation .
2007_01_01_1815777	9	As purposes go , that could hardly be more different from my own , which is to reduce the number of edges here , so that the big pasture is bounded by four clean lines only , free of interruptions from sumac or knotweed or shattered maple limbs .
2007_01_01_1815777	10	Left to itself , nature is all interruption .
2007_01_01_1815777	11	These are the thoughts that crowd around during the shortest days of the year , when the sky is the color of flint and the sun , when it appears , seems to have lost its candlepower .
2007_01_01_1815777	12	Even the feeling of dormancy -- a harvest of rest -- is incomplete without snow .
2007_01_01_1815777	13	But disorder is as much in the mind as order .
2007_01_01_1815777	14	I drive across the county , brooding on confusion , and come upon a towering single oak , stripped of leaves but still symmetrical , mocking the sawmill that lies across the road .
2007_01_01_1815777	15	The sight of that one tree is enough to banish sorrow .
2007_01_01_1815777	16	Last night , sorting through photos I took in Kansas a couple of months ago , I found some digital snapshots of an ornate box turtle ( Terrapene ornata ) making its way across a gravel road .
2007_01_01_1815777	17	I had stopped the car and moved the turtle , in the direction it was pointed , to the other side of the road .
2007_01_01_1815777	18	Having written a book in the voice of a tortoise , I was of course all courtesy and did not peer closely .
2007_01_01_1815777	19	But last night I did look closely at the photos I took .
2007_01_01_1815777	20	And there is the turtle , gazing at me with a vivid orange eye , its pebbled forelimbs dotted with orange , its domed shell inscribed in an unknown cuneiform , as if to remind me that order is where you find it .

2007_01_01_1815779	0	To the Editor : Regarding your editorial suggesting that I am '' demanding that the entire nation follow one particular theology '' ( '' Fear and Bigotry in Congress , '' Dec. 23 ) , I have never even hinted at such a thing .
2007_01_01_1815779	1	As a practicing Jew , I do not share Christian theology .
2007_01_01_1815779	2	I am interested in America 's moral and civic values , not its theology .
2007_01_01_1815779	3	And those values , including the religious liberty that made it possible for non-Christians like Keith Ellison , the newly elected representative from Minnesota , and me to freely practice our religions in America , have come overwhelmingly from the Bible as understood by America 's Christians .
2007_01_01_1815779	4	So I have suggested that Mr. Ellison bring a Bible along with his Koran to his ceremonial swearing-in -- not to swear on it but to honor it , as has been done since George Washington 's inauguration .
2007_01_01_1815779	5	This gesture could make an important contribution to both American unity and the image of Islam in America .
2007_01_01_1815779	6	Dennis Prager Los Angeles , Dec. 27 , 2006 The writer is a nationally syndicated radio talk show host .
2007_01_01_1815780	0	To the Editor : '' Our Overrated Inner Self , '' by Orlando Patterson ( column , Dec. 26 ) , represents the clearest thinking on social and political discourse I 've read in a long while .
2007_01_01_1815780	1	It breaks down the reality of interpersonal relations both at a microcosmic and a macrocosmic level to its root : how we act toward one another rather than how we think about one another .
2007_01_01_1815780	2	The social contract by which we Americans live with one another here and how we live with those abroad depends more on how we abide by our agreements than on whether we agree on all our respective values and objectives .
2007_01_01_1815780	3	If it did n't sound overly religious , I 'd say Mr. Patterson 's column could be summed up by the phrase '' Do unto others as you would have others do unto you , '' long held by major religious and secular ethicists as the basis of good living .
2007_01_01_1815780	4	Irv Rubenstein Nashville , Dec. 26 , 2006 To the Editor : I agree that what sincerity '' means for us today is that the best way of living in our diverse and contentiously free society is neither to obsess about the hidden depths of our prejudices nor to deny them , but to behave as if we had none . ''
2007_01_01_1815780	5	But is it not possible that by being civil and sincere , we one day also become '' authentic '' ?
2007_01_01_1815780	6	Doing changes to being .
2007_01_01_1815780	7	Ginger Nathanson Long Valley , N.J. Dec. 26 , 2006 To the Editor : This last year has given us apologies from Mel Gibson , Michael Richards , George Allen and Terrell Owens , as well as numerous other celebrities and politicians .
2007_01_01_1815780	8	The common thread is the disassociation between the '' real '' person that each individual is '' inside '' ( or claims to be ) and the bad behavior that each has displayed in words and actions .
2007_01_01_1815780	9	Some of these individuals have gone so far as to say he did not know who it was that was speaking or acting in such a despicable manner .
2007_01_01_1815780	10	I am not sure how one can have such inner goodness and purity of heart and behave so badly .
2007_01_01_1815780	11	All I know is that I am judged by my actions and can know others only by how they behave .
2007_01_01_1815780	12	That is the foundation of a civil society .
2007_01_01_1815780	13	Bob Hoot Middleton , Wis. , Dec. 26 , 2006 To the Editor : Turn on the television or the radio and listen to the emotional discourse that passes for rational thinking .
2007_01_01_1815780	14	One hears the irrational voice that used to be kept private .
2007_01_01_1815780	15	Is this a failure of our education to impart the knowledge and confidence one needs to be mature ?
2007_01_01_1815780	16	Or is it a product of our drifting in an ocean of overcommunication ?
2007_01_01_1815780	17	Whatever it is , our need now is to take back our private self and return rational thinking to the public self .
2007_01_01_1815780	18	Hendrik E. Sadi Yonkers , Dec. 26 , 2006 To the Editor : Years ago , I read an article in The New York Times about a man who had a mean and miserly nature .
2007_01_01_1815780	19	He knew this and tried to counteract his nature by acting warmly and generously toward others .
2007_01_01_1815780	20	On his deathbed , people lauded him as a philanthropist and friend to humanity .
2007_01_01_1815780	21	Within himself , he still felt mean and miserly , but his deeds proclaimed otherwise .
2007_01_01_1815780	22	The point of that article , as of Orlando Patterson 's column , is that the effect you have on others is the important part of your essence .
2007_01_01_1815780	23	You are defined by your actions , not by your sometimes more ignoble inner thoughts .
2007_01_01_1815780	24	Barbara Preschel New York , Dec. 26 , 2006
2007_01_01_1815782	0	I 've heard the concern expressed dozens of times by New Orleans residents who are poor and black and still living in enforced exile from their wounded city : Maybe they do n't want us back .
2007_01_01_1815782	1	You hear it again and again and again , the tone of voice varying from sadness to anger to resignation , but always laced with the unmistakable pain of feeling unwelcome in one 's own home .
2007_01_01_1815782	2	I 've come to think of it as the New Orleans lament . ''
2007_01_01_1815782	3	They are not trying to bring us home , '' said Geraldine Craig , who is living in a federally sponsored trailer encampment in Baton Rouge . ''
2007_01_01_1815782	4	They 're telling us to find housing here . '' ''
2007_01_01_1815782	5	It hurts , '' said Mimi Adams , a woman who wore out her welcome with relatives in Houston and Atlanta but has no idea when she might return to New Orleans . ''
2007_01_01_1815782	6	Even if I could find a place , the rents are too high , '' she said . ''
2007_01_01_1815782	7	They 've gone up a lot .
2007_01_01_1815782	8	I 'm told they do n't want us poor folks back , that they 're making it a city for the well-to-do .
2007_01_01_1815782	9	That 's what I 'm hearing . ''
2007_01_01_1815782	10	Sixteen months have passed since the apocalyptic flood that followed Hurricane Katrina .
2007_01_01_1815782	11	More than 13,000 residents who were displaced by the storm are still living in trailers provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency .
2007_01_01_1815782	12	Another 100,000 to 200,000 evacuees -- most of whom want to return home -- are scattered throughout the United States .
2007_01_01_1815782	13	The undeniable neglect of this population fuels the suspicion among the poor and the black , who constitute a majority of the evacuees , that the city is being handed over to the well-to-do and the white .
2007_01_01_1815782	14	If you talk to public officials , you will hear about billions of dollars in aid being funneled through this program or that .
2007_01_01_1815782	15	The maze of bureaucratic initiatives is dizzying .
2007_01_01_1815782	16	But when you talk to the people most in need of help -- the poor , the elderly , the disabled , the children -- you will find in most cases that the help is not reaching them .
2007_01_01_1815782	17	There is no massive effort , no master plan , to bring back the people who were driven from the city and left destitute by Katrina .
2007_01_01_1815782	18	Only the federal government could finance such an effort .
2007_01_01_1815782	19	Neither the city of New Orleans nor the state of Louisiana has anywhere near the kind of money that would be required . ''
2007_01_01_1815782	20	You 've got a lot of people who do n't have a place to stay , '' Gov. Kathleen Blanco told me in an interview on Friday , '' and they 're spread all over creation . ''
2007_01_01_1815782	21	The federal government has not come close to meeting the challenge of this overwhelming humanitarian crisis .
2007_01_01_1815782	22	Instead of a concerted , creative effort to develop housing and organize the return to New Orleans of the poor and working-class families who were the heart and soul of the city , the government focused to a large extent on rolling out travel trailers to temporarily house an embarrassingly small percentage of the people in need . ''
2007_01_01_1815782	23	FEMA spent a lot on trailers , '' said Governor Blanco , '' trailers that are falling apart right now .
2007_01_01_1815782	24	And they spent as much money on those trailers in many cases as you would on putting a new house in place . ''
2007_01_01_1815782	25	The simple fact is that no one at any level of government , city , state or federal , has shown the leadership that was needed in response to this astounding tragedy .
2007_01_01_1815782	26	I tried to talk about this last week with the mayor of New Orleans , C. Ray Nagin , but he and his chief press aide were on vacation .
2007_01_01_1815782	27	The most candid official I spoke with was Raymond Jetson , the chief executive of the Louisiana Family Recovery Corps , an independent , nonprofit group set up by the state in the wake of the storm . ''
2007_01_01_1815782	28	The most daunting aspect of the recovery is the human recovery , '' he said , '' and at this point it has certainly not received the resources or the attention that it needs . ''
2007_01_01_1815782	29	What was readily apparent in the aftermath of the botched rescue was the damage to the levees , the ruined homes and the city 's devastated infrastructure . ''
2007_01_01_1815782	30	I do n't think , '' said Mr. Jetson , '' that the reality of what was happening in the lives of people and families was as apparent . ''
2007_01_01_1815782	31	The situation remains desperate for thousands of displaced residents . ''
2007_01_01_1815782	32	Working families are finding it difficult to re-establish their households , '' Mr. Jetson said . ''
2007_01_01_1815782	33	People who are out of state want to come back home .
2007_01_01_1815782	34	The clock is ticking on the people who are living in the FEMA trailer communities .
2007_01_01_1815782	35	You have some people who are totally isolated from resources .
2007_01_01_1815782	36	And the emotional well-being of a significant number of people and families is literally in peril . ''
2007_01_01_1815782	37	This is how the new year is starting out for the victims of the great flood of 2005 .
2007_01_01_1815783	0	The U.S. health care system is a scandal and a disgrace .
2007_01_01_1815783	1	But maybe , just maybe , 2007 will be the year we start the move toward universal coverage .
2007_01_01_1815783	2	In 2005 , almost 47 million Americans -- including more than 8 million children -- were uninsured , and many more had inadequate insurance .
2007_01_01_1815783	3	Apologists for our system try to minimize the significance of these numbers .
2007_01_01_1815783	4	Many of the uninsured , asserted the 2004 Economic Report of the President , '' remain uninsured as a matter of choice . ''
2007_01_01_1815783	5	And then you wake up .
2007_01_01_1815783	6	A scathing article in yesterday 's Los Angeles Times described how insurers refuse to cover anyone with even the slightest hint of a pre-existing condition .
2007_01_01_1815783	7	People have been denied insurance for reasons that range from childhood asthma to a '' past bout of jock itch . ''
2007_01_01_1815783	8	Some say that we ca n't afford universal health care , even though every year lack of insurance plunges millions of Americans into severe financial distress and sends thousands to an early grave .
2007_01_01_1815783	9	But every other advanced country somehow manages to provide all its citizens with essential care .
2007_01_01_1815783	10	The only reason universal coverage seems hard to achieve here is the spectacular inefficiency of the U.S. health care system .
2007_01_01_1815783	11	Americans spend more on health care per person than anyone else -- almost twice as much as the French , whose medical care is among the best in the world .
2007_01_01_1815783	12	Yet we have the highest infant mortality and close to the lowest life expectancy of any wealthy nation .
2007_01_01_1815783	13	How do we do it ?
2007_01_01_1815783	14	Part of the answer is that our fragmented system has much higher administrative costs than the straightforward government insurance systems prevalent in the rest of the advanced world .
2007_01_01_1815783	15	As Anna Bernasek pointed out in yesterday 's New York Times , besides the overhead of private insurance companies , '' there 's an enormous amount of paperwork required of American doctors and hospitals that simply does n't exist in countries like Canada or Britain . ''
2007_01_01_1815783	16	In addition , insurers often refuse to pay for preventive care , even though such care saves a lot of money in the long run , because those long-run savings wo n't necessarily redound to their benefit .
2007_01_01_1815783	17	And the fragmentation of the American system explains why we lag far behind other nations in the use of electronic medical records , which both reduce costs and save lives by preventing many medical errors .
2007_01_01_1815783	18	The truth is that we can afford to cover the uninsured .
2007_01_01_1815783	19	What we ca n't afford is to keep going without a universal health care system .
2007_01_01_1815783	20	If it were up to me , we 'd have a Medicare-like system for everyone , paid for by a dedicated tax that for most people would be less than they or their employers currently pay in insurance premiums .
2007_01_01_1815783	21	This would , at a stroke , cover the uninsured , greatly reduce administrative costs and make it much easier to work on preventive care .
2007_01_01_1815783	22	Such a system would leave people with the right to choose their own doctors , and with other choices as well : Medicare currently lets people apply their benefits to H.M.O. 's run by private insurance companies , and there 's no reason why similar options should n't be available in a system of Medicare for all .
2007_01_01_1815783	23	But everyone would be in the system , one way or another .
2007_01_01_1815783	24	Can we get there from here ?
2007_01_01_1815783	25	Health care reform is in the air .
2007_01_01_1815783	26	Democrats in Congress are talking about providing health insurance to all children .
2007_01_01_1815783	27	John Edwards began his presidential campaign with a call for universal health care .
2007_01_01_1815783	28	And there 's real action at the state level .
2007_01_01_1815783	29	Inspired by the Massachusetts plan to cover all its uninsured residents , politicians in other states are talking about adopting similar plans .
2007_01_01_1815783	30	Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon has introduced a Massachusetts-type plan for the nation as a whole .
2007_01_01_1815783	31	But now is the time to warn against plans that try to cover the uninsured without taking on the fundamental sources of our health system 's inefficiency .
2007_01_01_1815783	32	What 's wrong with both the Massachusetts plan and Senator Wyden 's plan is that they do n't operate like Medicare ; instead , they funnel the money through private insurance companies .
2007_01_01_1815783	33	Everyone knows why : would-be reformers are trying to avoid too strong a backlash from the insurance industry and other players who profit from our current system 's irrationality .
2007_01_01_1815783	34	But look at what happened to Bill Clinton .
2007_01_01_1815783	35	He rejected a single-payer approach , even though he understood its merits , in favor of a complex plan that was supposed to co-opt private insurance companies by giving them a largely gratuitous role .
2007_01_01_1815783	36	And the reward for this '' pragmatism '' was that insurance companies went all-out against his plan anyway , with the notorious '' Harry and Louise '' ads that , yes , mocked the plan 's complexity .
2007_01_01_1815783	37	Now we have another chance for fundamental health care reform .
2007_01_01_1815783	38	Let 's not blow that chance with a pre-emptive surrender to the special interests .
2007_01_01_1815784	0	MANY signs point to a growing historical consciousness among the American people .
2007_01_01_1815784	1	I trust that this is so .
2007_01_01_1815784	2	It is useful to remember that history is to the nation as memory is to the individual .
2007_01_01_1815784	3	As persons deprived of memory become disoriented and lost , not knowing where they have been and where they are going , so a nation denied a conception of the past will be disabled in dealing with its present and its future . ''
2007_01_01_1815784	4	The longer you look back , '' said Winston Churchill , '' the farther you can look forward . ''
2007_01_01_1815784	5	But all historians are prisoners of their own experience .
2007_01_01_1815784	6	We bring to history the preconceptions of our personalities and of our age .
2007_01_01_1815784	7	We can not seize on ultimate and absolute truths .
2007_01_01_1815784	8	So the historian is committed to a doomed enterprise -- the quest for an unattainable objectivity .
2007_01_01_1815784	9	Conceptions of the past are far from stable .
2007_01_01_1815784	10	They are perennially revised by the urgencies of the present .
2007_01_01_1815784	11	When new urgencies arise in our own times and lives , the historian 's spotlight shifts , probing at last into the darkness , throwing into sharp relief things that were always there but that earlier historians had carelessly excised from the collective memory .
2007_01_01_1815784	12	New voices ring out of the historical dark and demand to be heard .
2007_01_01_1815784	13	One has only to note how in the last half-century the movements for women 's rights and civil rights have reformulated and renewed American history .
2007_01_01_1815784	14	Thus the present incessantly reinvents the past .
2007_01_01_1815784	15	In this sense , all history , as Benedetto Croce said , is contemporary history .
2007_01_01_1815784	16	It is these permutations of consciousness that make history so endlessly fascinating an intellectual adventure . ''
2007_01_01_1815784	17	The one duty we owe to history , '' said Oscar Wilde , '' is to rewrite it . ''
2007_01_01_1815784	18	We are the world 's dominant military power , and I believe a consciousness of history is a moral necessity for a nation possessed of overweening power .
2007_01_01_1815784	19	History verifies John F. Kennedy 's proposition , stated in the first year of his thousand days : '' We must face the fact that the United States is neither omnipotent or omniscient -- that we are only 6 percent of the world 's population ; that we can not impose our will upon the other 94 percent of mankind ; that we can not right every wrong or reverse each adversity ; and therefore there can not be an American solution to every world problem . ''
2007_01_01_1815784	20	History is the best antidote to delusions of omnipotence and omniscience .
2007_01_01_1815784	21	Self-knowledge is the indispensable prelude to self-control , for the nation as well as for the individual , and history should forever remind us of the limits of our passing perspectives .
2007_01_01_1815784	22	It should strengthen us to resist the pressure to convert momentary impulses into moral absolutes .
2007_01_01_1815784	23	It should lead us to acknowledge our profound and chastening frailty as human beings -- to a recognition of the fact , so often and so sadly displayed , that the future outwits all our certitudes and that the possibilities of the future are more various than the human intellect is designed to conceive .
2007_01_01_1815784	24	Sometimes , when I am particularly depressed , I ascribe our behavior to stupidity -- the stupidity of our leadership , the stupidity of our culture .
2007_01_01_1815784	25	Three decades ago , we suffered defeat in an unwinnable war against tribalism , the most fanatic of political emotions , fighting against a country about which we knew nothing and in which we had no vital interests .
2007_01_01_1815784	26	Vietnam was hopeless enough , but to repeat the same arrogant folly 30 years later in Iraq is unforgivable .
2007_01_01_1815784	27	The Swedish statesman Axel Oxenstierna famously said , '' Behold , my son , with how little wisdom the world is governed . ''
2007_01_01_1815784	28	A nation informed by a vivid understanding of the ironies of history is , I believe , best equipped to manage the tragic temptations of military power .
2007_01_01_1815784	29	Let us not bully our way through life , but let a growing sensitivity to history temper and civilize our use of power .
2007_01_01_1815784	30	In the meantime , let a thousand historical flowers bloom .
2007_01_01_1815784	31	History is never a closed book or a final verdict .
2007_01_01_1815784	32	It is forever in the making .
2007_01_01_1815784	33	Let historians never forsake the quest for knowledge in the interests of an ideology , a religion , a race , a nation .
2007_01_01_1815784	34	The great strength of history in a free society is its capacity for self-correction .
2007_01_01_1815784	35	This is the endless excitement of historical writing -- the search to reconstruct what went before , a quest illuminated by those ever-changing prisms that continually place old questions in a new light .
2007_01_01_1815784	36	History is a doomed enterprise that we happily pursue because of the thrill of the hunt , because exploring the past is such fun , because of the intellectual challenges involved , because a nation needs to know its own history .
2007_01_01_1815784	37	Or so we historians insist .
2007_01_01_1815784	38	Because in the end , a nation 's history must be both the guide and the domain not so much of its historians as its citizens .
2007_01_01_1815784	39	Op-Ed Contributor Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. , who has won Pulitzer Prizes for history and biography , is the author , most recently , of '' War and the American Presidency . ''
2007_01_01_1815785	0	Palestinian groups involved in holding an Israeli soldier who was captured in late June said Sunday that significant progress had been made toward a prisoner exchange that would release him .
2007_01_01_1815785	1	A spokesman in Gaza for the military wing of Hamas said Sunday that '' there is a breakthrough '' in the prisoner issue '' and we hope it will be concluded very soon . ''
2007_01_01_1815785	2	The spokesman , Abu Ubaida , suggested that a deal could be close for the release of Cpl. Gilad Shalit , captured by Hamas and two other militant groups in a raid into Israel on June 25 .
2007_01_01_1815785	3	A spokesman for the larger Hamas movement in Gaza , Fawzi Barhum , confirmed Sunday that '' there has been progress , '' while the Palestinian prime minister , Ismail Haniya , of Hamas , said last Thursday that the Israeli soldier would be freed soon .
2007_01_01_1815785	4	Egypt has spent months trying to broker a deal .
2007_01_01_1815785	5	But its efforts have been stymied repeatedly by the refusal of Hamas leaders in exile -- in particular Khaled Meshal , who heads the Hamas political bureau -- to sanction an agreement that would send Corporal Shalit home before hundreds of Palestinian prisoners are released .
2007_01_01_1815785	6	The government of Prime Minister Ehud Olmert of Israel played down the prospect of quick results .
2007_01_01_1815785	7	A spokeswoman for Mr. Olmert , Miri Eisin , said a release was not imminent and there remained '' problems , '' a view echoed by the Palestinian negotiator , Saeb Erekat .
2007_01_01_1815785	8	Mr. Olmert is to meet Thursday with President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt in Sharm el Sheik , Egypt , and there has been news media speculation that a deal could be announced there .
2007_01_01_1815785	9	The Egyptian foreign minister , Ahmed Aboul Gheit , said a prisoner exchange would be discussed at the meeting . ''
2007_01_01_1815785	10	The deal is ready , '' he told the London daily newspaper Al Hayat .
2007_01_01_1815785	11	But the deal '' awaits a Palestinian side capable of taking its own decisions . '' ''
2007_01_01_1815785	12	Once the decision is Palestinian , without foreign pressure , then the exchange will take place , '' Mr. Aboul Gheit said , an apparent and apparently bitter reference to the influence that Syria and Iran have over Mr. Meshal and the military wing of Hamas .
2007_01_01_1815785	13	Mr. Meshal lives in exile in Damascus , Syria , where the government has rebuffed all Western requests to close his office . ''
2007_01_01_1815785	14	The deal will be done once both sides agree on the overall deal Egypt has proposed and is trying to put into effect , '' Mr. Aboul Gheit said .
2007_01_01_1815785	15	The Egyptians have been working on a deal under which Corporal Shalit would be delivered into their hands .
2007_01_01_1815785	16	The Israelis , who will not deal directly with Hamas , would then begin to release some Palestinian prisoners , beginning with women and youngsters , with more to follow once the corporal is back in Israel .
2007_01_01_1815785	17	The total of Palestinian prisoners to be released has been described variously at 450 to 1,000 , including some who have served long sentences in Israeli prisons for serious offenses .
2007_01_01_1815785	18	The Israelis are always reluctant to release prisoners convicted of involvement in killing Israelis .
2007_01_01_1815785	19	Mr. Olmert is also trying to ensure that the Palestinian Authority president , Mahmoud Abbas of Fatah , gets credit for the swap , not the militants of Hamas and the Popular Resistance Committees who captured Corporal Shalit .
2007_01_01_1815785	20	The Palestinian groups put the onus on Israel . ''
2007_01_01_1815785	21	The swap depends on whether there is an Israeli intention to make it happen , '' said a spokesman for the Popular Resistance Committees , who calls himself Abu Mujahed .
2007_01_01_1815785	22	He said Corporal Shalit was in good health .
2007_01_01_1815785	23	The capture of the corporal resulted in a return of Israeli soldiers to the Gaza Strip , which they had left in 2005 .
2007_01_01_1815785	24	A bloody summer and autumn followed , with a series of Israeli incursions , continuing Palestinian rocket attacks into Israel from Gaza and fierce internal Palestinian fighting as Hamas and Fatah struggled for power .
2007_01_01_1815785	25	Mr. Olmert had made the release of Corporal Shalit a condition for a serious meeting with Mr. Abbas , but changed his mind as the situation deteriorated and Washington pressed for some political movement with Fatah .
2007_01_01_1815785	26	As of November , Israel was holding 9,075 Palestinian prisoners , including 345 minors , according to the independent Israeli human rights group B'Tselem .
2007_01_01_1815785	27	On Friday , the Israeli soldier 's father , Noam Shalit , published a letter in the Palestinian daily Al Quds , addressing his son and appealing to his captors .
2007_01_01_1815785	28	He wrote : '' The fact that we do n't know how you are , how you feel , how you are making it through the winter , and how the Palestinian organizations holding you are treating you , is very hard for us .
2007_01_01_1815785	29	They declare that you are a prisoner of war , but unfortunately , they are preventing you from receiving the rights to which you are entitled as a prisoner of war according to international law , and also according to the exalted Islamic law . ''
2007_01_01_1815785	30	Mr. Shalit then quoted verses from the Koran on the treatment of prisoners and said he hoped that during the Muslim feast of Id al-Adha , which began over the weekend , '' a change would take place in the position of the Palestinian organizations holding you , '' to enable the Palestinian families of prisoners held in Israel to soon see their relatives .
2007_01_01_1815785	31	He asked the captors to show his son the letter , which ends : '' Do n't break before you are released , which is very close , and we are doing all we can so that your release and the release of the Palestinian prisoners will be very close . ''
2007_01_01_1815787	0	A radio program on a government-run station has been conducting an open debate for the past month about whether Iran should change its tough stance on its nuclear program .
2007_01_01_1815787	1	The radio program , Goftegoo Radio , which went on the air last May , has used a debate format to broadcast discussions about any number of formerly taboo issues , but its recent fiery discussions about whether the country should have a nuclear program may be setting new boundaries for talk about one of the most important issues in Iran today .
2007_01_01_1815787	2	The United Nations Security Council voted unanimously on Dec. 23 to impose sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program , including barring trade in goods or technology used in the program .
2007_01_01_1815787	3	The measure is aimed at curbing Iran 's program for uranium enrichment , which can also be used for making a nuclear bomb .
2007_01_01_1815787	4	The Security Council has given Iran a two-month deadline to suspend its program or face tougher sanctions .
2007_01_01_1815787	5	Iran has refused to comply with the demand and has said it has the right to enrich uranium under the international Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty .
2007_01_01_1815787	6	It contends that its program is for peaceful energy purposes , but the United States and European nations contend that Tehran is trying to develop a nuclear arms program .
2007_01_01_1815787	7	Critics inside the country have long been barred from discussing the subject .
2007_01_01_1815787	8	Reformist newspapers cautiously warned last week that the sanctions could have dangerous consequences for the country .
2007_01_01_1815787	9	But they refrained from concluding whether enrichment should be suspended to prevent those consequences , apparently fearing that the mere suggestion could lead to a government move to close them down .
2007_01_01_1815787	10	But guests on Goftegoo -- which means dialogue in Persian -- have expressed their criticisms fearlessly , with some calling on the government to put the country 's other interests before its nuclear program .
2007_01_01_1815787	11	The state-owned broadcasting monopoly , which has great power and an enormous budget , is among the few state-run agencies that is not controlled by the government of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , who has refused to back down on the nuclear program in the face of world pressure .
2007_01_01_1815787	12	The broadcasting agency reports directly to Iran 's supreme religious leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , who has the final word on all state matters .
2007_01_01_1815787	13	The new director , Ezzatollah Zarghami , took over the agency in mid-2005 , as Mr. Ahmadinejad took office .
2007_01_01_1815787	14	Mr. Zarghami is a former general of the conservative Revolutionary Guards who is believed to be close to Ayatollah Khamenei .
2007_01_01_1815787	15	Analysts say Mr. Zarghami , who is not close to the president , may be using his closeness to Ayatollah Khamenei to build his own power base .
2007_01_01_1815787	16	But the motivation behind the political discussions on the program is not completely clear . ''
2007_01_01_1815787	17	Why have the officials linked the country 's development to the nuclear program ? ''
2007_01_01_1815787	18	Sadeq Zibakalam , a professor of political science at Tehran University who has appeared on the show a number of times , asked on a show three weeks ago . ''
2007_01_01_1815787	19	Why have they tried to convince people with the wrong notion that if we suspend our program we lose our national identity and our independence ? ''
2007_01_01_1815787	20	He said Iran was a developing country whose hospitals and schools still needed major investment .
2007_01_01_1815787	21	He said spending huge amounts of money for the country 's nuclear program -- without mentioning the costs of sanctions or a military confrontation -- would not contribute to the country 's development .
2007_01_01_1815787	22	Mr. Zibakalam said in an interview that he agreed to appear as a guest on the show only if he could express his opinion freely .
2007_01_01_1815787	23	His condition was immediately accepted , he said .
2007_01_01_1815787	24	The host of the show , Amir Dabirimehr , a 29-year old doctoral candidate in political science , said the purpose of the program was to allow critics to express their opinions . ''
2007_01_01_1815787	25	The show wants to provide an opportunity for all ideas to be expressed on the state-run media so that they do n't turn to other outlets , '' he said . ''
2007_01_01_1815787	26	We tell our speakers that they are our guests and we will be responsible for whatever they say . ''
2007_01_01_1815787	27	Many of the people he has invited to appear have been skeptical of his guarantees , though , and have turned down the invitation . ''
2007_01_01_1815787	28	I welcome the show but it could be dangerous if the state-run media wants to carry the mantle for free speech , '' said Mahmoud Shamsolvaezin , a veteran journalist and media analyst in Tehran . ''
2007_01_01_1815787	29	If the government really wants to broadcast the voices of its critics , it should let them have their own publications . ''
2007_01_01_1815787	30	Over a hundred reformist newspapers that criticized the government have been shut down by the authorities , and dozens of journalists have been jailed in recent years .
2007_01_01_1815787	31	Many people watch satellite programs beamed from the United States by opposition groups in exile .
2007_01_01_1815787	32	Satellite television is banned in Iran , but many people ignore the law .
2007_01_01_1815787	33	Radio and television channels operated in Iran are controlled by the government agency , whose director is appointed by Ayatollah Khamenei .
2007_01_01_1815787	34	Goftegoo Radio , a daily show , devotes one or two programs a week to political subjects .
2007_01_01_1815787	35	It usually has at least two guests , one advocate and one opponent of the subject of the day 's debate .
2007_01_01_1815787	36	On a program last week , Mr. Zibakalam challenged Yadollah Javani , a senior member of the Revolutionary Guards and an ardent advocate of Iran 's nuclear program .
2007_01_01_1815787	37	Mr. Javani brushed off the sanctions as insignificant and repeated the government line that the United States was manipulating the Security Council against Iran .
2007_01_01_1815787	38	Mr. Zibakalam , in response , said , '' I do n't know if you really believe in what you say or you just say that to people . ''
2007_01_01_1815787	39	He noted that Iran 's government had sponsored a conference of Holocaust doubters in Tehran in December and said that it was natural to expect Germany to vote against Iran at the Security Council meeting with that kind of provocation . ''
2007_01_01_1815787	40	Every time we have to deal with the consequences of our actions , we bring up ideological arguments , '' he said . ''
2007_01_01_1815787	41	I believe these sanctions are only the tip of the iceberg , and they can have very severe consequences if we do n't deal with them within the next two months , '' he warned .
2007_01_01_1815789	0	When Ban Ki-moon takes over as secretary general of the United Nations on Monday , he may quickly have to grapple with the crisis in Darfur , fighting in Somalia and the continuing strife in the Middle East .
2007_01_01_1815789	1	But he will have to wait to enjoy one of the more glamorous trappings of his new post : the secretary general 's official residence on Sutton Place , the exclusive Manhattan enclave off the East River .
2007_01_01_1815789	2	The General Assembly recently approved a $ 4.5 million renovation of the residence , a 14,000-square-foot neo-Georgian attached town house with four floors and a basement .
2007_01_01_1815789	3	Until October , when the work is expected to be completed , Mr. Ban and his wife will sleep and entertain in a suite at the Waldorf-Astoria , where they have been living since November .
2007_01_01_1815789	4	Choi Soung-ah , who has been serving as a spokeswoman during Mr. Ban 's transition , said that while he would have preferred to move directly into the Sutton Place residence , '' it 's just essential refurbishment that 's been pushed off for years . '' ''
2007_01_01_1815789	5	He would rather , of course , be in the official residence and not living in a hotel where he ca n't really unpack his own things , his own belongings , '' Ms. Choi said . ''
2007_01_01_1815789	6	There is such a thing as the official residence of the secretary general .
2007_01_01_1815789	7	Of course that would be better , and it would be very convenient . ''
2007_01_01_1815789	8	The residence was once home to Anne Morgan , the daughter of J. P. Morgan , the financier .
2007_01_01_1815789	9	It was donated to the United Nations in 1972 and has not been significantly refurbished since 1950 , according to a September report prepared by the secretary general 's office .
2007_01_01_1815789	10	The report estimated that the renovation effort would cost $ 4.49 million .
2007_01_01_1815789	11	Of that , $ 650,900 would go toward security upgrades , including $ 137,700 for a digital video-recording system and additional cameras .
2007_01_01_1815789	12	The price includes $ 200,000 to upgrade the kitchen , $ 100,000 to redo the restrooms and $ 2.1 million for a central heating , ventilation and air-conditioning system .
2007_01_01_1815789	13	The upgrades that are not related to security total $ 255 per square foot .
2007_01_01_1815789	14	The General Assembly also approved $ 202,500 for temporary accommodations for the incoming secretary general and his family .
2007_01_01_1815789	15	Details in the report hint at the sort of domestic annoyances the departing secretary general , Kofi Annan , has dealt with since he took up the post in 1997 .
2007_01_01_1815789	16	The house currently '' poses safety hazards '' and is prone to '' severe malfunctions , requiring increasingly frequent emergency repairs , '' the report says .
2007_01_01_1815789	17	Specifically , it describes a '' technologically obsolete '' telecommunications system , an 85-year-old electrical wiring system unequipped to handle the phalanx of communications and security technology required by a modern world leader and an elevator that violates New York City 's safety code .
2007_01_01_1815789	18	The building is heated with steam , which frequently leaks from '' heavily corroded '' pipes and fittings , the secretary general 's report says , damaging walls and furniture .
2007_01_01_1815789	19	The high-powered fans that are used to address the leaks sometimes make matters worse , by overloading the electrical circuit and causing power failures .
2007_01_01_1815789	20	The General Assembly has also approved a separate , extensive renovation of the United Nations headquarters , which is expected to cost $ 1.9 billion and take seven years .
2007_01_01_1815789	21	In the meantime , Mr. Ban , the former South Korean foreign minister , will not have to wait to move into his new office , on the 38th floor of the gleaming Secretariat building .
2007_01_01_1815789	22	He will do so starting Monday , but not a moment sooner , Ms. Choi said , noting , '' Kofi Annan is still the secretary general until the 31st of December . ''
2007_01_01_1815790	0	A year ago , as the Mendez-Rojas family slept on New Year 's Day after a night of celebrating , a fire was spreading in the walls of their studio apartment on Gerard Avenue in the South Bronx .
2007_01_01_1815790	1	At 10 a.m. , a neighbor who had gone to throw out the garbage saw smoke .
2007_01_01_1815790	2	She woke up the Mendez-Rojas family , who gathered their documents -- precious possessions for immigrants -- and left the building .
2007_01_01_1815790	3	When they returned later in the day , they found wires hanging out of human-size holes in the walls , clouds peeking through the ceiling and most of their belongings scattered under ash and water .
2007_01_01_1815790	4	Almost a year later , as Rosanna Rojas , 40 , and her daughter , Roxana Mendez , 14 , gave a tour of their new apartment in the Mitchell Houses in the Mott Haven section of the Bronx , they pointed out the few possessions that survived the fire .
2007_01_01_1815790	5	There is Ms. Rojas 's industrial-size sewing machine , a boombox , and the framed picture of a Frank Lloyd Wright building that Ms. Rojas drew years ago while studying to be an architect in the Dominican Republic , the family 's home country .
2007_01_01_1815790	6	Johnny Mendez , 42 , her husband , showed two of his water-damaged law books .
2007_01_01_1815790	7	They also like to point out where each item in the house came from .
2007_01_01_1815790	8	A family they met in the Ruth Fernandez Family Center , the shelter where they lived for seven months after the fire , gave them a bedroom set .
2007_01_01_1815790	9	Ms. Rojas split the pieces among the family : she and Mr. Mendez took the bed , Roxana got the bureau , and Jonathan , 17 , got the nightstands .
2007_01_01_1815790	10	A friend gave the family bunk beds , which Ms. Rojas separated for her children . ''
2007_01_01_1815790	11	If it 's good , it does n't have anything to do with the fire , I 'll take it , '' Ms. Rojas said .
2007_01_01_1815790	12	Ms. Rojas moved to New York in 1990 in hopes of earning money for the family , leaving her husband and son behind .
2007_01_01_1815790	13	She traveled back and forth while Mr. Mendez practiced law in the Dominican Republic .
2007_01_01_1815790	14	She gave birth to Roxana there two years later and brought the baby with her to the United States , where she worked in various textile factories through the years and got her immigration status in order .
2007_01_01_1815790	15	The rest of the family joined them in 2000 , although Mr. Mendez -- who is a legal resident of the United States , though not a citizen like the others in his family -- continued to split his time between New York and the Dominican Republic until October 2005 , when he decided to stay in New York permanently . ''
2007_01_01_1815790	16	We were in a studio , but we were stable , '' Ms. Rojas said , speaking about the apartment that was destroyed by the fire .
2007_01_01_1815790	17	The couple decided that Ms. Rojas would continue working while Mr. Mendez studied for a law degree that would let him practice in the United States .
2007_01_01_1815790	18	Now , she works four days a week sewing curtains for C. J. Dellatore Textile , while Mr. Mendez takes English classes five nights a week at LaGuardia Community College in Long Island City , Queens , in preparation for a standardized English exam .
2007_01_01_1815790	19	He greets the children when they get home from school and cooks hearty Dominican meals for the family .
2007_01_01_1815790	20	He makes a mean pork chop .
2007_01_01_1815790	21	Explaining the couple 's decision to sacrifice some comforts by having Mr. Mendez study rather than work , Ms. Rojas said , '' I 'm a little strained , but if we spend the rest of our lives in a factory , then it 's not a good future . ''
2007_01_01_1815790	22	The children attend the Manhattan Center for Science and Mathematics , a public high school in East Harlem .
2007_01_01_1815790	23	When their belongings were destroyed in the fire , they were the most worried about their books .
2007_01_01_1815790	24	But they never missed a day of school .
2007_01_01_1815790	25	A guidance counselor who learned that they had lost everything referred them to the Children 's Aid Society , one of seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund .
2007_01_01_1815790	26	Yalenis Cruz , the aid society 's coordinator at the school , immediately dipped into the fund and gave the family $ 500 for clothes , toiletries and other basic household items .
2007_01_01_1815790	27	Ms. Rojas recently bought a couch and will be reimbursed with money from the fund .
2007_01_01_1815790	28	Despite having lost everything , the Mendez-Rojas family is optimistic , and concerned more with the future than with the past .
2007_01_01_1815790	29	After living in the shelter , Roxana decided that she wanted to be a doctor rather than a fashion designer , so she could help people .
2007_01_01_1815790	30	Jonathan is waiting to hear back from the colleges he applied to .
2007_01_01_1815790	31	He expects to enroll in City College in the fall and wants to be a computer systems engineer .
2007_01_01_1815790	32	Mr. Mendez expects to be practicing criminal law in New York by 2010 .
2007_01_01_1815790	33	And Ms. Rojas is waiting for all of these dreams to become reality so that she can complete her final year of school and receive her degree in architecture .

2007_01_01_1815791	0	A mother and her adult son were shot inside their family 's basement apartment in Coram , N.Y. , on Saturday , the police said .
2007_01_01_1815791	1	She was killed and he was badly wounded .
2007_01_01_1815791	2	The woman , Amelia Garcia , and her son , Ferneliz Cruz , were found in the kitchen of the apartment on Marie Lane , an otherwise quiet dead-end street in a working-class Suffolk County town of 35,000 residents , about 50 miles east of New York City .
2007_01_01_1815791	3	Ms. Garcia , 52 , and Mr. Cruz , 30 , were the only ones in the white two-family Cape at the time of the shooting , said Detective Sgt. Edward Fandrey of the Suffolk County Police .
2007_01_01_1815791	4	There were no signs of forced entry and the apartment had not been ransacked , Sergeant Fandrey said .
2007_01_01_1815791	5	Mr. Cruz lived there with his mother , his wife and their two children , an 8-year-old boy and a baby , according to neighbors and the police .
2007_01_01_1815791	6	Another family lives on the first floor .

2007_01_01_1815791	9	This is a normal family , by all accounts , that has been thrust into a tragedy , '' Sergeant Fandrey said .
2007_01_01_1815791	10	Mr. Cruz was listed in critical condition last night at Stony Brook University Hospital , the police said .
2007_01_01_1815791	11	He works for a Wonder Bread distributor and his wife has a part-time job with McDonald 's , Sergeant Fandrey said .
2007_01_01_1815791	12	Investigators were still not sure if more than one gunman took part in the shooting or if anything had been stolen from the apartment . ''
2007_01_01_1815791	13	We 're still processing the scene and we 're continuing to evaluate the evidence as we go , but at this point , we do n't know the motive , '' Sergeant Fandrey said yesterday afternoon .
2007_01_01_1815791	14	There are only 10 houses on Marie Lane , but neighbors said that they did not know Mr. Cruz or his family well .
2007_01_01_1815791	15	They have lived for two years in the basement apartment , which has three windows and a single entrance , a side door down a few narrow steps .
2007_01_01_1815791	16	One neighbor , Denise Galloway , who has lived on the block for 17 years , said that her son often played with Mr. Cruz 's son as Mr. Cruz 's mother , Ms. Garcia , stood watch .
2007_01_01_1815791	17	Ms. Galloway and Ms. Garcia were not able to hold a conversation , though ; a native Spanish speaker , Ms. Garcia could not speak English .
2007_01_01_1815791	18	Sergeant Fandrey would not disclose the number of shots fired inside the apartment or the type of gun or guns used in the assault .
2007_01_01_1815791	19	He also did not comment on how many times Mr. Cruz and Ms. Garcia had been shot , or where they had been hit . ''
2007_01_01_1815791	20	It 's all part of the investigation , '' he said .
2007_01_01_1815791	21	Anyone with information is asked to call the Suffolk County Homicide Squad at (631) 852-6392 .
2007_01_01_1815791	22	The calls are kept confidential , the police said .
2007_01_01_1815792	0	As a New Year 's deadline arrived , Russia 's natural gas monopoly , Gazprom , struck a deal early Monday to supply gas to Belarus for the next five years , averting a price dispute that threatened to disrupt supplies to Europe , the company said in a statement .
2007_01_01_1815792	1	The agreement , reached as the Russian capital celebrated the New Year with rolling displays of fireworks , more than doubled the price that Belarus will pay for natural gas this year and raised it significantly in the years to come .
2007_01_01_1815792	2	For Belarus , a close ally of Russia , the price of gas would rise to $ 100 per thousand cubic meters in 2007 , from $ 46 now , and increase steadily to the level paid by European countries by 2011 , the company said .
2007_01_01_1815792	3	Gazprom , Russia 's largest company , succeeded in achieving , at least in part , what its officials had described as a central goal : ending subsidized supplies of energy to the countries of the former Soviet Union .
2007_01_01_1815792	4	Belarus , led by its autocratic president , Aleksandr G. Lukashenko , has for years benefited from the comparatively inexpensive supply of natural gas , a vital part of its sclerotic economy , still mostly managed by the state .
2007_01_01_1815792	5	The agreement headed off a shutdown of supplies to Belarus and beyond , avoiding the disruptions of last year , when the effects of a price dispute with Ukraine rippled throughout Europe and raised concerns about Russia 's reliability as an energy supplier .
2007_01_01_1815792	6	Gazprom , closely allied to the Kremlin , threatened to cut off gas supplies again beginning Monday at 10 a.m. if Belarus did not agree to the higher prices .
2007_01_01_1815792	7	At least 20 percent of Russian natural gas destined for Europe passes through Belarus , less than the amount that transits Ukraine but enough to raise new concerns in Europe .
2007_01_01_1815792	8	The agreement was reached after months of negotiations -- and a final week of threats and counterthreats .
2007_01_01_1815792	9	Belarus 's prime minister , Sergei S. Sidorsky , arrived in Moscow on Sunday for a last round of negotiations and announced the deal with Gazprom 's chairman , Aleksei B. Miller .
2007_01_01_1815792	10	Mr. Miller had suggested that Belarus should ultimately pay the going market price , now roughly $ 260 per thousand cubic meters of gas .
2007_01_01_1815792	11	The agreed price , $ 100 per thousand cubic meters , was less than the $ 105 that Gazprom had demanded in the past few days .
2007_01_01_1815792	12	But under the deal announced on Monday , Gazprom , in keeping with its stated goals of expanding its export empire , will acquire 50 percent of Beltranzgaz , the Belarussian gas-transit monopoly that distributes gas through the country .
2007_01_01_1815792	13	Mr. Lukashenko , whose rule has been described as the last dictatorship in Europe , had previously vowed never to give up control of those pipelines .
2007_01_01_1815792	14	On Friday , he vowed that Belarussians would rather live in unheated dugouts than pay the higher prices that Gazprom was demanding . ''
2007_01_01_1815792	15	All this means destruction of our relations , '' he said .
2007_01_01_1815792	16	A statement by Mr. Sidorsky early Monday appeared to reflect his government 's unease with the agreement . ''
2007_01_01_1815792	17	The Belarussian side , in a difficult atmosphere on the eve of the new year , signed an agreement on unfortunate terms , '' he said , according to Agence France-Presse .
2007_01_01_1815792	18	Russia has long been the country 's most reliable partner , shielding it from efforts by Europe and the United States to isolate Mr. Lukashenko , who won re-election to a third term as president in balloting in March that was denounced as unfair .
2007_01_01_1815792	19	But the negotiations suggested that Russia 's political priorities had been surpassed by Gazprom 's economic ones .
2007_01_01_1815793	0	Nine small bombs exploded around Bangkok overnight , killing two people and wounding 34 people in a city that remains under martial law after a coup three months ago .
2007_01_01_1815793	1	There was no immediate claim of responsibility .
2007_01_01_1815793	2	New Year 's celebrations were officially canceled in Bangkok and in the northern city of Chiang Mai .
2007_01_01_1815793	3	But when midnight struck , cheers went up in Bangkok and the sky was filled with bursts of fireworks .
2007_01_01_1815793	4	Six of those wounded were foreigners , the police said , including one American .
2007_01_01_1815793	5	The national police chief said he doubted that Muslim insurgents from southern Thailand were involved in the bombings , leaving the likelihood that the violence was tied to the country 's continuing political tensions .
2007_01_01_1815793	6	Thaksin Shinawatra was ousted as prime minister in a nonviolent coup on Sept. 19 , and the junta has said there is a continuing threat of instability from his backers .
2007_01_01_1815793	7	The civilian government it appointed approved funds last week for a 14,000-member special operations force to maintain civic order . ''
2007_01_01_1815793	8	The bombs exploded almost simultaneously , '' said Gen. Surayud Chulanont , the interim prime minister , as he visited the wounded at a hospital on Sunday . ''
2007_01_01_1815793	9	It must have been planned . ''
2007_01_01_1815793	10	But he said it was too early to conclude who was responsible .
2007_01_01_1815793	11	Police officers were sent to guard the sites of the bombings and to secure other possible targets .
2007_01_01_1815793	12	Hotels tightened security , shopping malls closed early and the police cleared Khao San Road , a street that is closed to traffic where backpackers from around the world gather to celebrate the New Year .
2007_01_01_1815793	13	The national police chief , Gen. Ajirawit Suphanaphesat , said that at least six bombs had exploded and that the police were inspecting suspicious packages in several other areas .
2007_01_01_1815793	14	Officials said two people had been killed and as many as 26 wounded in scattered locations that included a bus stop , a parking area near a shopping mall , a small open market and two police posts .
2007_01_01_1815793	15	Bangkok 's mayor , Apirak Kosayothin , closed a New Year 's celebration in a public square more than three hours early and said other public countdowns would also be canceled . ''
2007_01_01_1815793	16	Due to several bomb explosions in Bangkok and for the sake of peace and security , I would ask all of you to return to your homes now , '' he told a crowd of 5,000 people .
2007_01_01_1815793	17	The police then began clearing the square .
2007_01_01_1815793	18	Crowds remained in the streets for some time , however , waving at the cameras from behind television reporters at the scenes of some of the bombings . ''
2007_01_01_1815793	19	Police reinforcements have been sent to various areas in the city , '' said the government 's spokesman , Yongyuth Malyalarp . ''
2007_01_01_1815793	20	We urge the public to remain calm , continue with the celebration but at the same time keep a lookout for any irregularities . ''
2007_01_01_1815793	21	An insurgency in the three largely Muslim provinces of southern Thailand has taken more than 1,900 lives over the past two years .
2007_01_01_1815793	22	Shootings and bombings have become an almost daily occurrence .
2007_01_01_1815793	23	But so far , the violence from that insurgency appears not to have spread to Bangkok and other parts of the country .
2007_01_01_1815793	24	The southern violence appears to have a number of causes .
2007_01_01_1815793	25	The ethnic Malay Muslims have complained over the years of neglect and discrimination by officials in the distant capital in this largely Buddhist nation .
2007_01_01_1815793	26	Thailand 's political crisis did not end with the coup , which brought to a halt a period of mounting tension that included large demonstrations against the prime minister earlier in the year .
2007_01_01_1815793	27	Mr. Thaksin was abroad at the time , and the question of his possible return continues to preoccupy people here .
2007_01_01_1815793	28	The junta has said its interim government will draw up a new constitution in preparation for an election late next year .
2007_01_01_1815793	29	But it has delayed lifting martial law , saying unidentified '' undercurrents '' of pro-Thaksin opposition continue to present a threat .
2007_01_01_1815793	30	Abhisit Vejjajiva , the leader of the minority Democrat Party , said Saturday that he expected Mr. Thaksin 's supporters to step up political attacks on the military-backed government in the coming year .
2007_01_01_1815793	31	He referred to recent accusations of corruption against General Surayud , the interim prime minister , and said , '' Such fighting will be more fierce next year . ''
2007_01_01_1815795	0	City , state and federal agencies granted final approvals last month to a half-dozen wide-ranging projects in a political aligning of the stars that will promote New York City 's most ambitious economic development agenda in decades .
2007_01_01_1815795	1	Approval or financing was given to a Second Avenue subway ; an extension of the Flushing Line to the Far West Side ; a spur to connect the Long Island Rail Road to Grand Central Terminal ; financing for tens of thousands of apartments for low - and moderate-income residents ; the Atlantic Yards complex near Downtown Brooklyn , which includes a new home for the basketball Nets ; and even the bus-stop shelters and public toilets that New Yorkers and visitors have demanded for years .
2007_01_01_1815795	2	Some of the approvals were prompted by legal deadlines and last-minute efforts by departing Pataki administration officials -- including Charles A. Gargano , the chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation ; Peter S. Kalikow , the chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority ; and the governor himself -- to stake out their legacy .
2007_01_01_1815795	3	But two more enduring forces also converged : the beginning of the last 1,000 days of the Bloomberg administration , and a climate that some urban planners suggest signals at least a lull in the nearly half-century backlash against the bulldozer diplomacy of Robert Moses . ''
2007_01_01_1815795	4	It 's a pretty amazing list , '' said Robert D. Yaro , the president of the Regional Plan Association , a group that studies transportation and development issues . ''
2007_01_01_1815795	5	It 's the Bloomberg administration pushing hard .
2007_01_01_1815795	6	There 's a pro-growth , long-range theme behind all this . ''
2007_01_01_1815795	7	Kenneth T. Jackson , the Columbia University urban historian , said that Mr. Bloomberg 's speech in December outlining the challenges posed by a growing population '' signaled that New York had to fight for its place at the table , that real estate and commercial rents and housing prices are getting out of hand .
2007_01_01_1815795	8	The only way the city can prosper is to make that more reasonable and the only way to do that is to increase the supply . ''
2007_01_01_1815795	9	I think they 're beginning to move , '' Professor Jackson said .
2007_01_01_1815795	10	In the months ahead , the Bloomberg administration 's development agenda includes rezoning in Harlem as well as in Jamaica and Willets Point in Queens .
2007_01_01_1815795	11	The administration also wants to make another effort to gain approval for the transformation of the James A. Farley general post office building in Midtown Manhattan into a commuter rail hub called Moynihan Station -- one proposal that appears to be in political limbo . ''
2007_01_01_1815795	12	After 9/11 , a spirit of cooperation -- not perfect -- prevailed that enabled people to aim farther than they had in decades , '' said Daniel L. Doctoroff , the deputy mayor for economic development , who was instrumental in winning many of the approvals . ''
2007_01_01_1815795	13	The mayor really encouraged that kind of thinking -- repositioning New York City 's economy to compete with other cities in the 21st century . ''
2007_01_01_1815795	14	Several of the approved projects still face court challenges .
2007_01_01_1815795	15	Some others are bound to raise concerns over displacement and congestion .
2007_01_01_1815795	16	And the promise of a Second Avenue subway has been dangled before skeptical New Yorkers for nearly 80 years .
2007_01_01_1815795	17	But even if some projects are delayed , the others would change the city 's face and , arguably , help fend off competition from New Jersey and from other world capitals . ''
2007_01_01_1815795	18	I think you probably would have to go back to the late 1930s to see anything like that , '' Mr. Doctoroff said . ''
2007_01_01_1815795	19	I do n't think any mayor has had an agenda like this , not since La Guardia . ''
2007_01_01_1815795	20	On Dec. 6 , the city sold $ 2 billion in bonds to extend the No. 7 subway line 1.1 miles west and then south from Times Square to 11th Avenue and 34th Street to help transform the largely fallow Far West Side .
2007_01_01_1815795	21	On Dec. 18 , the federal government agreed to grant $ 2.6 billion to link Long Island Rail Road commuters directly to the East Side of Manhattan and $ 693 million for the Second Avenue subway from 96th to 63rd Streets .
2007_01_01_1815795	22	On Dec. 19 , Mr. Pataki presided over the installation of the first two huge steel columns to mark the perimeter of the Freedom Tower at the World Trade Center site .
2007_01_01_1815795	23	The same day , Mr. Bloomberg announced the installation of the first 24 of 3,300 bus-stop shelters by a company that will also replace 330 newsstands and install and operate 20 public toilets .
2007_01_01_1815795	24	The '' street furniture '' will help pay for the city 's tourism campaign .
2007_01_01_1815795	25	On Dec. 20 , the City Council , in a compromise supported by the mayor , voted to overhaul a tax break to induce developers to build tens of thousands of apartments for New Yorkers making less than 80 percent of the median household income , or $ 56,720 for a family of four .
2007_01_01_1815795	26	That day , a state oversight board gave final approval to the $ 4 billion Atlantic Yards project , a mostly residential complex with a basketball arena , offices and retail space near Flatbush and Atlantic Avenues .
2007_01_01_1815795	27	In addition , new stadiums are being built for the Yankees and the Mets .
2007_01_01_1815795	28	Brad Lander , the director of the Pratt Center for Community Development , a planning group , said : '' My guess is , we are only just now settling into the general sense that the city 's growth and development are long-term trends , not a short-time , business-cycle flash . ''
2007_01_01_1815795	29	Dick Dadey , the executive director of Citizens Union , said that the city , bolstered by a robust economy , was trying to meet pent-up demand . ''
2007_01_01_1815795	30	Say what you want about the scope and size of development , '' he added , '' the projects that are being approved are more sensitive to the current communities and neighborhoods or to creating new ones -- like the new Downtown Brooklyn -- than Moses ever was . ''
2007_01_01_1815795	31	Moreover , Mr. Dadey said , '' the community boards no longer have the sway they once did over stopping local projects , '' and some local groups are even supporting development -- '' trying to encourage it responsibly in ways that benefit a greater number of people . ''
2007_01_01_1815795	32	In '' The Power Broker , '' Robert A. Caro in 1974 wrote that without the approval of Robert Moses , who oversaw virtually all public works in New York until he was eased out in 1968 , the city was '' utterly unable '' to build anything .
2007_01_01_1815795	33	Mr. Caro said in an interview that he , too , was struck by the plethora of projects approved in December . ''
2007_01_01_1815795	34	Does this alignment of stars show that this is may be a problem that democracy can solve ? ''
2007_01_01_1815795	35	For the first time in 40 years , I 'm hopeful . ''

2007_01_01_1815796	7	For Nebraska , this game provides another chance to show that the program is inching back toward prominence under Bill Callahan .

2007_01_01_1815802	0	Darlene Bishop , the nationally renowned evangelical preacher , begins her book about how God cured the cancer afflicting one of her brothers with a Biblical verse : '' And the prayer of faith shall save the sick , and the Lord shall raise him up . ''
2007_01_01_1815802	1	The book , '' Your Life Follows Your Words , '' is sold in the gift shop of Solid Rock Church , the 4,000-member congregation in Monroe , Ohio , where Ms. Bishop is a co-pastor .
2007_01_01_1815802	2	She has promoted it on her television show , '' Sisters , '' which is modeled after ABC 's '' The View '' and is broadcast on four cable networks nationwide .
2007_01_01_1815802	3	On her Web site , Ms. Bishop promises that the book reveals '' how God healed her of breast cancer '' and a brother of throat cancer .
2007_01_01_1815802	4	Nowhere , though , does she mention , that the brother , Darrell Perry , a successful country music songwriter whom everyone called Wayne , died from the cancer a year and a half ago .
2007_01_01_1815802	5	In a sworn deposition responding to two lawsuits filed by Mr. Perry 's four children , Ms. Bishop stated that no doctor ever diagnosed the breast cancer she referred to prominently in her book .
2007_01_01_1815802	6	Instead , Ms. Bishop testified , she thought that she had cancer in 1986 and that it was cured . ''
2007_01_01_1815802	7	She 's lying to people and exploiting my father for her own financial gain , '' Mr. Perry 's eldest son , Bryan Perry , 36 , said in an interview .
2007_01_01_1815802	8	One lawsuit accuses Ms. Bishop of wrongful death because , it says , she convinced Mr. Perry to pray rather than to seek medical care .
2007_01_01_1815802	9	The other accuses her of mismanaging and misusing his estate , which the Perry children say could be worth millions .
2007_01_01_1815802	10	The estate case is to be argued in Butler County Probate Court on Friday .
2007_01_01_1815802	11	Mr. Perry 's death at age 55 left some of country music 's most popular performers , including Toby Keith and Tim McGraw , without one of their most trusted and prolific writers .
2007_01_01_1815802	12	Now the battle over who caused his death , who owns his assets and how best to interpret his legacy is dividing a once-close family whose members climbed from Appalachian poverty to prominence in the music industry and the evangelical movement .
2007_01_01_1815802	13	Ms. Bishop would not answer questions about the suits .
2007_01_01_1815802	14	On her Web site , she says that the allegations '' are complete lies '' and that she never discourages anyone from seeing doctors .
2007_01_01_1815802	15	She also says she is a trustworthy steward of Mr. Perry 's estate , which , she said in the deposition , could be worth nothing after his many debts are paid .
2007_01_01_1815802	16	Long before she gained fame as a preacher , Ms. Bishop was her family 's spiritual leader , Bryan Perry said .
2007_01_01_1815802	17	One of Mr. Perry 's two former wives , Janet Perry-McCormick , said that he often sought the religious counsel of his older sister , whom he called Sissy , and that his children grew up attending her church . ''
2007_01_01_1815802	18	I put my faith in Darlene , '' Bryan Perry said . ''
2007_01_01_1815802	19	We thought she was a holy , pure woman . ''
2007_01_01_1815802	20	Wayne Perry fathered four children with three women , two of whom he married , his sons said .
2007_01_01_1815802	21	He abandoned his family when Bryan was 2 to pursue his songwriting career , which produced such hits as '' A Woman 's Touch , '' recorded by Mr. Keith , and '' Not a Moment Too Soon , '' by Mr. McGraw .
2007_01_01_1815802	22	He earned millions of dollars , said a music industry lawyer , Rush Hicks , who is advising the children .
2007_01_01_1815802	23	After doctors diagnosed his throat cancer in December 2002 , Mr. Perry moved into Ms. Bishop 's mansion on her $ 2.6 million horse farm in Monroe to re-commit his life to God , his sons said .
2007_01_01_1815802	24	According to Ms. Bishop 's book , when her brother arrived at her front door , he confirmed that he had cancer , and she replied , '' Let that be the last time those words ever come from your mouth . ''
2007_01_01_1815802	25	In her deposition , Ms. Bishop said Mr. Perry had decided on his own to disregard doctors ' advice that he immediately begin chemotherapy and radiation treatments .
2007_01_01_1815802	26	But Mr. Perry 's children contend that their aunt persuaded him to forgo medical treatment and rely on a process of faith healing that , Ms. Bishop wrote in her book , God had explained to her in a revelation . ''
2007_01_01_1815802	27	He was laying in bed dying , and she had him convinced that he was healed , '' said Mr. Perry 's son Justin Jones , 28 , who lived in Ms. Bishop 's house for a year caring for his father .
2007_01_01_1815802	28	As his throat tumors swelled to the size of tennis balls , Mr. Perry stopped eating , Mr. Jones said .
2007_01_01_1815802	29	His weight dropped to 84 pounds .
2007_01_01_1815802	30	He did consent to chemotherapy , Mr. Jones said , but only after the tumors had restricted his breathing to the point that he collapsed .
2007_01_01_1815802	31	The chemotherapy shrank the tumors , Mr. Jones said , and his father began eating again .
2007_01_01_1815802	32	In her book , Ms. Bishop describes her brother 's spiritual awakening and the improvement in his condition , but she does not mention his chemotherapy .
2007_01_01_1815802	33	As Mr. Perry regained strength , he and Ms. Bishop went on a nationwide tour of evangelical churches , promoting Ms. Bishop 's book about his miraculous recovery , his children said .
2007_01_01_1815802	34	Against his doctor 's advice , Mr. Perry stopped chemotherapy , Mr. Jones said .
2007_01_01_1815802	35	On Oct. 13 , 2004 , an oncologist , Dr. Albert Malcolm , wrote a letter telling Mr. Perry that his cancer was terminal .
2007_01_01_1815802	36	Mr. Perry forwarded the letter to Janet Perry-McCormick , his former wife , after writing across the top , '' Destroy this letter after you read it , '' and , '' Only you and Darlene know this . ''
2007_01_01_1815802	37	The note is proof that Ms. Bishop knew her brother was dying but concealed it from the public while continuing to promote her book , Mr. Perry 's children said in interviews , but in her deposition , Ms. Bishop said she learned of Dr. Malcolm 's diagnosis after Mr. Perry died in May 2005 .
2007_01_01_1815802	38	Mr. Perry 's death raised questions about the ownership of his royalties , his catalogs of songs and his '' hook book , '' which his children describe as a loose-leaf notebook stuffed with lyrics and musical riffs , most of which had not been recorded .
2007_01_01_1815802	39	The children accused Ms. Bishop 's son Lawrence Bishop II , a musician , of recording two albums that contained a total of five songs copyrighted by Mr. Perry without paying royalties to his estate .
2007_01_01_1815802	40	Copyrights are not strictly followed in the Christian country music business , Ms. Bishop said in her deposition .
2007_01_01_1815802	41	She also said Mr. Perry 's notebook was missing .
2007_01_01_1815802	42	Their father 's songs could be worth millions of dollars , the children said , but only if they can be marketed , an impossibility given no hook book and a dispute over song rights .
2007_01_01_1815802	43	Ms. Bishop said Mr. Perry 's catalogs of songs belonged to the record companies that recorded and promoted them , not the family .
2007_01_01_1815802	44	Also in dispute is Mr. Perry 's life insurance policy , worth $ 260,000 .
2007_01_01_1815802	45	Ms. Bishop was named the policy 's sole beneficiary , but the children claim it was meant for them .
2007_01_01_1815802	46	One point on which both sides agree is that Mr. Perry died believing he had been healed by God . ''
2007_01_01_1815802	47	The only thing he told me , '' Ms. Perry-McCormick said , '' was , ` I 'm going to show Sissy that I can be healed just like she was . ' ''
2007_01_01_1815803	0	Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. made judicial pay the sole topic of his second annual report , issued on Sunday , declaring that the failure by Congress to raise federal judges ' salaries in recent years has become a '' constitutional crisis '' that puts the future of the federal courts in jeopardy .
2007_01_01_1815803	1	He noted that judges had fallen well behind the American labor force as a whole in keeping up with inflation over the past 25 years , with judges ' pay having declined by 23.9 percent since 1969 , adjusted for inflation , while the national average for all wages rose by 17.8 percent .
2007_01_01_1815803	2	Given such a '' dramatic erosion of judicial compensation , '' the chief justice said , it was '' clear that the time is ripe for our nation 's judges to receive a substantial salary increase . ''
2007_01_01_1815803	3	His annual report noted that his predecessor , Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist , had spoken out on the issue of judicial pay for 20 years .
2007_01_01_1815803	4	Chief Justice Roberts himself mentioned it , among other topics , a year ago in his first report .
2007_01_01_1815803	5	He decided to make the subject his sole policy focus this time , he said , in the hope that '' people will take notice '' of a problem that '' has now reached the level of a constitutional crisis that threatens to undermine the strength and independence of the federal judiciary . ''
2007_01_01_1815803	6	Federal judges rarely left the bench in the past but are now leaving at an increasing rate , 38 in the past six years , including 17 in the last two years . ''
2007_01_01_1815803	7	Inadequate compensation directly threatens the viability of life tenure , '' the chief justice said .
2007_01_01_1815803	8	Further , he noted that judges were increasingly drawn from among lawyers already working in the public sector , often as state court judges or federal magistrate judges .
2007_01_01_1815803	9	Fewer than 40 percent of new federal district judges come from the private sector , Chief Justice Roberts said , adding , '' It changes the nature of the federal judiciary when judges are no longer drawn primarily from among the best lawyers in the practicing bar . ''
2007_01_01_1815803	10	By statute , federal district judges receive the same salaries as members of Congress , now $ 165,200 a year .
2007_01_01_1815803	11	Judges on the federal appeals courts receive $ 175,100 ; associate justices of the Supreme Court , $ 203,000 ; and the chief justice $ 212,100 .
2007_01_01_1815803	12	The linkage of district judges ' and Congressional salaries means that judges pay the price when members of Congress discern that it would be politically unpopular to raise their own pay .
2007_01_01_1815803	13	That is not the only problem , from the judges ' perspective .
2007_01_01_1815803	14	Their last substantial pay raise was a 25 percent increase provided by a 1989 law , the Ethics Reform Act , under which judges lost the right to earn most types of outside income in return for the raise and the promise of regular cost-of-living increases .
2007_01_01_1815803	15	But there were no increases in 5 of the last 13 years .
2007_01_01_1815803	16	Congress ended its 2006 session without providing a cost-of-living increase for the current fiscal year . ''
2007_01_01_1815803	17	Congressional inaction in the face of this situation is grievously unfair , '' the chief justice said .
2007_01_01_1815803	18	The outlook may be somewhat brighter for 2007 .
2007_01_01_1815803	19	Senator Patrick J. Leahy , the Vermont Democrat who will take over as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee , on Sunday praised the chief justice 's report and said he would '' do what I can to convince Congress to fairly evaluate this issue and the chief 's arguments . ''
2007_01_01_1815803	20	A cost-of-living increase '' should be an early item of business that the new Congress can accomplish , '' Mr. Leahy said .
2007_01_01_1815803	21	Mr. Leahy noted that a bill he sponsored four years ago to make up for the missed cost-of-living increases had passed the Senate but failed in the House of Representatives . ''
2007_01_01_1815803	22	I hope Congress and the president will reconsider such a measure this year and will do their duty when it comes to fair compensation for the independent judiciary , '' he said .
2007_01_01_1815803	23	As earnings have soared in recent years for lawyers at the top firms , federal judges have found it galling that their own law clerks outstrip them within a year or two of entering private practice .
2007_01_01_1815803	24	Including salary and year-end bonuses , first-year associates at leading New York City firms earned as much as $ 175,000 in 2006 .
2007_01_01_1815803	25	On top of that , firms offer a signing bonus of $ 200,000 to entice Supreme Court law clerks to join their ranks .
2007_01_01_1815803	26	Chief Justice Roberts , who earned slightly more than $ 1 million from his law firm in 2003 , his last full year in private practice , said judges did not expect to keep up with what they could earn in private life . ''
2007_01_01_1815803	27	We do not even talk about comparisons with the practicing bar anymore , '' he said .
2007_01_01_1815803	28	For the last several years , judges discussing the pay question have pointed to a different benchmark that they regard as a more realistic indicator of how far they have lagged : the difference between judges ' pay and the salaries in legal academia .
2007_01_01_1815803	29	Justice Stephen G. Breyer , a former law professor himself , testified in 2002 at a hearing of the National Commission on the Public Service , a private group headed by Paul A. Volcker , former chairman of the Federal Reserve .
2007_01_01_1815803	30	Justice Breyer presented charts showing that while in 1969 , federal district judges earned slightly more than law school deans , $ 40,000 compared to $ 33,000 , and substantially more than the $ 28,000 earned by senior law professors , the situation by 2002 was completely reversed .
2007_01_01_1815803	31	In that year , the judges were earning $ 150,000 , compared to $ 250,000 for the professors and $ 325,000 for the deans .
2007_01_01_1815806	0	N.B.A. GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS -- Assigned C Patrick O'Bryant to Bakersfield of the NBA Development League .
2007_01_01_1815806	1	N.H.L. LEAGUE -- Suspended Rangers F Colton Orr for five games and Washington F Donald Brashear for one game for their actions in a Dec. 30 game .
2007_01_01_1815806	2	COLLEGE TENNESSEE -- Announced men 's basketball freshman G Marques Johnson will transfer .
2007_01_01_1815807	0	AMERICAN FOOTBALL CONFERENCE SEEDING -- 1 TEAM -- San Diego Chargers ( West champions ) The Chargers have won 10 in a row , including the finale over Arizona to clinch home-field advantage throughout the A.F.C. playoffs .
2007_01_01_1815807	1	If the seedings hold up , their first game could be a doozy : against New England , whose coach , Bill Belichick , would surely try to confuse quarterback Philip Rivers in his first playoff game , and whose solid run defense would give LaDainian Tomlinson one of his biggest challenges of the season .
2007_01_01_1815807	2	RECORD -- 14-2 1ST-ROUND OPPONENT -- BYE SEEDING -- 2 TEAM -- Baltimore Ravens ( North champions ) Baltimore beat Buffalo yesterday , using its fifth interception return for a touchdown to secure the second seeding and a first-round bye .
2007_01_01_1815807	3	The Ravens have won four in a row and their offense has been energized since Brian Billick took over the play-calling .
2007_01_01_1815807	4	But a run in the playoffs will still be all about their top-rated defense .
2007_01_01_1815807	5	Baltimore held the Chargers to 13 points in October to hand San Diego its first loss .
2007_01_01_1815807	6	RECORD -- 13-3 1ST-ROUND OPPONENT -- BYE SEEDING -- 3 TEAM -- Indianapolis Colts ( South champions ) The Colts held off the Dolphins yesterday to secure the third seeding , but the Dolphins , playing a meaningless game , moved down the field with ease late in the fourth quarter , a bad omen for Indianapolis .
2007_01_01_1815807	7	The defense is not as good as it was last year , and the Colts will go only as far as their porous run defense - the worst in the league - allows them .
2007_01_01_1815807	8	The Chiefs have a star running back in Larry Johnson , and that could mean another early exit for the Colts .
2007_01_01_1815807	9	RECORD -- 12-4 1ST-ROUND OPPONENT -- Kansas City SEEDING -- 4 TEAM -- New England Patriots ( East champions ) After an erratic season , the Patriots go into the playoffs on a roll after pounding Vince Young ( five sacks , three turnovers ) and the Titans yesterday .
2007_01_01_1815807	10	They remain an intimidating playoff opponent because of Tom Brady , who has had a superb season despite a dearth of receiver talent .
2007_01_01_1815807	11	But the Jets held the Patriots to 14 points in Foxborough in November .
2007_01_01_1815807	12	RECORD -- 12-4 1ST-ROUND OPPONENT -- Jets SEEDING -- 5 TEAM -- Jets The Jets defeated the Raiders yesterday to secure a wild-card spot , completing a remarkable rookie regular season for Coach Eric Mangini , who took over a team that won only four games last season .
2007_01_01_1815807	13	The Jets started looking like a serious threat when they beat the Patriots in Foxborough in mid-November .
2007_01_01_1815807	14	Now they are going back for another visit , another chance for Bill Belichick to offer Mangini a warm welcome back .
2007_01_01_1815807	15	RECORD -- 10-6 1ST-ROUND OPPONENT -- New England SEEDING -- 6 TEAM -- Kansas City Chiefs The Chiefs snuck in when the Broncos lost to the 49ers in overtime yesterday and Pittsburgh beat Cincinnati .
2007_01_01_1815807	16	The Chiefs survived Trent Green 's severe concussion in the season opener because they leaned heavily on running back Larry Johnson .
2007_01_01_1815807	17	Coach Herman Edwards will no doubt do that again when he faces his friend Tony Dungy 's suspect run defense .
2007_01_01_1815807	18	RECORD -- 9-7 1ST-ROUND OPPONENT -- Indianapolis NATIONAL FOOTBALL CONFERENCE SEEDING -- 1 TEAM -- Chicago Bears ( North champions ) The Bears wrapped up the top seeding long ago on the strength of their dominating defense , rendering last night 's game against the Packers meaningless .
2007_01_01_1815807	19	But the Bears still have not answered the biggest question about a potential run to the Super Bowl : What happens if quarterback Rex Grossman struggles ?
2007_01_01_1815807	20	It is a question that could shape the postseason for the N.F.C. , especially if the Bears face the Saints , who have a top-five pass defense , in the conference championship game .
2007_01_01_1815807	21	RECORD -- 13-3 1ST-ROUND OPPONENT -- BYE SEEDING -- 2 TEAM -- New Orleans Saints ( South champions ) The Saints , the feel-good story of the season , may also be the most dangerous team in the N.F.C. , and after their decimation of the Giants in Week 15 , everyone knows it .
2007_01_01_1815807	22	Drew Brees , Reggie Bush and Deuce McAllister rested for most of the Saints ' meaningless loss to the Panthers yesterday .
2007_01_01_1815807	23	Bush versus Chicago linebacker Brian Urlacher in the conference championship would be a blockbuster .
2007_01_01_1815807	24	RECORD -- 10-6 1ST-ROUND OPPONENT -- BYE SEEDING -- 3 TEAM -- Philadelphia Eagles ( East champions ) The Eagles finished the season with five consecutive victories behind the backup quarterback Jeff Garcia , who has been so effective leading a balanced offense that Donovan McNabb 's mother is worried about her injured son 's future .
2007_01_01_1815807	25	The Eagles defeated the Giants , 36-22 , just two weeks ago , and they seem to be getting stronger and more confident by the week .
2007_01_01_1815807	26	Their offense , improbably , is in the top five in the league .
2007_01_01_1815807	27	RECORD -- 10-6 1ST-ROUND OPPONENT -- Giants SEEDING -- 4 TEAM -- Seattle Seahawks ( West champions ) The Seahawks blew out the Buccaneers in their season finale , but they had lost three in a row before that .
2007_01_01_1815807	28	They are nowhere near the powerhouse team that went to the Super Bowl last season .
2007_01_01_1815807	29	And the final game was costly : Cornerback Kelly Herndon broke his left ankle ( another cornerback , Marcus Trufant , did n't play because of a sprained ankle ) and linebacker Leroy Hill sustained a concussion .
2007_01_01_1815807	30	RECORD -- 9-7 1ST-ROUND OPPONENT -- Dallas SEEDING -- 5 TEAM -- Dallas Cowboys Less than a month ago , the Cowboys had a two-game lead in the N.F.C. East and looked like the best team in the conference .
2007_01_01_1815807	31	But yesterday , with a chance to win the division , they lost to the Lions at home , their third loss in their final four games .
2007_01_01_1815807	32	Quarterback Tony Romo was voted into the Pro Bowl , but he has struggled in those three losses .
2007_01_01_1815807	33	Seattle 's Qwest Field is one of the loudest , most difficult stadiums in the league .
2007_01_01_1815807	34	Seattle 's secondary is injury-riddled , so the complaining Dallas receivers should get plenty of action .
2007_01_01_1815807	35	RECORD -- 9-7 1ST-ROUND OPPONENT -- Seattle SEEDING -- 6 TEAM -- Giants The Giants survived a near-complete collapse and rediscovered their offense to sneak into the playoffs with almost no momentum .
2007_01_01_1815807	36	They played the Eagles close for a while two weeks ago , but their defense was gashed up the middle by the Eagles ' rushers .
2007_01_01_1815807	37	Earlier in the season , the Giants forged an epic comeback to beat the Eagles in Philadelphia .
2007_01_01_1815807	38	But that was a long time ago , and if they beat the Eagles next week , it will be an even greater comeback for the season .
2007_01_01_1815807	39	RECORD -- 8-8 1ST-ROUND OPPONENT -- Philadelphia PRO FOOTBALL
2007_01_01_1815808	0	Amid the shouting lately about whether global warming is a human-caused catastrophe or a hoax , some usually staid climate scientists in the usually invisible middle are speaking up .
2007_01_01_1815808	1	The discourse over the issue has been feverish since Hurricane Katrina .
2007_01_01_1815808	2	Seizing the moment , many environmental campaigners , former Vice President Al Gore and some scientists have portrayed the growing human influence on the climate as an unfolding disaster that is already measurably strengthening hurricanes , spreading diseases and amplifying recent droughts and deluges .
2007_01_01_1815808	3	Conservative politicians and a few scientists , many with ties to energy companies , have variously countered that human-driven warming is inconsequential , unproved or a manufactured crisis .
2007_01_01_1815808	4	A third stance is now emerging , espoused by many experts who challenge both poles of the debate .
2007_01_01_1815808	5	They agree that accumulating carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping smokestack and tailpipe gases probably pose a momentous environmental challenge , but say the appropriate response is more akin to buying fire insurance and installing sprinklers and new wiring in an old , irreplaceable house ( the home planet ) than to fighting a fire already raging . ''
2007_01_01_1815808	6	Climate change presents a very real risk , '' said Carl Wunsch , a climate and oceans expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . ''
2007_01_01_1815808	7	It seems worth a very large premium to insure ourselves against the most catastrophic scenarios .
2007_01_01_1815808	8	Denying the risk seems utterly stupid .
2007_01_01_1815808	9	Claiming we can calculate the probabilities with any degree of skill seems equally stupid . ''
2007_01_01_1815808	10	Many in this camp seek a policy of reducing vulnerability to all climate extremes while building public support for a sustained shift to nonpolluting energy sources .
2007_01_01_1815808	11	They have made their voices heard in Web logs , news media interviews and at least one statement from a large scientific group , the World Meteorological Organization .
2007_01_01_1815808	12	In early December , that group posted a statement written by a committee consisting of most of the climatologists assessing whether warming seas have affected hurricanes .
2007_01_01_1815808	13	While each degree of warming of tropical oceans is likely to intensify such storms a percentage point or two in the future , they said , there is no firm evidence of a heat-triggered strengthening in storms in recent years .
2007_01_01_1815808	14	The experts added that the recent increase in the impact of storms was because of more people getting in harm 's way , not stronger storms .
2007_01_01_1815808	15	There are enough experts holding such views that Roger A. Pielke Jr. , a political scientist and blogger at the University of Colorado , Boulder , came up with a name for them ( and himself ) : '' nonskeptical heretics . '' ''
2007_01_01_1815808	16	A lot of people have independently come to the same sort of conclusion , '' Dr. Pielke said . ''
2007_01_01_1815808	17	We do have a problem , we do need to act , but what actions are practical and pragmatic ? ''
2007_01_01_1815808	18	This approach was most publicly laid out in an opinion article on the BBC Web site in November by Mike Hulme , the director of the Tyndall Center for Climate Change Research in Britain .
2007_01_01_1815808	19	Dr. Hulme said that shrill voices crying doom could paralyze instead of inspire . ''
2007_01_01_1815808	20	I have found myself increasingly chastised by climate change campaigners when my public statements and lectures on climate change have not satisfied their thirst for environmental drama , '' he wrote . ''
2007_01_01_1815808	21	I believe climate change is real , must be faced and action taken .
2007_01_01_1815808	22	But the discourse of catastrophe is in danger of tipping society onto a negative , depressive and reactionary trajectory . ''
2007_01_01_1815808	23	Other experts say there is no time for nuance , given the general lack of public response to the threat posed particularly by carbon dioxide , a byproduct of burning fossil fuels and forests that persists for a century or more in the air and is accumulating rapidly in the atmosphere and changing the pH of the oceans .
2007_01_01_1815808	24	James E. Hansen , the veteran climate scientist with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration who has spoken out about climate dangers since 1988 , has recently said that scientists have been too quiet too long . ''
2007_01_01_1815808	25	If we want to avoid producing a different planet , we need to start acting now , '' and not with paltry steps , he said in a recent e-mail exchange with a reporter and other scientists . ''
2007_01_01_1815808	26	It seems almost to be a secret that we can not put all of the fossil-fuel CO2 into the air without producing a different planet , and yes , dangerous change .
2007_01_01_1815808	27	There are people who do n't know that ! ''
2007_01_01_1815808	28	Debate among scientists over how to describe the climate threat is particularly intense right now as experts work on the final language in portions of the latest assessment of global warming by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change .
2007_01_01_1815808	29	In three previous reports , the last published in 2001 , this global network of scientists operating under the auspices of the United Nations has presented an ever-firmer picture of a growing human role in warming .
2007_01_01_1815808	30	Studies used to generate the next report ( portions are to be issued in February ) have shown a likely warming in the 21st century -- unless emissions of greenhouse gases abate -- at least several times that of the last century 's one-degree rise .
2007_01_01_1815808	31	But substantial uncertainty still clouds projections of important impacts , like how high and quickly seas would rise as ice sheets thawed .
2007_01_01_1815808	32	Recent drafts of the climate report used a conservative analysis that does not project a rise most people would equate with catastrophe , scientists involved in writing it say .
2007_01_01_1815808	33	Other experts say this may send too comforting a message .
2007_01_01_1815808	34	Dr. Hulme insists that it is best not to gloss over uncertainties .
2007_01_01_1815808	35	In fact , he and other experts say that uncertainty is one reason to act -- as a hedge against the prospect that problems could be much worse than projected .
2007_01_01_1815808	36	His goal , Dr. Hulme said , is to raise public appreciation of the unprecedented scale and nature of the challenge . ''
2007_01_01_1815808	37	Climate change is not a problem waiting for a solution ( least of all a solution delivered and packaged by science ) , but a powerful idea that will transform the way we develop , '' he said in an e-mail message .
2007_01_01_1815808	38	Dr. Hulme and others avoid sounding alarmist , but offer scant comfort to anyone who doubts that humans are contributing to warming or believes the matter can be deferred .
2007_01_01_1815808	39	These experts see a clear need for the public to engage now , but not to panic .
2007_01_01_1815808	40	They worry that portrayals of the issue like that in '' An Inconvenient Truth , '' the documentary focused on the views of Mr. Gore , may push too hard .
2007_01_01_1815808	41	Many in this group also see a need to portray clearly that the response would require far more than switching to fluorescent light bulbs and to hybrid cars . ''
2007_01_01_1815808	42	This is a mega-ethical challenge , '' said Jerry D. Mahlman , a climatologist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder , Colo. , who has studied global warming for more than three decades . ''
2007_01_01_1815808	43	In space , it 's the size of a planet , and in time , it has scales far broader than what we go-go Homo sapiens are accustomed to dealing with . ''
2007_01_01_1815808	44	Dr. Mahlman and others say that the buildup of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases can not be quickly reversed with existing technologies .
2007_01_01_1815808	45	And even if every engine on earth were shut down today , they add , there would be no measurable impact on the warming rate for many years , given the buildup of heat already banked in the seas .
2007_01_01_1815808	46	Because of the scale and time lag , a better strategy , Dr. Mahlman and others say , is to treat human-caused warming more as a risk to be reduced than a problem to be solved .
2007_01_01_1815808	47	These experts also say efforts to attribute recent weather extremes to the climate trend , though they may generate headlines in the short run , distract from the real reasons to act , which relate more to the long-term relationship of people and the planet . ''

2007_01_01_1815808	49	I portray it as part of a broader problem of environmental stewardship -- preserving a livable planet with abundant resources for future generations . ''
2007_01_01_1815808	50	Some experts , though , argue that moderation in a message is likely to be misread as satisfaction with the pace of change .
2007_01_01_1815808	51	John P. Holdren , an energy and environment expert at Harvard and president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science , defended the more strident calls for limits on carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases . ''
2007_01_01_1815808	52	I am one of those who believes that any reasonably comprehensive and up-to-date look at the evidence makes clear that civilization has already generated dangerous anthropogenic interference in the climate system , '' Dr. Holdren said . ''

2007_01_01_1815809	1	They designed it as a split-level terrace overlooking the park 's lake , with an underground arcade whose ceiling was composed of almost 16,000 tiles .
2007_01_01_1815809	2	Over the decades , the 50-ton ceiling weakened and its tiles deteriorated .
2007_01_01_1815809	3	The tiles have been in storage since being removed in the 1980s during an initial repair effort .
2007_01_01_1815809	4	The Central Park Conservancy renewed its plan for a $ 7 million restoration after getting a $ 3.5 million gift from the estate of Evelyn West in 2002 .
2007_01_01_1815809	5	The arcade , originally completed in the 1860s , is expected to reopen in late January .

2007_01_01_1815809	7	REPLACING DAMAGE About 10 percent of the tiles were beyond repair .
2007_01_01_1815809	8	New ones were made in Stokeon-Trent , England , for $ 250 to $ 270 each .
2007_01_01_1815809	9	REINSTALLING TILE PANELS The 49 panels alternate between two patterns .
2007_01_01_1815809	10	Three panels , consisting only of brand new tiles , will be placed in one of the two side loggias .

2007_01_01_1815809	14	Not much is known about the framework 's historic colors other than that they were '' richly gilded . ''
2007_01_01_1815809	15	TILE PANELS Tiles on each panel are fused with mortar , then screwed into a metal frame so they can be installed into the cast iron ribs as a single unit .
2007_01_01_1815809	16	Each panel has 324 encaustic , or inlaid , tiles .
2007_01_01_1815809	17	They were made using small pieces of colored clay laid into a mold and baked together so that the colors are embedded , not just a surface glaze .

2007_01_01_1815810	0	Thousands of mourners filed past the coffin of former President Gerald R. Ford on Sunday as he lay in state below the Capitol dome , many saying they came to pay overdue respect to an overshadowed leader . ''
2007_01_01_1815810	1	We owe him a debt of gratitude , and we never really expressed it , '' said Tim Fain , a consultant for I.B.M. who lives a few blocks away from the Capitol . ''
2007_01_01_1815810	2	He did n't ask to be president , '' Mr. Fain said . ''
2007_01_01_1815810	3	He did n't have an agenda .
2007_01_01_1815810	4	He was a good man , an honorable man , who was asked to do a horrible job , through no fault of his own , and came through and brought the country back together . ''
2007_01_01_1815810	5	Mr. Ford 's memorial did not bring out the kind of crowds or emotions that President Ronald Reagan 's did two years ago , when the round-the-clock viewing attracted tens of thousands who waited in line for five hours or more .
2007_01_01_1815810	6	The wait to see Mr. Ford 's coffin was seldom longer than an hour .
2007_01_01_1815810	7	Indeed , many in the crowd said they came as much to honor the office of president as the man who had occupied it for two and a half tumultuous years in the 1970s .
2007_01_01_1815810	8	More people talked about Watergate , Vietnam and inflation than about Mr. Ford 's words or deeds .
2007_01_01_1815810	9	Mourners gawked at the Capitol 's art and architecture as guards guided them in and out .
2007_01_01_1815810	10	Almost everyone interviewed said they happened to be in town or lived nearby . ''
2007_01_01_1815810	11	Not a lot of presidents are going to be dying in the near future , '' said Frank Lopes , an advertising executive from Asbury , N.J. '' It is an opportunity to see how the respect is paid . ''
2007_01_01_1815810	12	Marissa Hyde brought her young daughter from the Virginia suburbs because , Ms. Hyde said , '' This is a history-making event , and it is not every day that we live in the nation 's capital and can see something like this . ''
2007_01_01_1815810	13	Filing out of the rotunda , where Mr. Ford 's coffin lay on the bier once used for Lincoln and under the painting of '' The Apotheosis of Washington '' in the eye of the dome , some said they were surprised by a wave of feelings for Mr. Ford .
2007_01_01_1815810	14	Ms. Hyde , for one , left choking back tears .
2007_01_01_1815810	15	R. J. Konkoleski , a hospice worker from Adena , Ohio , who was born in 1977 , the year Mr. Ford left office , said , '' It was a lot more moving than I even anticipated . ''
2007_01_01_1815810	16	Mr. Konkoleski said he happened to be visiting friends on the Eastern Shore of Maryland and came to the Capitol out of a sense of patriotic duty .
2007_01_01_1815810	17	But he left marveling at the chain of circumstances that elevated Mr. Ford to lead the most powerful nation in the world , saying , '' Would he have made it if all the ` ifs ' were n't there ? ''
2007_01_01_1815810	18	Joanne Richcreek , who said she had arrived from Fairfax , Va. , before 7 a.m. , said she came partly because of a first-hand experience with Mr. Ford .
2007_01_01_1815810	19	While she was still working for the government , Ms. Richcreek said , she once had to call the Michigan office that he maintained after leaving the presidency , expecting to talk to a secretary . ''
2007_01_01_1815810	20	A guy got on the phone and said , ` This is Jerry .
2007_01_01_1815810	21	Who is this ? ' ''
2007_01_01_1815810	22	He was very friendly , so there was this personal connection . ''
2007_01_01_1815810	23	Two of the former president 's sons , Jack and Steve , spent time Sunday afternoon shaking hands with visitors before they filed past the coffin , thanking each one on behalf of the family .
2007_01_01_1815810	24	Former Senator Bob Dole , Mr. Ford 's running mate in 1976 , came to pay his respects and appeared surprised to see Jack Ford .
2007_01_01_1815810	25	Although few said they had traveled long distances to be there , Charles Pruett , an administrator at Georgetown University , postponed a trip to Los Angeles for New Year 's Eve . ''
2007_01_01_1815810	26	He was a very good and decent man who was called at the right time to serve the country when we needed it most , '' Mr. Pruett said . ''
2007_01_01_1815810	27	We were very fortunate , and I felt that if I could do anything to at least show a little respect I was going to do so . ''
2007_01_01_1815811	0	This college town received what it wanted when , during the 1980s and 90s , it sought to reverse the decline of its downtown and to create a more vibrant civic center that would draw people at night and on weekends .
2007_01_01_1815811	1	Since then , thousands of young professionals , retirees and former suburbanites have moved to glistening condominium buildings in the shadow of the state Capitol 's dome and only a few blocks from the University of Wisconsin 's main campus .
2007_01_01_1815811	2	And there is hardly a bad night for business near State Street , where university students and tourists pack restaurants and bars to capacity even on freezing weeknights .
2007_01_01_1815811	3	But as downtown 's population and revelry have grown , so have overcrowding on the streets , vandalism and , most significantly , the police say , alcohol-related crime .
2007_01_01_1815811	4	Mayor Dave Cieslewicz and other officials find themselves grappling with a problem that is a direct result of Madison 's successful transformation : how to tone down downtown .
2007_01_01_1815811	5	As an urban issue , the downsizing of downtowns has little precedent because many cities , particularly in the Midwest , are struggling mightily to bring people back to their cores , not send them away .
2007_01_01_1815811	6	Of course , many college towns deal with problems related to drinking .
2007_01_01_1815811	7	In the Midwest alone , La Crosse , Wis. , and East Lansing and Ann Arbor , Mich. , are struggling with how to cope with the public mayhem often fueled by inebriated students .
2007_01_01_1815811	8	In Madison , two Common Council members , convinced that much of what ails downtown can be traced to the proliferation of bars and restaurants known more for drinking than dining , introduced a plan intended to reduce the number of such establishments , and to restrict the approval of new liquor licenses .
2007_01_01_1815811	9	The plan , which has the support of Mayor Cieslewicz ( pronounced chess-LEV-ich ) , is preliminary and does not detail , for example , how many or which places may be closed .
2007_01_01_1815811	10	A final plan is expected to be ready for a Council vote in the spring .
2007_01_01_1815811	11	That area of nearly one square mile -- between Lake Mendota , Lake Monona and Blair and Lake Streets -- has 120 places that serve only or mostly alcohol .
2007_01_01_1815811	12	They have a capacity of more than 11,000 people , city officials said .
2007_01_01_1815811	13	The proposal has its critics , many of whom call it nothing less than modern-day Prohibition , and an assault on personal freedom and the free market that flies in the face of Madison 's traditional liberalism and Wisconsin 's entrenched drinking culture .
2007_01_01_1815811	14	Some Council members say they worry that limiting the number of bars will only increase the number of drinkers who turn to house parties and makeshift taverns , where binge drinking and bad behavior often go together but behind closed doors . ''
2007_01_01_1815811	15	A lot of the activists on this issue revile alcohol , and their logic is equally fallacious as the original Prohibitionists ' , '' said Austin King , the president of the Common Council and a member of its Progressive caucus . ''
2007_01_01_1815811	16	From a safety perspective , '' Mr. King said , '' I would much , much rather have young people drinking in the regulated environment of bars . ''
2007_01_01_1815811	17	College students , not surprisingly , also oppose the plan . ''
2007_01_01_1815811	18	A proportion of students drink irresponsibly , but the majority do n't , '' said Katrina Schleitwiler , 21 , a political science major at the University of Wisconsin . ''
2007_01_01_1815811	19	This would just drive students into other places to drink and not affect the problem at all . ''
2007_01_01_1815811	20	Although Ms. Schleitwiler acknowledged a spate of crimes around campus and downtown , she said she did not think alcohol abuse by students or anyone else was at its root . ''
2007_01_01_1815811	21	Madison is becoming a big city with more crime , '' she said . ''
2007_01_01_1815811	22	How different is that from any other city ? ''
2007_01_01_1815811	23	The police see things differently .
2007_01_01_1815811	24	According to a recent police department analysis of attacks in which someone was injured downtown , about 75 percent of the victims and perpetrators were intoxicated .
2007_01_01_1815811	25	The analysis also found that after midnight on Thursdays , Fridays and Saturdays , police officers , paramedics and firefighters often spent half to all of their working hours responding to alcohol-fueled fights and disorderly conduct .
2007_01_01_1815811	26	Noise , public urination and vandalism are constant concerns .
2007_01_01_1815811	27	The University of Wisconsin has tried many initiatives to curtail under-age drinking and older students ' overconsumption .
2007_01_01_1815811	28	Most recently , the city and the college jointly paid for a municipal alcohol policy coordinator -- referred to as the '' bar czar '' -- to redouble those efforts . ''
2007_01_01_1815811	29	Frankly , nothing has worked very well , and there 's still a culture of binge drinking , '' Mayor Cieslewicz said .
2007_01_01_1815811	30	For the last five years , Madison , formerly a sleepy college town , has grown by about 2,500 people a year into a medium-size city with a population of about 230,000 .
2007_01_01_1815811	31	In the last decade , 1,950 apartments -- rental and condominium units -- have been built downtown .
2007_01_01_1815811	32	But the arrival of so many newcomers has produced a culture clash .
2007_01_01_1815811	33	Stefanie Moritz , a retired librarian , moved with her husband from Phoenix into a downtown condominium about three years ago , drawn by pedestrian-friendly streets , a university job for her husband and the community 's progressive politics . ''
2007_01_01_1815811	34	We decided that we definitely wanted to live downtown , so we could get rid of one of our cars , my husband could walk to work and we could enjoy the downtown experience , '' Ms. Moritz said . ''
2007_01_01_1815811	35	The reality is a little bit different . ''
2007_01_01_1815811	36	She said she quickly grew irritated at being awakened at 2:30 a.m. , when the noisy bar crowd usually begins to make its way home , dropping empty beer cans and other trash along the way .
2007_01_01_1815811	37	One morning she woke to find that garbage had been torched and the flames had charred a tree . ''
2007_01_01_1815811	38	I want to live downtown , but I also want a decent quality of life , '' Ms. Moritz said . ''
2007_01_01_1815811	39	And I feel that that is being denied by the present level of alcohol use . ''
2007_01_01_1815811	40	About 18 months ago , Ms. Moritz became active in a relatively new residents ' group , Capitol Neighborhoods , which is at the forefront of the push for stricter drinking rules .
2007_01_01_1815811	41	Hawk Schenkel , the owner of one of the biggest restaurants on State Street , Hawk 's Bar and Grill , pointed out that residents who criticized the downtown scene had '' moved downtown in a university town . '' ''
2007_01_01_1815811	42	Do they know where all the revenue comes from downtown , why we have a downtown that 's alive and worth being in ? ''
2007_01_01_1815811	43	Mr. Schenkel asked . ''
2007_01_01_1815811	44	All that could change . '' ''
2007_01_01_1815811	45	If the ordinance as written were to pass , my bar would automatically be worth at least $ 100,000 more , overnight , and it 's clear that I personally stand to gain financially , '' he said . ''
2007_01_01_1815811	46	But I 'm against this on principle , and I do n't think it helps the problem .
2007_01_01_1815811	47	My argument is that there are n't enough bars .
2007_01_01_1815811	48	It 's the overcrowding that leads to violence . ''

2007_01_01_1815814	1	Was the trial fair ?
2007_01_01_1815814	2	The statements of President Bush on the subject are hardly reassuring , as they come from a man who supports detention without due process and who considers torture a legitimate interrogation method .
2007_01_01_1815814	3	What will the repercussions of this execution worldwide be ?
2007_01_01_1815814	4	Will it encourage the most brutal dictators of the world to hang on to their power by all means to avoid certain execution once they are deposed ?
2007_01_01_1815814	5	More generally , does revenge through the death penalty bring closure , or does it elicit more revenge and more violence , initiating a spiral of hatred that no human force may be able to stop ?
2007_01_01_1815814	6	I am afraid that the execution of Saddam Hussein had nothing to do with justice and was carried out only to satisfy the hatred he inspired in most of us .
2007_01_01_1815814	7	This is a lame excuse to take any life , including Saddam Hussein 's .
2007_01_01_1815814	8	Lodovico Balducci Tampa , Fla. , Dec. 30 , 2006 To the Editor : Justice in a show trial conducted by conquerors is a joke .
2007_01_01_1815814	9	And even assuming that Saddam Hussein was guilty of the crimes laid at his door , the cost of putting him to death is unacceptably high , since it adds to our sorry image in the Middle East as violent , self-serving intruders .

Holbrow Cambridge , Mass. , Dec. 30 , 2006 To the Editor : Re '' Saddam Hussein , Defiant Dictator Who Ruled Iraq With Violence and Fear '' ( obituary , Dec. 30 ) : You write , '' The despot , known as Saddam , had oppressed Iraq for more than 30 years , unleashing devastating regional wars and reducing his once promising , oil-rich nation to a claustrophobic police state . ''
2007_01_01_1815814	11	This simple statement illustrates why the invasion of Iraq and the complete elimination of Saddam Hussein and his regime was necessary , regardless of the Bush administration 's '' true '' motivation for the invasion or its incompetence in controlling the situation and in providing aid and security to the people of Iraq .
2007_01_01_1815814	12	No self-respecting humanitarian should raise his head if he opposed the war knowing what Saddam Hussein was responsible for .
2007_01_01_1815814	13	And what he would surely be doing today if still in power regardless of all the sanctions , diplomacy and United Nations debates .

2007_01_01_1815814	17	Surely this is important for us to acknowledge , even study .
2007_01_01_1815814	18	Alan Meyers Cambridge , Mass. , Dec. 30 , 2006 To the Editor : It was interesting to read your '' terrible swiftness '' description of Saddam Hussein 's hanging death ( front page , Dec. 30 ) .

2007_01_01_1815814	26	This tally , when added to the staggering Iraqi death toll from collateral damage and sectarian violence , might provoke a reasonable person to ask whether there is a price that is too high to pay for planting a seed of democracy in a very resistant soil .

2007_01_01_1815814	29	This execution by hanging reminiscent of the Middle Ages is not helping them consider other kinds of punishment .
2007_01_01_1815814	30	What do we say to young people : '' Saddam Hussein killed a lot of people in his country so we 're punishing him by hanging '' ?
2007_01_01_1815814	31	Do n't we stoop to the level of the criminals when we want retribution ?
2007_01_01_1815814	32	Life is God 's creation ; so with death .
2007_01_01_1815814	33	It 's not for men to do .
2007_01_01_1815814	34	Priscilla V. Dizon Seattle , Dec. 30 , 2006 To the Editor : The hanging of Saddam Hussein is a watershed in modern Arab history and Arab-American relations .
2007_01_01_1815814	35	Two things about it will be remembered by all : It would have been impossible without the American invasion , conquest and occupation of Iraq ; and it was achieved by and through the following chain of events : Saddam Hussein 's being captured and held by American occupation forces ; being tried by a court of controversial , if not dubious , legitimacy appointed and approved by the American authorities ; and being executed by American encouragement , prodding and certain approval .
2007_01_01_1815814	36	The act and the events that eventually led to the execution were undertaken and met with the approval of the majority of Arab officialdom and the rejection and disapproval of the majority of Arab public and popular opinion .
2007_01_01_1815814	37	Another landmark event in Arab-American relations .

2007_01_01_1815815	0	Some of the links by bloggers to entries in Wikipedia , an online encyclopedia , were sparked by news events , like the death of Steve Irwin and the ethics scandal involving former Representative Mark Foley , Republican of Florida , shown above in 2003 .
2007_01_01_1815815	1	Others , from a blogosphere of about 38 million blogs tracked by Nielsen BuzzMetrics , are for Web-related topics like Wiki , which refers to sites where visitors can edit content , and Web 2.0 , second-generation Internet phenomena like social-networking sites .
2007_01_01_1815816	0	Only 24 hours earlier , it seemed that Giants Coach Tom Coughlin could be fired by the time dawn broke on a new year .
2007_01_01_1815816	1	But on Sunday , as the early results from the day 's N.F.L. schedule were confirming the Giants ' place in the playoffs , Coughlin was on the telephone , cheerfully talking like the leader of a team reborn .
2007_01_01_1815816	2	The Giants beat the Washington Redskins , 34-28 , on Saturday night .
2007_01_01_1815816	3	It was their second victory in the season 's final eight games , and it proved just enough for them to slip into the postseason as a wild-card team . ''
2007_01_01_1815816	4	We 're all excited about having this opportunity , '' Coughlin said during a conference call . ''
2007_01_01_1815816	5	And we 've certainly got to have great energy and great focus and prepare to play a team that 's really a hot team . ''
2007_01_01_1815816	6	That team , Coughlin had just learned , is the rival Philadelphia Eagles , who won their final five games to finish 10-6 , atop the National Football Conference East .
2007_01_01_1815816	7	The Giants -- 8-8 in the regular-season standings , 0-0 in their minds -- will face the Eagles in Philadelphia on Sunday at 4:30 p.m. .
2007_01_01_1815816	8	The Giants beat the Eagles there in the second game of the season , erasing a 24-7 fourth-quarter deficit for a 30-24 victory in overtime .
2007_01_01_1815816	9	The Eagles won the Dec. 17 rematch at Giants Stadium , 36-22 , by scoring two touchdowns in 10 seconds -- a scoring pass followed by an interception return in the fourth quarter .
2007_01_01_1815816	10	If the Giants are to realize the Super Bowl hopes they held so firmly at the beginning of the season , and that felt completely implausible before the weekend , they will have to win three games on the road -- first in Philadelphia , then in Chicago , then in New Orleans , Seattle or Dallas .
2007_01_01_1815816	11	It is not wholly unreasonable .
2007_01_01_1815816	12	The Giants were 5-3 on the road this season , 3-5 at home .
2007_01_01_1815816	13	And last year , the Pittsburgh Steelers became the first N.F.L. team to win three playoff games on the road on their way to a Super Bowl championship . ''
2007_01_01_1815816	14	I 'm always looking for examples that can be called upon that make specific points , and certainly that 's a very good one , '' Coughlin said .
2007_01_01_1815816	15	The Carolina Panthers were seeded sixth in the N.F.C. last season and beat the Giants and Bears on the road before falling in Seattle in the conference championship .
2007_01_01_1815816	16	A swirling mystery surrounding the Giants is how many more victories , if any , are required to guarantee Coughlin 's return for the final season of his four-year contract .
2007_01_01_1815816	17	The Giants ' owners have made no public comments about his job security .
2007_01_01_1815816	18	But the Giants have made the playoffs in consecutive seasons for the first time since 1989 and 1990 , a strong argument for Coughlin 's return .
2007_01_01_1815816	19	The coach would not say whether he has received any assurances or warnings from his employers . ''
2007_01_01_1815816	20	I 'm not talking about anything that has to do with that , '' Coughlin said Sunday . ''
2007_01_01_1815816	21	I 've not even thought one thought about that .
2007_01_01_1815816	22	I 've only been focused on trying to find a way for us to win , and that 's the way I will continue to focus . ''
2007_01_01_1815816	23	Winning only one playoff game will probably require a better performance than the one that the Giants mustered against the beleaguered Redskins , who ended the season with a 5-11 record .
2007_01_01_1815816	24	If the Giants are to wind their way through the N.F.C. bracket , they will have to get steadier play from quarterback Eli Manning and a stouter effort from their low-ranked and inconsistent defense .
2007_01_01_1815816	25	Manning was 12 of 26 for 101 yards against the Redskins , and his longest completion was 14 yards .
2007_01_01_1815816	26	Coughlin was complimentary of Manning 's game management -- changing pass plays to runs and vice versa , recognizing blitzes and not throwing any interceptions .
2007_01_01_1815816	27	But he acknowledged his concern over the number of incomplete passes , a constant issue for Manning , who is in his third season . ''
2007_01_01_1815816	28	Certainly we 'd like to have a higher percentage , '' Coughlin said .
2007_01_01_1815816	29	The Giants beat the Redskins largely on a few bursts by running back Tiki Barber .
2007_01_01_1815816	30	In the final regular-season game of his career , the retiring Barber saved his best for last -- a career-high , franchise-record 234 yards rushing , with touchdown runs of 15 , 55 and 50 yards .
2007_01_01_1815816	31	That probably will be the strategy of the play caller , Kevin Gilbride , against the Eagles -- piling as much of the load on Barber as possible and as little on Manning as is reasonable .
2007_01_01_1815816	32	The Giants will also spend the week searching for Band-Aids for a struggling defense .
2007_01_01_1815816	33	Handed a 27-7 third-quarter lead , the Giants allowed three long touchdown drives -- each lasting at least eight plays and going 69 , 66 and 68 yards .
2007_01_01_1815816	34	An inconsistent quarterback and a softening defense were key factors in the Giants ' fall through the standings in November and December , when a two-game lead in the division became a by-the-fingernails entry into the playoffs .
2007_01_01_1815816	35	It certainly beats the alternative .
2007_01_01_1815816	36	At kickoff of the Redskins game , it took an optimist wearing glasses tinted in Giants blue to envision a championship run .
2007_01_01_1815816	37	A few hours later , the team had its record set back to 0-0 , same as every other contender .
2007_01_01_1815816	38	A new year has dawned .
2007_01_01_1815816	39	EXTRA POINTS The offensive coordinator John Hufnagel , stripped of his duties last week and assigned a minor administrative role , has left the team . ''
2007_01_01_1815816	40	We worked together last week , and then John felt it was best for him to move on , '' Tom Coughlin said .
2007_01_01_1815816	41	Kevin Gilbride , the quarterbacks coach , took over Hufnagel 's responsibilities .
2007_01_01_1815816	42	Coughlin said he was not sure if tight end Jeremy Shockey , who missed Saturday 's game with a sprained ankle , would play against the Eagles .
2007_01_01_1815816	43	Roy E. Posner , a financial advisor for the Giants and a former chief financial officer of the Loews Corp. , died after a heart attack about 90 minutes after the game .
2007_01_01_1815817	0	The plan to turn Bryant Gumbel into a play-by-play announcer for the NFL Network was always a risky wager that at age 58 , he could adapt his broadcasting skills from the studio to the booth without prior experience .
2007_01_01_1815817	1	By the evidence of his eighth and final game of the season , the Giants ' 34-28 victory over the Redskins on Saturday night , Gumbel has shown how difficult mastering play-by-play is .
2007_01_01_1815817	2	Or he has made it seem tougher than it is .
2007_01_01_1815817	3	Gumbel 's hiring was a surprise , but he is a big name and all the best play-by-play voices were under contract .
2007_01_01_1815817	4	Choosing Cris Collinsworth as the analyst was an easy choice ; he is fearless , blunt , amusing and self-deprecating and has worked well with various partners .
2007_01_01_1815817	5	Experience helps , and he has had to dominate the games to buttress Gumbel 's weaknesses .
2007_01_01_1815817	6	I thought Gumbel would be better than he has been .
2007_01_01_1815817	7	Maybe it was the faith that he would be able to adapt more adroitly than he has .
2007_01_01_1815817	8	You can harp on the thinness of his voice , but that 's a minor element of his struggles .
2007_01_01_1815817	9	He is far from mastering the job 's mechanics , although he 's a little better than he was a few weeks ago .
2007_01_01_1815817	10	But he still does n't identify players , see penalty flags or describe action with requisite speed and detail .
2007_01_01_1815817	11	He does not seem to see what is happening as well as veteran announcers do , which can be attributed to inexperience or aging eyes .
2007_01_01_1815817	12	In his call of a clearly incomplete pass in the first quarter , he gave us a call that sounded like a completion . ''
2007_01_01_1815817	13	Manning with time , '' he said . ''
2007_01_01_1815817	14	Close to the marker .
2007_01_01_1815817	15	Collinsworth , too polite to correct the miscall , simply paused before he criticized Carter for the dropped ball .
2007_01_01_1815817	16	In the third quarter , on a pass that seemed to have been scooped by Carter , Gumbel said : '' Manning throws , this time to Tim Carter . ''
2007_01_01_1815817	17	Was it incomplete or not ?
2007_01_01_1815817	18	Gumbel did n't say .
2007_01_01_1815817	19	In separate but identical circumstances , Gumbel showed a startling lack of knowledge about elementary football .
2007_01_01_1815817	20	Late in the third quarter , Eli Manning completed a 10-yard pass to David Tyree , but it was not enough for a Giants first down on third-and-17 .
2007_01_01_1815817	21	Gumbel said : '' Complete to David Tyree , but he 's going to be short of the first-down marker and the Giants are going to give it up on downs . ''
2007_01_01_1815817	22	Out came Jeff Feagles , who punted the ball 42 yards on fourth down .
2007_01_01_1815817	23	Gumbel did not correct himself .
2007_01_01_1815817	24	It is football 101 that when one team surrenders the ball on downs , after an unsuccessful fourth-down play , the other starts at the yard line where the previous series ended .
2007_01_01_1815817	25	But with 2 minutes 26 seconds left in the fourth quarter , Gumbel displayed the hole in his knowledge again when Tiki Barber ran for 7 yards on third-and-10 .
2007_01_01_1815817	26	Gumbel said : '' He 's going to be short of a first down and the Redskins will take over on downs , '' And out came Feagles again to punt .
2007_01_01_1815817	27	And Gumbel did not correct himself .
2007_01_01_1815817	28	If his producer , Mark Loomis , tried to help , we do n't know .
2007_01_01_1815817	29	In moments when he converses , debates or jokes with Collinsworth , Gumbel is comfortable ; these exchanges mirror his studio experiences .
2007_01_01_1815817	30	But on the type of plays during which Al Michaels , Jim Nantz , Joe Buck and Mike Tirico raise their voices and provide exciting and detailed calls , Gumbel does n't .
2007_01_01_1815817	31	On Barber 's first touchdown run Saturday night , Gumbel and Collinsworth were mired in a conversation about the Redskins ' lack of takeaways this season ; Barber had been knocked over and was on his feet before Gumbel caught up to the play .
2007_01_01_1815817	32	Gumbel 's call of Barber 's second rushing score , of 55 yards , was passable , but his description of Barber 's final touchdown run , a 50-yarder , was rendered this way : '' First down , Giants .
2007_01_01_1815817	33	He broke for four seconds of silence , without noting the yard lines Barber was passing , the Redskins he was outrunning or the defenders who missed tackling him .
2007_01_01_1815817	34	Then he resumed the call : '' Touchdown , Giants . ''
2007_01_01_1815817	35	Afterward , he fell silent for a few more seconds , then offered some of the details he should have given during the immediate , live call .
2007_01_01_1815817	36	The task , though , is to be quiet -- or '' lay out '' -- after a touchdown , not during it .
2007_01_01_1815817	37	Gumbel has shown at the highest level that his career shift -- from what he has called semi-retirement -- was more difficult than he could have imagined .
2007_01_01_1815817	38	He has 11 months until his next broadcast to prove that he can be better than the play-by-play announcers who are ranked lowest on Fox 's or CBS 's depth charts .

2007_01_01_1815818	0	For the Jets and the Giants , today is a rare happy New Year : It is only the fifth time the two New York pro football franchises have been together in the Super Bowl tournament .
2007_01_01_1815818	1	That 's together in a Sunday doubleheader , but not in momentum , with the Jets soaring into New England for a 1 p.m. game and the Giants stumbling into Philadelphia at 4:30 p.m. .
2007_01_01_1815818	2	The Jets ( 10-6 ) won five of their past six games , including yesterday 's 23-3 domination of the Raiders .
2007_01_01_1815818	3	The Giants , with Tiki Barber slashing for 234 rushing yards and 3 touchdowns in Saturday night 's 34-28 triumph against the Redskins , squeezed into the playoffs with an 8-8 record after losing six of their previous seven games .
2007_01_01_1815818	4	To listen to quarterback Chad Pennington 's synopsis of the Jets ' success , it would seem that the teams are not together in another important area . ''
2007_01_01_1815818	5	It 's about the players believing in the coach , and the coaches believing in the players , '' Pennington said .
2007_01_01_1815818	6	The way the Jets finished their relatively easy schedule , they surely believe in Coach Eric Mangini , who finally used the word playoffs in a sentence after his Gatorade shower , and he believes in them .
2007_01_01_1815818	7	But the way the Giants had to depend on Barber to outscore the Redskins , a 5-11 disappointment , it 's difficult to know if they believe in Coach Tom Coughlin and his staff , and if Coughlin believes in his injury-depleted roster .
2007_01_01_1815818	8	An 8-8 record is not necessarily a quick lose-and-out for a wild card .
2007_01_01_1815818	9	In the years since the 16-game schedule began in 1978 , six other 8-8 teams reached the playoffs via the wild card and two of them won an opening-round game on the road before losing in the divisional round .
2007_01_01_1815818	10	Two years ago , the Vikings and the Rams were 8-8 in gaining the National Football Conference playoffs .
2007_01_01_1815818	11	The Vikings upset the Packers , 31-17 , before losing to the Eagles , 27-14 ; and the Rams stunned the Seahawks , 27-20 , before losing to the Falcons , 47-17 .
2007_01_01_1815818	12	The four 8-8 wild-card teams that lost in the opening round included the 1991 Jets , who fell in Houston , 17-10 , after sneaking into the playoffs with an overtime victory in Miami , as well as the 1999 Cowboys , the 1999 Lions and the 1990 Saints .
2007_01_01_1815818	13	The 1985 Browns won their division with an 8-8 record and lost to the Dolphins in their first playoff game .
2007_01_01_1815818	14	In a third coaching chess match between Mangini and his mentor , Bill Belichick , the Jets would seem to have a puncher 's chance against the Patriots , whom they defeated , 17-14 , in Foxborough after an early season 24-17 loss at Giants Stadium .
2007_01_01_1815818	15	But it wo n't be easy for Pennington to win a passing duel with Tom Brady , a three-time Super Bowl winner .
2007_01_01_1815818	16	The Giants do n't seem to have the manpower ( and maybe the will power ) to upset the Eagles , especially in Philadelphia .
2007_01_01_1815818	17	The Giants split with the Eagles , winning by 30-24 in overtime in Philadelphia on Eli Manning 's three touchdown passes , but losing , 36-22 , at Giants Stadium a little more than two weeks ago .
2007_01_01_1815818	18	Against the Redskins on Saturday night , Barber had the best game any Giants running back ever had , especially when a victory meant so much not only to him as the last regular-season game of his career before he disappears into a television studio , but also to the salvation of a season that loomed as a disaster .
2007_01_01_1815818	19	For all the wonderful games played by the Giants ' Hall of Fame running backs -- Frank Gifford , Tuffy Leemans and Ken Strong -- and by Joe Morris and Rodney Hampton , none of those stars carried the Giants the way Barber did at FedEx Field , across the Potomac River from Virginia , where he grew up as a Redskins fan .
2007_01_01_1815818	20	But against the Eagles in what could be his last game , Barber will be running against one of the N.F.L. 's toughest defenses .
2007_01_01_1815818	21	There wo n't be many holes for him to dart through , and the Eagles ' demon safety , Brian Dawkins , wo n't be as easy to outrun as the Redskins .
2007_01_01_1815818	22	The Jets not only survived , but thrived without their future Hall of Fame running back Curtis Martin , the fourth-leading career rusher in pro football with more 14,000 yards .
2007_01_01_1815818	23	Martin was never activated after having knee surgery late last season -- another tribute to Mangini 's day-to-day mantra for his players : Try to win the next game and try to make progress . ''
2007_01_01_1815818	24	We have n't had the time to doubt ourselves and to ask , what if ? ''
2007_01_01_1815818	25	Pennington said , alluding to Martin . ''
2007_01_01_1815818	26	It 's been full go since Day 1 .
2007_01_01_1815818	27	Our young guys who have n't had opportunities before but had them now have stepped to the forefront .
2007_01_01_1815818	28	Each week , somebody you may not have heard from stepped up and made the play .
2007_01_01_1815818	29	That 's what football is all about . ''
2007_01_01_1815818	30	In Martin 's absence , the rookie Leon Washington , a fourth-round selection with the draft choice awarded to the Jets when the Chiefs hired Herman Edwards as their coach , rushed for 650 yards .
2007_01_01_1815818	31	Cedric Houston had 374 and Kevan Barlow 370 .
2007_01_01_1815818	32	That adds up to 1,394 yards , about what a healthy Martin might have had .
2007_01_01_1815818	33	But a yard is a yard is a yard , no matter who gets it .
2007_01_01_1815818	34	So the Jets , riding Pennington 's cool comeback from his second rotator-cuff operation , are soaring into the playoffs as the Giants stumble in .
2007_01_01_1815818	35	And for only the fifth time , they 're both there .
2007_01_01_1815819	0	Laveranues Coles 's face brightened when somebody mentioned the block he made to help spring running back Leon Washington on his 15-yard scoring run in the fourth quarter of the Jets ' 23-3 victory against the Oakland Raiders . ''
2007_01_01_1815819	1	I think that explains me totally , '' Coles said . ''
2007_01_01_1815819	2	I can go out and make all the catches in the world , but I think the most important things I do are the little things .
2007_01_01_1815819	3	I take more pride in blocking and watching other guys score and stuff like that than anything . ''
2007_01_01_1815819	4	Quarterback Chad Pennington threw to Coles twice unsuccessfully in the end zone , but on Sunday he was mostly used as a decoy , drawing double-teams to open the field for Jerricho Cotchery , who had 7 catches for 53 yards , and Justin McCareins , who caught 5 passes for 27 yards .
2007_01_01_1815819	5	Coles had two catches to finish the regular season with a career-high 91 , one more than he had in 2004 with the Washington Redskins .
2007_01_01_1815819	6	It was by design that Coles did not run many routes across the middle ; the game plan was to keep him out of harm 's way as much as possible .
2007_01_01_1815819	7	He was playing six days after sustaining a concussion in a helmet-to-helmet hit in the second quarter of the Jets ' 13-10 victory at Miami .
2007_01_01_1815819	8	Coles played the second half against the Dolphins but did not practice all week . ''
2007_01_01_1815819	9	He 's pretty banged up right now , '' Cotchery said . ''
2007_01_01_1815819	10	He 's a warrior .
2007_01_01_1815819	11	To see him take the hit he took last week when he did n't know where he was at and come back to play today is amazing to me . ''
2007_01_01_1815819	12	Jets Coach Eric Mangini does not talk about injuries and has made it clear that he expects his players to follow his lead .
2007_01_01_1815819	13	Coles was asked repeatedly about the state of his health after the game and , per Mangini 's edict , refused to comment . ''
2007_01_01_1815819	14	Ask me about the playoffs , '' he said .
2007_01_01_1815819	15	One reporter 's persistent questioning about Coles 's head injury led to a shouting match between the two that ended with two Jets employees stepping in to restrain them . ''
2007_01_01_1815819	16	I 'm sorry you had to see that , '' Coles said after cooling down .
2007_01_01_1815819	17	Coles 's toughness continues to impress Mangini , who said : '' He 's different than other guys who say , ` I 'm O.K. but . '
2007_01_01_1815819	18	He says , ` I 'm O.K. ' He 's so tough he does n't give you anything . ''
2007_01_01_1815820	0	Cornerback David Barrett typifies the mind-set Jets Coach Eric Mangini tried to instill during his first year as a head coach .
2007_01_01_1815820	1	He does not pout about playing time , knowing that his time to contribute will eventually come .
2007_01_01_1815820	2	In the first quarter of the Jets ' 23-3 victory Sunday against the Raiders , Barrett helped give the Jets the momentum when he caused Raiders receiver Johnnie Morant to fumble after he caught a pass at the Oakland 47 .
2007_01_01_1815820	3	Cornerback Hank Poteat recovered and gave the Jets the ball on the Oakland 44 .
2007_01_01_1815820	4	Eight plays later , Chad Pennington hit tight end Chris Baker for a 1-yard touchdown pass and a 7-0 lead for the Jets .
2007_01_01_1815820	5	The Jets did not relinquish the lead .
2007_01_01_1815820	6	Barrett had been thrust into the starting lineup after cornerback Andre Dyson injured his right knee last week and was inactive Sunday .
2007_01_01_1815820	7	Barrett started every game for the Jets in 2004 , the last time they made the playoffs .
2007_01_01_1815820	8	Last season , though , a poke in the eye resulted in a burst blood vessel , and he was limited to starting in eight games .
2007_01_01_1815820	9	He has been bothered by a hip injury this season , and Sunday was only his third start .
2007_01_01_1815820	10	Standing in the middle of the Jets ' raucous locker room after the game , Barrett said he simply tried to be prepared '' whenever it is your turn to be ready . ''
2007_01_01_1815820	11	The Raiders ' offense scored the fewest points of any team in the league this season , and the Jets ' ability to score early increased the pressure on Oakland quarterback Aaron Brooks and running back Justin Fargas .
2007_01_01_1815820	12	Brooks was 15 of 26 for 136 yards and Fargas ran for 79 yards on 17 attempts .
2007_01_01_1815820	13	The Raiders ' only score came on a 35-yard field goal by Sebastian Janikowski in the second quarter . ''
2007_01_01_1815820	14	We were set up nicely by Dave 's play , '' Baker said of Barrett 's forced fumble . ''
2007_01_01_1815820	15	That turnover was pretty big for us to get up early on them . ''
2007_01_01_1815820	16	The expectations were not high for the Jets coming into the season , but behind a defense that has allowed 18.4 points a game this season and a balanced offense from Pennington and the rookie running back Leon Washington , the Jets ( 10-6 ) are in the playoffs as a wild card and will visit the New England Patriots ( 12-4 ) on Sunday .
2007_01_01_1815825	0	Even Chad Henne , the Michigan quarterback , called this year 's Rose Bowl '' almost like a consolation match . ''
2007_01_01_1815825	1	And Henne is as enthusiastic as anyone about Monday 's game between the Wolverines and Southern California in Pasadena .
2007_01_01_1815825	2	There is just no avoiding the feeling of a letdown because Ohio State , ranked first in the Bowl Championship Series standings , will play Florida , ranked second , in the B.C.S. national championship game on Jan. 8 in Glendale , Ariz. .
2007_01_01_1815825	3	The Wolverines of the Big Ten and Trojans of the Pacific-10 had each hoped to play for the B.C.S. championship but lost their regular-season finales to their biggest conference rivals -- -- the Wolverines to Ohio State , the Trojans to U.C.L.A. .
2007_01_01_1815825	4	This has turned the '' Granddaddy of Them All '' into something of a stepchild despite the pairing of two glamorous teams from the two leagues that traditionally play here .
2007_01_01_1815825	5	U.S.C. Coach Pete Carroll acknowledged the perception Sunday when asked if the B.C.S. had done a disservice to the Rose Bowl and other major postseason games . ''
2007_01_01_1815825	6	There has been an effect on the games and how you can posture these games in terms of importance , '' Carroll said . ''
2007_01_01_1815825	7	Has that taken something away from it ?
2007_01_01_1815825	8	I do n't know who 's worried about the conscience or the stature of these games . ''
2007_01_01_1815825	9	But based on the teams ' rankings , the Rose Bowl would be the second-best bowl game .
2007_01_01_1815825	10	The Wolverines ( 11-1 ) are third in the B.C.S. , the Trojans ( 10-2 ) fifth .
2007_01_01_1815825	11	There remains a minuscule chance that a Florida ( 12-1 ) upset of Ohio State ( 12-0 ) in a ragged game , coupled with a Michigan rout of U.S.C. , might encourage voters in the Associated Press poll , which is not affiliated with the B.C.S. , to award Michigan a slice of an unofficial national championship .
2007_01_01_1815825	12	But that is unlikely .
2007_01_01_1815825	13	With both Michigan and U.S.C. planning on the return of many star players next season , the Rose Bowl winner may earn only the right to be considered first in the nation when preseason rankings are compiled for 2007 .
2007_01_01_1815825	14	Michigan linebacker Shawn Crable said he did not think the Rose Bowl would make or break next season , but he added , '' Next season , we might see them again . ''
2007_01_01_1815825	15	The Trojans are 21-9 in the Rose Bowl , but lost their last appearance , to Texas last season , when it was the B.C.S. championship game .
2007_01_01_1815825	16	The Wolverines are 8-11 here and have lost their last two visits , to Texas in 2005 and to U.S.C. in 2004 .
2007_01_01_1815825	17	But Michigan is thought to be improved from those seasons , while U.S.C. had a less-impressive season , by its high standards .
2007_01_01_1815825	18	Crable and defensive end LaMarr Woodley give the Michigan defense star power , Carroll said .
2007_01_01_1815825	19	They will target Trojans quarterback John David Booty , much as they attacked Troy Smith of Ohio State .
2007_01_01_1815825	20	Despite losing by 42-39 to the Buckeyes on Nov. 18 , the Wolverines punished Smith with many hard hits .
2007_01_01_1815825	21	Booty is less mobile than Smith , who won the Heisman Trophy , and the Wolverines have watched film of Booty 's subpar performance when the Bruins upset the Trojans , 13-9 , on Dec. 2 . ''
2007_01_01_1815825	22	Being a pass rusher , I saw them coming off the edge , '' Woodley said , referring to the Bruins ' pass rush against Booty . ''
2007_01_01_1815825	23	We might do some similar things to him . ''
2007_01_01_1815825	24	Of the Michigan front four , Booty said : '' The big guys can bull rush up the middle and then speed rush on the outside .
2007_01_01_1815825	25	Usually , teams have one or the other and you can move outside or step up .
2007_01_01_1815825	26	But it looks like , with them , you ca n't really do either . ''
2007_01_01_1815825	27	Henne , a junior , said he planned to return next season , as did the junior running back Mike Hart .
2007_01_01_1815825	28	Jake Long , an all-American offensive tackle who will be a fifth-year senior , has also said he would come back .
2007_01_01_1815825	29	Henne has a strong receiving corps , including the senior Steve Breaston , the sophomore Mario Manningham and the junior Adrian Arrington .
2007_01_01_1815825	30	Among those who will cover them is an 18-year-old freshman free safety , Taylor Mays .
2007_01_01_1815825	31	Mays 's father , Stafford Mays , played professionally for Minnesota when Carroll was an assistant coach for the Vikings .
2007_01_01_1815825	32	The younger Mays got his first start in the second game because of an injury .
2007_01_01_1815825	33	Is he ready for the pressure of the Rose Bowl ? ''
2007_01_01_1815825	34	I have n't really had time to be nervous , '' Mays said .
2007_01_01_1815825	35	The Trojans ' star receiver , Dwayne Jarrett , will go against his friend Leon Hall , the star cornerback of Michigan .
2007_01_01_1815825	36	When asked about the anti-climactic feeling of the Rose Bowl , Jarrett said : '' This is the game we have to play in .
2007_01_01_1815825	37	Just live with it . ''
2007_01_01_1815827	0	A few minutes into Sunday 's game against Atlanta , a hard season finally got easy for the Philadelphia Eagles .
2007_01_01_1815827	1	The National Football Conference East was clinched for the fifth time in six seasons , win or lose against the Falcons .
2007_01_01_1815827	2	Eventually , Philadelphia won its fifth game in a row , 24-17 , on an 89-yard touchdown pass in the fourth quarter from the reserve quarterback A. J. Feeley to receiver Hank Baskett , setting up a playoff opener next Sunday here against the Giants and concluding a jarring day of celebration and anticlimax .
2007_01_01_1815827	3	With 10 minutes 44 seconds remaining in the first quarter , word filtered to the well-oiled fans at Lincoln Financial Field : The hated Dallas Cowboys had lost at home to Detroit .
2007_01_01_1815827	4	So the Eagles ( 10-6 ) had won the division , a feat that seemed impossible in November after quarterback Donovan McNabb tore a ligament in his knee and Philadelphia hobbled to five defeats in six games .
2007_01_01_1815827	5	The 69,341 fans stood and cheered Sunday , and many shouted a familiar , dismissive curse at the Cowboys .
2007_01_01_1815827	6	It was an incongruous moment , considering that Atlanta was driving for a temporary 7-3 lead .
2007_01_01_1815827	7	The New Year 's Eve celebration had officially begun for the Eagles and their faithful .
2007_01_01_1815827	8	Quarterback Jeff Garcia and running back Brian Westbrook went to the bench after one series .
2007_01_01_1815827	9	More regulars soon followed .
2007_01_01_1815827	10	In this fragile season , Coach Andy Reid was taking no chances .
2007_01_01_1815827	11	The game became a glorified scrimmage , highlighted by Feeley 's 22 completions on 33 attempts for 331 yards and 3 touchdowns .
2007_01_01_1815827	12	As the Eagles ' unlikely late-season revival continued , Philadelphia 's supporters were able to revel in the underdog role they have long embraced , and to anticipate the Giants in the wild-card matchup .
2007_01_01_1815827	13	If the Eagles are not the best team in the N.F.C. , they are the hottest . ''
2007_01_01_1815827	14	We 're a little like zombies , '' Reid said . ''
2007_01_01_1815827	15	Back from the dead . ''
2007_01_01_1815827	16	Playing a division rival for a third time this season will not bring complete assurance to the locals .
2007_01_01_1815827	17	They remember all too queasily how the Giants recovered from a 24-7 deficit here Sept. 17 and won , 30-24 , in overtime .
2007_01_01_1815827	18	And Philadelphia 's 36-22 victory at Giants Stadium on Dec. 17 was not secured without 22 points in the fourth quarter , including an interception returned for a touchdown . ''
2007_01_01_1815827	19	It was a good one , '' Reid said of the N.F.C. East title , but added , '' We 're not done .
2007_01_01_1815827	20	The Giants are coming in .
2007_01_01_1815827	21	We know how those games go . ''
2007_01_01_1815827	22	For a moment , though , the Giants could wait .
2007_01_01_1815827	23	This was a day for the players and the fans to savor Philadelphia 's resilience in a season recovered , like a misplaced overcoat , from the lost and found .
2007_01_01_1815827	24	Shawn Andrews , the Pro Bowl guard , jumped up and down on the field like a kid with a newly opened present .
2007_01_01_1815827	25	Fireworks exploded from the rim of the stadium .
2007_01_01_1815827	26	Some Eagles fans placed the revival in a cinematic context , noting that the season was bookended by two Philadelphia-inspired films -- '' Invincible , '' the story of Vince Papale , who did not play college football and made the Eagles in a public tryout in 1976 ; and '' Rocky Balboa , '' the latest in a series that for three decades has glorified the city 's blue-collar ethos . ''
2007_01_01_1815827	27	We always see ourselves as the underdogs , '' Emily Ditzler of Lansdale , Pa. , said . ''
2007_01_01_1815827	28	It 's the whole '' Rocky '' thing .
2007_01_01_1815827	29	A lot of it has to do with the recovery from last year and fighting our way back .
2007_01_01_1815827	30	Everyone said we could n't win .
2007_01_01_1815827	31	We wanted to prove we could do something without T. O. '' After a 6-10 season a year ago , which included a dyspeptic McNabb-Terrell Owens feud that led to Owens being discarded , the Eagles started this season 4-1 , only to have McNabb wreck his knee .
2007_01_01_1815827	32	Many fans preferred Feeley , not Garcia , as McNabb 's replacement , and even booed Garcia during a Monday night game against Carolina on Dec. 4 .
2007_01_01_1815827	33	But Garcia threw a 40-yard touchdown pass in the fourth quarter , Philadelphia won , 27-24 .
2007_01_01_1815827	34	It has not lost since , winning three consecutive division games on the road and balancing its passing with a clock-chewing running game .
2007_01_01_1815827	35	Now , Garcia has been seamlessly folded into Philadelphia 's underdog myth -- a 36-year-old , undrafted out of college , unwanted largely by the N.F.L. after recent horrid seasons in Detroit and Cleveland . ''
2007_01_01_1815827	36	We love him , first , because he 's winning , '' Shaun Young , a fan from Media , Pa. , said . ''
2007_01_01_1815827	37	We love his energy ; he gets in guy 's faces .
2007_01_01_1815827	38	He 's a blue-collar guy ; he 's been through a lot . ''
2007_01_01_1815827	39	But this is Philadelphia , after all .
2007_01_01_1815827	40	Affection here blinks on and off like traffic lights .
2007_01_01_1815827	41	And the playoffs have yet to start . ''
2007_01_01_1815827	42	He 's no-nonsense and he 's winning , '' Fran DiBeneditto of Downingtown , Pa. , said of Garcia . ''
2007_01_01_1815827	43	If we were losing , he could be fiery and we 'd hate him . ''
2007_01_01_1815828	0	After running through the gamut of emotions , from the highest highs late last week to another stupefying low Sunday afternoon , the Knicks were left with a bad case of whiplash .
2007_01_01_1815828	1	Then again , the condition might simply have been a product of watching their shots fly in the opposite direction .
2007_01_01_1815828	2	The Knicks converted a season-low 34.5 percent of their field-goals attempts Sunday , in large part because 16 of their attempts were swatted away by the Los Angeles Clippers , who cruised to a 90-80 victory at the Staples Center .
2007_01_01_1815828	3	Elton Brand accounted for eight of those blocks , a career high , and scored an efficient 32 points to ruin the Knicks ' New Year 's Eve .
2007_01_01_1815828	4	The defeat denied the Knicks ( 13-20 ) a chance to claim a share of first place in the Atlantic Division .
2007_01_01_1815828	5	It prevented them from recording a .500 record in December , leaving them 7-9 .
2007_01_01_1815828	6	And , combined with Friday night 's lopsided loss in Phoenix , it wiped out all the exhilaration of the previous two weeks .
2007_01_01_1815828	7	That triple-overtime victory last week against Detroit already seems like a distant memory . ''
2007_01_01_1815828	8	I 'd be lying if I told you I was n't frustrated right now , '' forward David Lee said . ''
2007_01_01_1815828	9	All our guys are frustrated . ''
2007_01_01_1815828	10	The Knicks trailed wire to wire , by as many as 24 points , and never got closer than 10 in the second half .
2007_01_01_1815828	11	They also trailed by as many as 24 points in Phoenix , where they never got closer than 11 .
2007_01_01_1815828	12	But the Clippers ( 14-16 ) are not the Suns , and Coach Isiah Thomas surely expected his team to have learned something in Saturday 's extensive film session here .
2007_01_01_1815828	13	But there are lessons that still elude them and the most damaging one is how to keep the offense rolling when Eddy Curry is double-teamed .
2007_01_01_1815828	14	The Clippers , like the Suns , crowded Curry every time he touched the ball .
2007_01_01_1815828	15	Curry made 5 of 13 shots , and six of his seven misses were blocked .
2007_01_01_1815828	16	He finished with 15 points . ''
2007_01_01_1815828	17	It seemed like they were coming from everywhere tonight , '' Curry said .
2007_01_01_1815828	18	The Knicks do not have the shooters to keep defenses honest .
2007_01_01_1815828	19	Indeed , their forward rotation is littered with players who have no reliable jump shot -- Lee , Jared Jeffries and Renaldo Balkman .
2007_01_01_1815828	20	Jeffries played just 15 minutes Sunday . ''
2007_01_01_1815828	21	I do n't think it 's Eddy 's fault , whatsoever , '' Lee said . ''
2007_01_01_1815828	22	He 's getting double-teamed and guys need to step up and make a play , myself included . ''
2007_01_01_1815828	23	It would help to have the injured Quentin Richardson back .
2007_01_01_1815828	24	But the Knicks also need Curry to take the next step as a franchise player , and diversify his game . ''
2007_01_01_1815828	25	It 's just different because of how they 're guarding Eddy now , '' Stephon Marbury said . ''
2007_01_01_1815828	26	Once Eddy understands that he 's going to be double-teamed for the remainder of his career , it 's going to be tough for us until he understands that .
2007_01_01_1815828	27	He 's starting to learn that when the trap comes to kick it out right away and repost .
2007_01_01_1815828	28	This is all brand new to him . ''
2007_01_01_1815828	29	Thomas tried everything Sunday -- playing Curry and Jerome James as co-centers , benching Jeffries for long stretches , and leaning hard on the rookie Mardy Collins .
2007_01_01_1815828	30	Curry and Jamal Crawford were on the bench in the fourth quarter when a unit featuring James , Collins , Lee , Marbury and Channing Frye cut a 24-point deficit to 84-74 with 3 minutes 36 seconds to play .
2007_01_01_1815828	31	The Clippers responded with three quick baskets . ''
2007_01_01_1815828	32	I was just searching , pushing every button I could push tonight , '' Thomas said . ''
2007_01_01_1815828	33	And I finally got a group out there that had some semblance of working together and I just tried to stick with it . ''
2007_01_01_1815828	34	While Richardson missed his eighth game in a row because of back spasms , the Knicks ' guards had another terrible shooting performance .
2007_01_01_1815828	35	Crawford was 2 for 8 and Marbury 3 for 13 .
2007_01_01_1815828	36	Collins , in his first game back from a suspension , was the best shooter , hitting 4 of 9 shots , including three 3-pointers .
2007_01_01_1815828	37	He finished with a career-high 11 points and is likely to keep his rotation spot while Richardson and Steve Francis recover from injuries . ''
2007_01_01_1815828	38	He was definitely a bright spot , '' Thomas said of Collins . ''
2007_01_01_1815828	39	I hope I can keep finding him minutes . ''
2007_01_01_1815828	40	For Collins , every game is a chance to make a name for himself .
2007_01_01_1815828	41	Until then , the image of him is as the guy who committed the flagrant foul that set off the brawl with Denver . ''
2007_01_01_1815828	42	It 's definitely tough to be known , the first thing you come in the league , to be known as a guy that 's like this and like that , '' Collins said . ''
2007_01_01_1815828	43	So my whole thing is to try to go out there and prove to them and show them I can actually play basketball , try to forget about the whole situation . ''
2007_01_01_1815828	44	REBOUNDS Steve Francis was back in a suit and tie Sunday afternoon , resting his right knee ( tendinitis ) .
2007_01_01_1815828	45	Francis played sparingly last week , when the Knicks desperately needed another guard , but he was limited . ''
2007_01_01_1815828	46	I ca n't do anything , '' Francis said . ''
2007_01_01_1815828	47	It 's constant pain at all times .
2007_01_01_1815828	48	I could n't run or stop . ''
2007_01_01_1815828	49	Nate Robinson , barred from attending N.B.A. games during his suspension , went to the U.C.L.A.-Washington game at Pauley Pavilion .
2007_01_01_1815828	50	Robinson played three years for Washington before being drafted by the Knicks in 2005 .
2007_01_01_1815828	51	PRO BASKETBALL Correction : January 3 , 2007 , Wednesday A sports article on Monday about the Knicks ' 90-80 loss to the Clippers in Los Angeles misidentified the team that drafted guard Nate Robinson in 2005 .
2007_01_01_1815828	52	It was the Phoenix Suns , who selected him at the Knicks ' request , then traded him and Quentin Richardson to the Knicks for Kurt Thomas the same day ; the Knicks did not draft Robinson .
2007_01_01_1815829	0	The scene inside Suite 48 at Lincoln Financial Field yesterday was warm , lively and occasionally raucous .
2007_01_01_1815829	1	Donovan McNabb , the Philadelphia Eagles ' injured quarterback , sat and cheered with his mother , Wilma ; his father , Sam ; and a cluster of friends and their children .
2007_01_01_1815829	2	They bleed Eagles green .
2007_01_01_1815829	3	This was the season finale , and the Eagles were playing the demoralized Atlanta Falcons in a game that was supposed to have been an electric crescendo to a fascinating season .
2007_01_01_1815829	4	If Dallas defeated Detroit at home , as was expected , then Philadelphia would have to defeat Atlanta to win the division .
2007_01_01_1815829	5	In fitting fashion for a season defined by parity , the Lions upset the Cowboys , 39-31 .
2007_01_01_1815829	6	Philadelphia , without lifting a finger , won its fifth National Football Conference East title in eight seasons .
2007_01_01_1815829	7	The Eagles completed a fantastic run , a run that assumed an extraordinary dimension on Nov. 19 when McNabb sustained a season-ending knee injury .
2007_01_01_1815829	8	Eagles fans screamed for the backup A. J. Feeley , Coach Andy Reid gave them Jeff Garcia , and Garcia responded by giving Philadelphia a season to remember .
2007_01_01_1815829	9	The underlying question in Suite 48 was whether Eagles fans will remember McNabb .
2007_01_01_1815829	10	This was the subject of a blog posting last week written by McNabb 's mother on his Web site .
2007_01_01_1815829	11	She wondered where her son 's injury , and Garcia 's performance in relief , would leave her son in the minds of the fans . ''
2007_01_01_1815829	12	The win this week was great , and I could actually say that 's what I wanted for Christmas , '' she wrote , referring to the Eagles ' 23-7 victory over the Cowboys on Monday . ''
2007_01_01_1815829	13	Yes , now we have solidly beat the Cowboys with my son and without him .
2007_01_01_1815829	14	But I can hear you asking , mama McNabb what are you really thinking ?
2007_01_01_1815829	15	Well here it is , the real deal . ''
2007_01_01_1815829	16	It 's kind of bittersweet for me as my son , the quarterback sits out on injured reserved watching the game during his rehab , '' she added . ''
2007_01_01_1815829	17	I polled my family too , and they feel the same .
2007_01_01_1815829	18	We want our team to win and even go to the Super Bowl and win it in Miami especially if they continue to play as they have .
2007_01_01_1815829	19	But oh oh , if they win the Super Bowl without my son , what would be the real outcome with the fans ?
2007_01_01_1815829	20	Will they crucify him ?
2007_01_01_1815829	21	Maybe , then the trade talks would begin . ''
2007_01_01_1815829	22	McNabb said yesterday that he really did n't want to talk about his injury and that he did n't want to be a distraction to the team .
2007_01_01_1815829	23	So he cheered lustily . ''
2007_01_01_1815829	24	I never get that many chances to do this , '' he said .
2007_01_01_1815829	25	Jeff Garcia is the latest toast of Philadelphia , but we 'll see how long that lasts .
2007_01_01_1815829	26	If the Eagles lose to the Giants next Sunday ( and that is a real possibility ) , trust me , the fans will be screaming for McNabb .
2007_01_01_1815829	27	I spoke with McNabb recently when he was in New York announcing an initiative for managing diabetes .
2007_01_01_1815829	28	He spoke about the ups and downs of playing quarterback , the most intriguing position in team sports .
2007_01_01_1815829	29	It does n't matter if you 're McNabb or Garcia , Eli or Peyton Manning .
2007_01_01_1815829	30	Acceptance hangs by a thread . ''
2007_01_01_1815829	31	It 's grueling , '' McNabb said then . ''
2007_01_01_1815829	32	You have a great game , and they talk about us like we 're the best thing since sliced bread .
2007_01_01_1815829	33	But as soon as you have that bad game , it 's like darts are flying your way .
2007_01_01_1815829	34	That comes with the territory , and it 's something you just have to deal with . ''
2007_01_01_1815829	35	McNabb and the organization will have to deal with this as long as the Eagles keep winning with Garcia .
2007_01_01_1815829	36	In 2004 , McNabb became the third African-American quarterback to play in a Super Bowl .
2007_01_01_1815829	37	Being an African-American quarterback adds yet another layer to the pressure that goes along with the position .
2007_01_01_1815829	38	Despite the success of Vince Young and Steve McNair , McNabb believes that he may be held to higher standards , may be on a shorter leash .
2007_01_01_1815829	39	He was marginalized by Rush Limbaugh , roasted by the local N.A.A.C.P. president and showed up by a star receiver , Terrell Owens .
2007_01_01_1815829	40	When asked about society 's acceptance of African-American quarterbacks , McNabb said : '' I personally do n't feel that we 've turned the corner .
2007_01_01_1815829	41	We get criticized a little differently from most people .
2007_01_01_1815829	42	It 's always , ` We 've got to get somebody else in there , ' or ` He 's not doing what he needs to do , ' when in a lot of cases , I 'm doing the same thing someone else is doing but better . ''
2007_01_01_1815829	43	Will Eagles fans rally behind McNabb next season , for old time 's sake , or will they adopt Garcia ?
2007_01_01_1815829	44	Kyle Leyrer of Royers , Pa. , 23 , was in the parking lot before yesterday 's game . ''
2007_01_01_1815829	45	I still like McNabb , '' Leyrer said . ''
2007_01_01_1815829	46	He 's one of the greats in Eagles history .
2007_01_01_1815829	47	He 'll be Hall of Famer . ''
2007_01_01_1815829	48	Asked about Garcia 's success , Leyrer said , '' McNabb would be doing the same thing if he was playing . ''
2007_01_01_1815829	49	McNabb turned 30 last month .
2007_01_01_1815829	50	His body has taken punishment : a broken ankle , a sports hernia , busted ribs and now this knee injury .
2007_01_01_1815829	51	The Eagles have played in four N.F.C. championship games in the past five years and reached the Super Bowl after the 2004 season , losing to New England .
2007_01_01_1815829	52	The Eagles defeated Atlanta , 24-17 , yesterday and will play host to a playoff game Sunday .
2007_01_01_1815829	53	McNabb will be in Suite 48 cheering and hurting , bleeding Eagles green , wondering if the totality of what he has accomplished in Philadelphia will be enough to make fans remember his name in the new year .
2007_01_01_1815829	54	I think McNabb will be fine .
2007_01_01_1815829	55	Philadelphia lost a major chunk of its soul when Allen Iverson was traded to Denver .
2007_01_01_1815829	56	The city does n't want to lose its spirit as well .
2007_01_01_1815829	57	SPORTS OF THE TIMES E-mail : wcr@nytimes.com
2007_01_01_1815830	0	For Sunni Arabs here , the ugly reality of the new Iraq seemed to crystallize in a two-minute segment of Saddam Hussein 's hanging , filmed surreptitiously on a cellphone .
2007_01_01_1815830	1	The video featured excited taunting of Mr. Hussein by hooded Shiite guards .
2007_01_01_1815830	2	Passed around from cellphone to cellphone on Sunday , the images had echoes of the videos Sunni militants take of beheadings . ''
2007_01_01_1815830	3	Yes , he was a dictator , but he was killed by a death squad , '' said a Sunni Arab woman in western Baghdad who was too afraid to give her name . ''
2007_01_01_1815830	4	What 's the difference between him and them ? ''
2007_01_01_1815830	5	There was , of course , a difference .
2007_01_01_1815830	6	Mr. Hussein was a brutal dictator , while the Shiite organizers of the execution are members of the popularly elected Iraqi government that the United States helped put in place as an attempt to implant a democracy .
2007_01_01_1815830	7	It was supposed to be a formal and solemn proceeding carried out by a dispassionate state .
2007_01_01_1815830	8	But the grainy recording of the execution 's cruel theater summed up what has become increasingly clear on the streets of the capital : that the Shiite-led government that assumed power in the American effort here is running the state under an undisguised sectarian banner .
2007_01_01_1815830	9	The hanging was hasty .
2007_01_01_1815830	10	Laws governing its timing were bypassed , and the guards charged with keeping order in the chamber instead disrupted it , shouting Shiite militia slogans .
2007_01_01_1815830	11	It was a degrading end for a vicious leader , and an ominous beginning for the new Iraq .
2007_01_01_1815830	12	The Bush administration has already scaled back its hopes for a democracy here .
2007_01_01_1815830	13	But as the Iraqi government has become ever more set on protecting its Shiite constituency , often at the expense of the Sunni minority , the goal of stopping the sectarian war seems to be slipping out of reach . ''
2007_01_01_1815830	14	We speak about the crimes of Saddam Hussein , but now here we are behaving in the same way , '' said Alaa Makki , a prominent Sunni politician . ''
2007_01_01_1815830	15	We fear that nothing has been changed .
2007_01_01_1815830	16	On the contrary , we feel it is going in a worse direction . ''
2007_01_01_1815830	17	After the invasion , Sunni Arabs , bitter at losing their place , refused to take part in Iraq 's first elections , allowing Shiites and Kurds to sweep to power .
2007_01_01_1815830	18	Americans here spent the following months persuading the Shiites to let the Sunnis back in .
2007_01_01_1815830	19	The idea , at the time , was that involving Sunnis in politics would drain the insurgency of its violence .
2007_01_01_1815830	20	Instead , the violence got worse , and in February , the long-abused Shiites struck back , using the force of the state ministries and agencies that they now control .
2007_01_01_1815830	21	Now , American officials are pressing Iraqi leaders , both Sunni and Shiite , to reconcile and have made it a central demand for continued support of the Iraqi government .
2007_01_01_1815830	22	But the prospects for mutual agreement seem ever more distant . ''
2007_01_01_1815830	23	I ca n't think of any good reason for any level-minded person to be interested in reconciliation , '' one secular Sunni politician said .
2007_01_01_1815830	24	That unwillingness , shared by most of the Shiite political elite , is a serious challenge to any new American strategy proposal that President Bush may announce soon .
2007_01_01_1815830	25	Indeed , the Sunni political class is getting smaller .
2007_01_01_1815830	26	Many of the Sunni politicians once ubiquitous during the broad discussions of the Iraqi Constitution two years ago are now gone .
2007_01_01_1815830	27	Virtually none of the members of the Association of Muslim Scholars , a hard-line Sunni Arab religious group , are left in Iraq -- most of them have gone to Jordan and Syria .
2007_01_01_1815830	28	Out of more than 50 members of the Baghdad council that runs the city , only one is Sunni .
2007_01_01_1815830	29	The reason is that Shiites , who had been driven from their homes and relentlessly slaughtered by Sunni suicide bombers , are now pushing back .
2007_01_01_1815830	30	The taunting during Mr. Hussein 's execution capped months of advances by Shiite militias , which have forced Sunnis farther back into western Baghdad .
2007_01_01_1815830	31	But as the Shiites gain the upper hand , they also seem to be abandoning any hint of compromise .
2007_01_01_1815830	32	The video , Sunnis said , was a startling symbol of that .
2007_01_01_1815830	33	In the images , the guards taunt Mr. Hussein .
2007_01_01_1815830	34	They cheer their Shiite heroes so persistently that one observer makes a remark about how the effort to rein in militias does not seem to be going well .
2007_01_01_1815830	35	Immediately after they let him drop , in the midst of repeating a prayer , the voices rise in urgency and begin talking excitedly .
2007_01_01_1815830	36	Then several others chime in , telling those present to step back from the body and to wait three minutes before touching it .
2007_01_01_1815830	37	The video was particularly disturbing for Sunni Arabs , who accuse the government of willfully allowing militias to remain in the ranks of its security forces .
2007_01_01_1815830	38	It left the impression that the government cared more for revenge than for justice , Sunnis said . ''
2007_01_01_1815830	39	Either it 's terrible incompetence or it 's an act of revenge -- a vendetta , '' said Adnan Pachachi , a respected Sunni whose political career began long before Mr. Hussein took power . ''
2007_01_01_1815830	40	That was the impression people had . ''
2007_01_01_1815830	41	One of the problems was the timing .
2007_01_01_1815830	42	The execution was rescheduled a number of times , as Iraqi officials raced through a checklist of requirements put forth by the Americans .
2007_01_01_1815830	43	Two legal conditions -- that it not be held on a holiday and that the Iraqi president and his two deputies be given 30 days to sign off on the sentence first -- were ignored .
2007_01_01_1815830	44	The fact was not lost on Sunni political leaders , including Mr. Makki , who said the execution was a step backward for the country . ''
2007_01_01_1815830	45	This is a political mistake , '' he said . ''
2007_01_01_1815830	46	We lost a lot with this . ''
2007_01_01_1815830	47	To make matters worse , it fell just as the first day of the Id al-Adha holiday dawned for Sunnis -- a day before the Shiites ' observance was to begin .
2007_01_01_1815830	48	Shiite politicians did not apologize and some even reveled in the timing .
2007_01_01_1815830	49	That did a major disservice to reconciliation , many argued . ''
2007_01_01_1815830	50	Why could n't they have waited for a few more days ? ''
2007_01_01_1815830	51	Mr. Pachachi said . ''
2007_01_01_1815830	52	It was a deliberate insult to so many people .
2007_01_01_1815830	53	It helped Saddam 's friends . ''
2007_01_01_1815830	54	Yusra Abdul Aziz , a Sunni teacher in Mansour , had a blunter analysis : '' They changed him from a criminal into a martyr . ''
2007_01_01_1815830	55	In a strange twist , Sunni insurgents did not seem to care .
2007_01_01_1815830	56	Sunni Jihadist Web sites had virtually no messages about Mr. Hussein 's death , aside from two re-released statements , old debates by militant sheiks over whether he should be considered a martyr . ''
2007_01_01_1815830	57	The feeling is that they do n't care about him , '' said Rita Katz , who runs the SITE Institute , a group that tracks militant Islamist Web sites .
2007_01_01_1815830	58	For the more hard-line Sunni Arabs , the execution simply confirmed their view that joining the Shiite government could never work .
2007_01_01_1815830	59	Sheik Hakam Abdullah al-Shahiri from the Obeid tribe in Kirkuk is an example . ''
2007_01_01_1815830	60	Iraq is occupied now by the U.S. and Iran and a puppet government for both sides , '' he said . ''
2007_01_01_1815830	61	With the execution of Saddam the Arab identity of Iraq and its unity have ended . ''
2007_01_01_1815830	62	That has left moderate Sunnis -- those who still seek reconciliation -- to ponder the danger of a Shiite hegemony that seems too scarred from past abuses to govern lightly . ''
2007_01_01_1815830	63	Governing a country should not be done by reflexes , '' Mr. Makki said . ''
2007_01_01_1815830	64	It should be wisdom first .
2007_01_01_1815830	65	A panoramic view . '' ''
2007_01_01_1815830	66	Not behaving from one side , '' he added , '' like what we saw here . ''
2007_01_01_1815830	67	THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ : NEWS ANALYSIS
2007_01_01_1815831	0	Confronted with a second , unofficial and more graphic video account of the moments leading up to the execution of Saddam Hussein , and the hanging itself , executives at television news organizations made a series of what one executive , President Steve Capus of NBC News , called '' delicate editorial decisions '' about what they would put on the air on Saturday night and Sunday to augment the first pictures of the execution .
2007_01_01_1815831	1	The new video , almost certainly shot by a cellphone camera by one of the guards or witnesses at the execution , includes exchanges between Mr. Hussein and either the witnesses or guards leading up to the moment when the trapdoor opens and he falls .
2007_01_01_1815831	2	No national American television organization has thus far allowed the moment of the drop to be shown .
2007_01_01_1815831	3	But the same niceties were not observed on numerous Web sites , which have posted the complete video , including the moment that Mr. Hussein , noose around his neck , falls , and a close-up of his face afterward .
2007_01_01_1815831	4	Some prominent sites , like Google 's video site and the conservative blog Littlegreenfootballs.com , have posted the complete cellphone coverage of the execution , including the moment Mr. Hussein falls from view .
2007_01_01_1815831	5	Fox News and CNN ran the cellphone video -- freezing on Mr. Hussein 's face before the final moment -- most of the day on Sunday .
2007_01_01_1815831	6	Fox was the first to use the video on Saturday evening , after the Arab-language channel Al Jazeera aired it .
2007_01_01_1815831	7	ABC ran some of the video starting in its late newscasts Saturday night .
2007_01_01_1815831	8	David Rhodes , the vice president for news at Fox News , said one reason the network chose to transmit the new video was that it contained the verbal exchanges between Mr. Hussein and those about to put him to death .
2007_01_01_1815831	9	Most television news executives interviewed Sunday said these hostile exchanges made the new video newsworthy .
2007_01_01_1815831	10	Jon Klein , the president of CNN 's domestic operations , said the flavor of sectarianism cinched the decision . ''
2007_01_01_1815831	11	It really was a microcosm of the various strains in Iraqi society at the moment , '' he said .
2007_01_01_1815831	12	THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ Correction : January 4 , 2007 , Thursday An article on Monday about the handling of the video of Saddam Hussein 's execution by television networks and Web sites referred imprecisely to the site littlegreenfootballs.com .
2007_01_01_1815831	13	It posted a link to the video , not the video itself .
2007_01_01_1815832	0	While the Green Bay Packers wonder about Brett Favre 's future , the Chicago Bears worry about Rex Grossman as they head into the playoffs .
2007_01_01_1815832	1	Green Bay 's 26-7 victory Sunday night at Soldier Field had no playoff ramifications , but the game was significant for both starting quarterbacks .
2007_01_01_1815832	2	For Favre , the game was potentially historic .
2007_01_01_1815832	3	For Grossman , it was a nightmare .
2007_01_01_1815832	4	It may have been the final game for Favre , Green Bay 's surefire Hall of Famer , who remains uncertain if he will retire or return for another season .
2007_01_01_1815832	5	Favre , 37 , played splendidly , completing 21 of 42 passes for 285 yards and a touchdown , with one interception .
2007_01_01_1815832	6	If this was goodbye , it was a satisfying farewell .
2007_01_01_1815832	7	After the game , Favre said he would have surgery on his left ankle in Green Bay to clean out bone spurs .
2007_01_01_1815832	8	He said he expected to announce in the next two or three weeks whether he would return .
2007_01_01_1815832	9	Favre ran off the field after the game with tears in his eyes . ''
2007_01_01_1815832	10	If it is the last game , I could n't be more pleased , '' he said during his postgame news conference . ''
2007_01_01_1815832	11	I 've had a blast this year .
2007_01_01_1815832	12	Every player in pro sports would love to go out winning a championship .
2007_01_01_1815832	13	It 's hard to do . ''
2007_01_01_1815832	14	Grossman , however , left many Bears fans wishing that he would retire , or at least be replaced .
2007_01_01_1815832	15	He threw three interceptions in the first half , and two of them were returned for touchdowns .
2007_01_01_1815832	16	Grossman looked shaky and unsure , going 2 of 12 for 33 yards .
2007_01_01_1815832	17	He is the Bears ' biggest concern as they prepare for a potential run to the Super Bowl .
2007_01_01_1815832	18	Finishing with the best record in the National Football Conference earned the Bears ( 13-3 ) a first-round bye before they open the playoffs at home Jan. 13 or 14 .
2007_01_01_1815832	19	If Grossman plays as poorly as he did in this game , however , the Bears are likely to exit the playoffs quickly , home field and bye notwithstanding . ''
2007_01_01_1815832	20	Everything that could go wrong went wrong , '' Grossman said . ''
2007_01_01_1815832	21	I 've been in this position before .
2007_01_01_1815832	22	I 'm going to go into my fort and fight my way out . ''
2007_01_01_1815832	23	At this point , it would be hard to believe that every player in the Bears ' locker room agrees with Coach Lovie Smith 's loyalty to Grossman .
2007_01_01_1815832	24	But it would also seem improbable that Smith would replace Grossman with Brian Griese for the playoffs , after hardly playing Griese all season .
2007_01_01_1815832	25	Smith said that he would not make a quarterback change and that , regardless of how Grossman was playing Sunday , he had planned to take him out of the game sometime during the third quarter . ''
2007_01_01_1815832	26	I did n't think there was any need to put him back in after an effort like that , '' Smith said .
2007_01_01_1815832	27	Asked if Grossman 's performance concerned him , Smith said , '' Our team 's performance concerns me . ''
2007_01_01_1815832	28	Griese struggled initially , playing the second half in place of Grossman , after Green Bay had built a 20-0 lead .
2007_01_01_1815832	29	But Griese took the field to cheers from the many fans who have turned on Grossman ; they cheered even louder late in the third quarter , when Griese hit Michael Bradley for a 75-yard touchdown pass .
2007_01_01_1815832	30	When Smith looks at videotape of this game , he will see a flustered starting quarterback .
2007_01_01_1815832	31	With Green Bay already leading by 7-0 , Nick Collins read Grossman perfectly , stepping in front of a short pass intended for tight end Desmond Clark .
2007_01_01_1815832	32	Once Collins intercepted the pass , he easily ran past Grossman for a 55-yard touchdown .
2007_01_01_1815832	33	From that point , Grossman 's mistakes snowballed .
2007_01_01_1815832	34	He fumbled on the next series , and Green Bay recovered .
2007_01_01_1815832	35	On the series after that , Grossman hurried a pass under pressure , and cornerback Charles Woodson stepped in for another interception .
2007_01_01_1815832	36	Late in the first half , a Grossman pass was tipped at the line of scrimmage by Corey Williams and intercepted by linebacker Patrick Dendy , who raced 30 yards for another touchdown .
2007_01_01_1815832	37	The Packers finished 8-8 , a solid start in the rebuilding plan of the first-year coach Mike McCarthy , who has said that he wants Favre to return .
2007_01_01_1815832	38	Favre led the Packers to a touchdown drive on their opening possession , whipping a pass to Donald Driver on a slant pattern for a 9-yard touchdown .
2007_01_01_1815832	39	It was Favre 's 414th career touchdown pass , and it might have been his last .
2007_01_01_1815832	40	But while Favre has time to make a decision , the Bears have less time to sort out their quarterback issues before the playoffs .
2007_01_01_1815835	0	Jordan W. Hess was the unlikeliest of soldiers .
2007_01_01_1815835	1	He could bench-press 300 pounds and then go home and write poetry .
2007_01_01_1815835	2	He learned the art of glass blowing because it seemed interesting and built a computer with only a magazine as his guide .
2007_01_01_1815835	3	Most recently , he fell in love with a woman from Brazil and took up digital photography , letting both sweep his heart away .
2007_01_01_1815835	4	Specialist Hess , the seventh of eight children , was never keen on premonitions , but on Christmas of 2005 , as his tight-knit family gathered on a beach for the weekend , he told each sibling and parent privately that he did not expect to come home from Iraq .
2007_01_01_1815835	5	On Nov. 11 , Specialist Hess , 26 , freshly arrived in Iraq , was conducting a mission as the driver of an Abrams tank when an improvised explosive device , or I.E.D. , blew up with brain-rattling force .
2007_01_01_1815835	6	The blast was so potent it penetrated the 67-ton tank , flinging him against the top and critically injuring his spine .
2007_01_01_1815835	7	His four crewmates survived .
2007_01_01_1815835	8	For three weeks , he hung on at Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio , long enough to utter a few words to his loved ones and absorb their kindness .
2007_01_01_1815835	9	On Dec. 4 , Specialist Hess slipped onto the ever-expanding list of American military fatalities in Iraq , one that has increased by an average of more than three a day since Oct. 1 , the highest three-month toll in two years .
2007_01_01_1815835	10	On Sunday , with the announcement of the death in Baghdad of Specialist Dustin R. Donica , 22 , of Spring , Tex. , the list reached the somber milestone of at least 3,000 deaths since the March 2003 invasion .
2007_01_01_1815835	11	The landmark reflects how much more dangerous and muddled a soldier 's job in Iraq has become in the face of a growing and increasingly sophisticated insurgency .
2007_01_01_1815835	12	Violence in the country is at an all-time high , according to a Pentagon report released last month .
2007_01_01_1815835	13	December was the third deadliest month for American troops since the start of the war , with insurgents claiming 111 soldiers ' lives .
2007_01_01_1815835	14	October and November also witnessed a high number of casualties , 106 and 68 respectively , as American forces stepped up combat operations to try to stabilize Baghdad . ''
2007_01_01_1815835	15	It escalated while I was there , '' said Capt. Scott Stanford , a National Guard officer who was a commander of a headquarters company in Ramadi for a year , arriving in June 2005 . ''
2007_01_01_1815835	16	When we left this June , it was completely unhinged .
2007_01_01_1815835	17	There was a huge increase in the suicide car bombs we had .
2007_01_01_1815835	18	The I.E.D. 's were bigger and more complex . '' ''
2007_01_01_1815835	19	And it was very tense before we left in terms of snipers , '' said Captain Stanford , a member of the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America . ''
2007_01_01_1815835	20	I do n't know if there were more of them , or if they were getting better . ''
2007_01_01_1815835	21	This spike in violence , which has been felt most profoundly by Iraqi civilians , who are dying by the thousands , has stoked feverish debate about the nation 's presence in Iraq .
2007_01_01_1815835	22	Many Democrats in Congress are urging a phased withdrawal from the country , and the Bush administration is leaning toward deploying additional troops in 2007 .
2007_01_01_1815835	23	If the conflict continues into March , the Iraq war will be the third longest in American history , ranked behind the Vietnam War and the American Revolution .
2007_01_01_1815835	24	President Bush did not specifically acknowledge reaching the milestone of 3,000 American deaths , but a White House spokesman , Scott Stanzel , said the president '' grieves for each one that is lost '' and would ensure that their sacrifices were not made in vain .
2007_01_01_1815835	25	The campaign against terrorism , Mr. Stanzel said , will be a long struggle .
2007_01_01_1815835	26	Specialist Hess had volunteered for his mission to spare another soldier the danger of going outside the wire that day .
2007_01_01_1815835	27	Like so many of his fallen comrades , he had become the victim of an inescapably dangerous roadside landscape . ''
2007_01_01_1815835	28	It was the type of injury you rarely recover from ; in past wars you would n't have gotten out of theater , '' said his father , Bill Hess , a Boeing engineer and retired Air Force man . ''
2007_01_01_1815835	29	So that was a blessing , that he could talk to us .
2007_01_01_1815835	30	He mouthed words and we were able to say we loved him .
2007_01_01_1815835	31	There is a lot to be said for that . ''
2007_01_01_1815835	32	A Steady Toll of Deaths In many ways , the third 1,000 men and women to die in Iraq faced the same unflinching challenge as the second 1,000 soldiers to die there -- a dedicated and ruthless Iraqi insurgency that has exploited the power of roadside bombs to chilling effect .
2007_01_01_1815835	33	These bombs now cause about half of all American combat deaths and injuries in Iraq .
2007_01_01_1815835	34	Over all , the casualty rate has remained relatively steady since 2005 , dipping only slightly .
2007_01_01_1815835	35	It took 14 months for the death toll to jump to 2,000 soldiers from 1,000 .
2007_01_01_1815835	36	It took about two weeks longer for it to rise to 3,000 from 2,000 , during the period covering Oct. 25 , 2005 , to this week . ''
2007_01_01_1815835	37	It is hugely frustrating , tragic and disappointing that we ca n't reduce the fatality rate , '' said Michael O'Hanlon , a military analyst for the Brookings Institution .
2007_01_01_1815835	38	The service members who died during this latest period fit an unchanging profile .
2007_01_01_1815835	39	They were mostly white men from rural areas , soldiers so young they still held fresh memories of high school football heroics and teenage escapades .
2007_01_01_1815835	40	Many men and women were in Iraq for the second or third time .
2007_01_01_1815835	41	Some were going on their fourth , fifth or sixth deployment .
2007_01_01_1815835	42	But in other ways , the situation has changed in the past year .
2007_01_01_1815835	43	Improvised explosive devices -- the kind that killed Specialist Hess -- have grown deadlier , despite concerted Pentagon efforts and billions of dollars spent trying to counteract them .
2007_01_01_1815835	44	Insurgents are now more adept at concealing bombs , booby-trapping them and powering them to penetrate well-armored vehicles .
2007_01_01_1815835	45	They are also scattering more of them along countless roads using myriad triggers and hiding spots -- under garbage and tires , behind guardrails , inside craters .
2007_01_01_1815835	46	At the same time , Iraqi citizens have grown less inclined to tip off soldiers to the presence of these bombs .
2007_01_01_1815835	47	About 1,200 roadside bombs were detonated in August .
2007_01_01_1815835	48	The toll of war has fallen most heavily this year on regular Army soldiers , at least 544 of whom died in this group of 1,000 , compared with 405 in the last group .
2007_01_01_1815835	49	This increase was the result of fewer National Guard soldiers and reservists being deployed to Iraq in 2006 .
2007_01_01_1815835	50	Considering the intensity of the violence in Iraq this year , it is remarkable that the casualty rate did not climb higher , analysts and officers say .
2007_01_01_1815835	51	Long-awaited improvements in body and vehicle armor have helped protect soldiers , and advances in battlefield medicine have saved many lives .
2007_01_01_1815835	52	New procedures , like leaving wounds open to prevent infection , and relaying soldiers to hospitals faster than ever , have kept more service members alive .
2007_01_01_1815835	53	Troops now carry their own tourniquets .
2007_01_01_1815835	54	During World War II , 30 percent of all wounded soldiers died of their injuries , a number that dipped to 24 percent during the Vietnam War and then to 9 percent for the Iraq conflict .
2007_01_01_1815835	55	Though this is a positive development , it also means that more soldiers are coming home with life-changing injuries , including amputations and brain trauma .
2007_01_01_1815835	56	More than 22,000 soldiers have been wounded in Iraq . ''
2007_01_01_1815835	57	There is no question that the number of dead should have been far higher , '' said Dr. William Winkenwerder , the assistant secretary of defense for health affairs , referring to the Iraqi conflict . ''
2007_01_01_1815835	58	Some of these blast injuries are very powerful . ''
2007_01_01_1815835	59	Bombs and bullets are not the only things that can kill soldiers ; nearly 20 percent of those who die in Iraq do so outside of combat operations .
2007_01_01_1815835	60	Sometimes it is the hazard of driving too quickly on badly rutted roads to avoid danger .
2007_01_01_1815835	61	Humvees , weighted down with armor , can easily flip if maneuvered too quickly .
2007_01_01_1815835	62	Many of Iraq 's roads are not built to hold heavy vehicles , and the ground can give way , tossing multi-ton machines into narrow canals where soldiers have drowned .
2007_01_01_1815835	63	Helicopters are sometimes strafed by sandstorms or crippled by mechanical malfunctions .
2007_01_01_1815835	64	Accidents make up two-thirds of the nonhostile deaths .
2007_01_01_1815835	65	With so many soldiers carrying so many weapons , unintentional casualties occur , sometimes while handling firearms .
2007_01_01_1815835	66	Fire from one 's own side is another inevitability of war , as is suicide .
2007_01_01_1815835	67	Since March 2003 , 93 soldiers have died from self-inflicted wounds in Iraq .
2007_01_01_1815835	68	In a way , these deaths , coming not at the hands of the enemy , but as a consequence of inferior roads and turbulent weather , can be even more difficult for parents to accept .
2007_01_01_1815835	69	Sometimes they wait months for official reports , since all noncombat deaths must be investigated . ''
2007_01_01_1815835	70	I do n't think I ever thought something like this could happen , '' said Shelley Burnett , whose son , Lance Cpl. Jason K. Burnett , 20 , died in May after his tank toppled into a canal . ''
2007_01_01_1815835	71	We talked a lot about the I.E.D. 's and the dangers out there , but Jason kept saying , ` There is not a whole lot they can do to a tank . ' ''
2007_01_01_1815835	72	Death at Roadside Over the last two years , the Pentagon has worked frantically to harden body armor and the armor on its Humvees and other vehicles .
2007_01_01_1815835	73	And the insurgents in Iraq have responded just as forcefully with deadly innovations in roadside bombs , and a fury of sniper bullets .
2007_01_01_1815835	74	The most lethal development is the use of the '' explosively formed penetrators , '' which pierce armor and stay intact when they explode .
2007_01_01_1815835	75	Roadside bombs are often detonated from a distance -- with garage door openers , for example -- or automatically , from pressure-sensitive devices , like a simple rubber air hose .
2007_01_01_1815835	76	Motion detectors and infrared devices are also used .
2007_01_01_1815835	77	The vast majority of these bombs do not kill soldiers , or even injure them seriously .
2007_01_01_1815835	78	Four out of five I.E.D. 's that detonate do not cause casualties , an improvement over previous years , the Pentagon says .
2007_01_01_1815835	79	But those devices that do cause casualties are killing more soldiers .
2007_01_01_1815835	80	An analysis by The New York Times of military records found that in 2003 , the devices accounted for 16 percent of troop fatalities .
2007_01_01_1815835	81	This year , they accounted for 43 percent .
2007_01_01_1815835	82	And an increasing number are killing more than one soldier . ''
2007_01_01_1815835	83	Unfortunately , when there is a fatal I.E.D. attack , there often are multiple wounded and casualties , '' said Christine DeVries , a spokeswoman for the Pentagon 's Joint I.E.D. Defeat Organization . ''
2007_01_01_1815835	84	The enemy has had some success in adapting to what we are doing . ''
2007_01_01_1815835	85	Lance Cpl. Jon Eric Bowman , 21 , affectionate and angel-faced , was typical of many of the soldiers and marines who found their calling in the military .
2007_01_01_1815835	86	He was raised in rural Dubach , La. , far from the razzmatazz of New Orleans , and could not wait to join after the Sept. 11 attacks .
2007_01_01_1815835	87	He was first sent to Iraq early in 2005 .
2007_01_01_1815835	88	When he came home later that year , he had changed .
2007_01_01_1815835	89	Three days before he was set to redeploy this September , he sat with his wife in their truck and talked for six hours . ''
2007_01_01_1815835	90	He was crying , he was so scared , '' said his wife , Dawn Bowman , 26 . ''
2007_01_01_1815835	91	He was having dreams that he was n't coming back . ''
2007_01_01_1815835	92	In fact , Corporal Bowman had been having blackouts , migraines and a tic , new ailments from his time in Iraq , his wife said .
2007_01_01_1815835	93	The diagnosis was Tourette 's syndrome , and he was then told by doctors in in Louisiana that fluid had built up in his brain .
2007_01_01_1815835	94	He wound up back in Iraq , anyway . ''
2007_01_01_1815835	95	They felt he was just trying to get out of Iraq , '' said Johnny Bowman , the corporal 's father , of his son 's superiors . ''
2007_01_01_1815835	96	That there was really nothing wrong with him .
2007_01_01_1815835	97	That 's what he told me on the phone . ''
2007_01_01_1815835	98	Corporal Bowman did not push the issue , feeling guilty about abandoning his fellow marines .
2007_01_01_1815835	99	On Oct. 9 , his Humvee ran across a roadside bomb , killing him instantly .
2007_01_01_1815835	100	He had been manning the machine gun . ''
2007_01_01_1815835	101	Jon Eric was not just my only son , '' his father said . ''
2007_01_01_1815835	102	He was my best friend . ''
2007_01_01_1815835	103	Lance Cpl. Jeromy D. West , 20 , a mortar man who loved to fish as much as he hated to study , was killed on Nov. 25 by a sniper bullet as he stood guard on a roof in Haditha .
2007_01_01_1815835	104	It was his second deployment .
2007_01_01_1815835	105	In December , shortly after word of his death , his family honored his wishes and held a memorial for him on the football field at Hamilton High School , near San Diego , where he had been a star player .
2007_01_01_1815835	106	A thousand people showed up . ''
2007_01_01_1815835	107	Everybody liked him , '' his stepfather , Ron Klopf , said . ''
2007_01_01_1815835	108	People would say , ` God , your son is polite . '
2007_01_01_1815835	109	And I would say , ` My kid ? '
2007_01_01_1815835	110	I called him Eddie Haskell -- so polite at everybody else 's house . ''
2007_01_01_1815835	111	Corporal West was goofy in the best way .
2007_01_01_1815835	112	Not long before he joined the Marines , he and his friend would compete to see who could get a bigger freeze headache from eating too much ice cream .
2007_01_01_1815835	113	They would writhe in pain .
2007_01_01_1815835	114	Then they would do it again .
2007_01_01_1815835	115	He was 17 when he decided to get serious and join the corps , something his parents tried to talk him out of . ''
2007_01_01_1815835	116	` You can get killed doing this , ' '' Mr. Klopf remembers saying . ''
2007_01_01_1815835	117	And he said , ` Should we send some other parent 's kid out there ? '
2007_01_01_1815835	118	And that 's how he was . ''
2007_01_01_1815835	119	For Corporal Burnett , death came not from bullets or bombs but from riding in a tank in a country crisscrossed with irrigation canals and crumbly roads .
2007_01_01_1815835	120	Just two years after graduating from high school in St. Cloud , Fla. , where he spent his summers building houses for the poor and four-wheeling on back-country roads , Corporal Burnett 's tank fell off a bridge and plunged into a canal , in which he drowned .
2007_01_01_1815835	121	His mother can not forget the day Jason and his younger brother tossed her back and forth in the yard to make her scream with laughter . ''
2007_01_01_1815835	122	He was a fun-loving kid , '' Mrs. Burnett said . ''
2007_01_01_1815835	123	If you heard laughter , you knew Jason was around . ''
2007_01_01_1815835	124	Optimism was Specialist Robert F. Weber 's indelible quality .
2007_01_01_1815835	125	A gunner from Cincinnati , he had warned his mother , Cathy , that the roads in Iraq were wretched .
2007_01_01_1815835	126	She worried a lot during his first deployment , particularly after he sent home a roll of film to develop .
2007_01_01_1815835	127	The first print she saw was of a missile hitting a barracks .
2007_01_01_1815835	128	But he made it back to America and bought a blue Kia , the color of his eyes , before redeploying three weeks later .
2007_01_01_1815835	129	The Army had been a good fit . ''
2007_01_01_1815835	130	He was proud of himself , '' she said of Bobby , her only child . ''
2007_01_01_1815835	131	I was very proud .
2007_01_01_1815835	132	It was like he found his niche . ''
2007_01_01_1815835	133	On his second deployment , though , the situation in Iraq had become grimmer . ''
2007_01_01_1815835	134	Mom , things are getting worse over here , more dangerous , '' he said , from his base near Mosul the Saturday before he died . ''
2007_01_01_1815835	135	The roads are bad .
2007_01_01_1815835	136	You do n't run over anything even if it looks like a piece of paper . ''
2007_01_01_1815835	137	But the lumbering armored Humvee he was on never hit a bomb on Sept. 30 .
2007_01_01_1815835	138	It swerved somehow and flipped , killing him .
2007_01_01_1815835	139	Mrs. Weber said she can not imagine seeing the troops walk away from Iraq now , when democracy seems as unattainable as ever . ''
2007_01_01_1815835	140	For what did all these guys get killed over there ? ''
2007_01_01_1815835	141	she asked , incredulously . ''
2007_01_01_1815835	142	Seven Days from Home Back in America , countless families and friends have waited and worried and tried their best these past years to keep themselves busy until their husbands , sons , wives , daughters , fathers , mothers or buddies returned home safely .
2007_01_01_1815835	143	For 3,000 of them , the reunion never came .
2007_01_01_1815835	144	In too many cases , the homecoming was tantalizingly near , a few more X 's on the calendar and the vigil would be over .
2007_01_01_1815835	145	A number of soldiers were killed just days and weeks from the end of their deployment , a date close enough to allow those back home to lower their guard a trifle , making the deaths all the more devastating . ''
2007_01_01_1815835	146	It 's almost like Christmas is here , and you wake up Christmas morning and there is no Christmas , '' said Col. Bill Rochelle , a retired National Guard commander of the 42nd Division support command .
2007_01_01_1815835	147	Gunnery Sgt. John D. Fry , a 28-year-old marine from Lorena , Tex. , was seven days from scooping up his wife , Malia , and his three kids into a group hug back in America . ''
2007_01_01_1815835	148	My plans , '' Sergeant Fry told his commander , '' are to go home and wrestle with my kids . ''
2007_01_01_1815835	149	He and Mrs. Fry were only 15 when they went on their first date , to see '' A League of Their Own , '' and then to eat ice cream at the mall .
2007_01_01_1815835	150	Mom and Dad drove them home .
2007_01_01_1815835	151	A year later , he plopped her on his lap and proposed .
2007_01_01_1815835	152	They kept their engagement a secret .
2007_01_01_1815835	153	Not long after , he was named salutatorian at Heritage Christian Academy .
2007_01_01_1815835	154	Another student bested him for the top title ; it was the future Mrs. Fry , the valedictorian . ''
2007_01_01_1815835	155	We were soul mates , '' Mrs. Fry said .
2007_01_01_1815835	156	On Nov. 15 , 1995 , five days after he graduated from boot camp , they were married .
2007_01_01_1815835	157	Mr. Fry , who liked a challenge , specialized in defusing explosive devices , a nerve-racking skill he brought with him to Iraq . ''
2007_01_01_1815835	158	Babe , '' Mrs. Fry recalled his saying when he chose the specialty , '' it 's dangerous , but I want to do it .
2007_01_01_1815835	159	And I said , ` Let 's go . ' ''
2007_01_01_1815835	160	A team leader , Sergeant Fry , who shipped out to Iraq in September 2005 , disarmed 73 bombs , including one of the biggest car bombs found in Falluja .
2007_01_01_1815835	161	Once he helped defuse a suicide vest that insurgents had belted to a mentally handicapped Iraqi teenage boy .
2007_01_01_1815835	162	The boy had been beaten and chained to a wall .
2007_01_01_1815835	163	Another time , he spotted a bomb from the roof of a house .
2007_01_01_1815835	164	A little boy popped into the yard , hovering dangerously close to it .
2007_01_01_1815835	165	Sergeant Fry won his confidence by playing peekaboo , then got him to move away .
2007_01_01_1815835	166	He was in '' very high spirits '' in March , calling his wife to say that his duties were done , his paperwork filed and his anticipation impossible to stifle . ''
2007_01_01_1815835	167	He had made it , '' she said .
2007_01_01_1815835	168	Then a mission came down , and commanders were preparing to send a team of mostly inexperienced men to defuse bombs along a road in Al Anbar province .
2007_01_01_1815835	169	He volunteered for the job , instead . ''
2007_01_01_1815835	170	That is how he led , '' Mrs. Fry said .
2007_01_01_1815835	171	Sergeant Fry found three bombs that night and defused them .
2007_01_01_1815835	172	But the insurgents had hidden a fourth bomb under the third one , a booby-trap .
2007_01_01_1815835	173	It blew up and killed him .
2007_01_01_1815835	174	An Army team stayed with his body for six hours , fending off enemy fire in the dark until soldiers with mortuary affairs arrived to take his body away .
2007_01_01_1815835	175	The war never scared him , Mrs. Fry said . ''
2007_01_01_1815835	176	It was hard , but he felt he was making a difference , '' she said . ''
2007_01_01_1815835	177	He believed truly , that if he was n't over there , they would be trying to harm us here . ''
2007_01_01_1815835	178	Estimates of Iraqi Civilian Deaths Unlike the tally for American service members , no official count is available for the number of civilians killed in Iraq .
2007_01_01_1815835	179	Estimates based on mortuary tallies , news reports and household surveys vary widely .
2007_01_01_1815835	180	Using figures provided by the Iraq Ministry of Health , which counts violent deaths at hospitals across the country , and Baghdad 's central morgue , the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq has estimated that more than 28,000 Iraqi civilians were killed during the first 10 months of 2006 , a number 40 times higher than the number of American service members killed during that time .
2007_01_01_1815835	181	The American military has criticized the civilian count as high , but it has not released statistics of its own .
2007_01_01_1815835	182	In its quarterly reports to Congress , the Pentagon has provided a rough estimate of the number of Iraqi civilians and security forces killed or wounded by insurgents .
2007_01_01_1815835	183	That number has risen sharply , to an average of more than 90 a day since last May .
2007_01_01_1815835	184	In an off-the-cuff estimate during an official visit to Vienna in November , Iraq 's health minister , Ali al-Shimari , said that 150,000 Iraqis had been killed in violence since the war began in 2003 , the Associated Press has reported .
2007_01_01_1815835	185	Iraq Body Count , an independent group that monitors news reports of deaths , has recorded the deaths of more than 52,000 Iraqi civilians .
2007_01_01_1815835	186	The highest estimates of the civilian toll come from a team of researchers from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health .
2007_01_01_1815835	187	In a study published in The Lancet , a British medical journal , they estimated 600,000 Iraqis died from violence between March 2003 and July 2006 , basing their analysis on a survey of 1,849 households in 47 neighborhoods across Iraq .
2007_01_01_1815835	188	That study was widely criticized -- the sample interviewed may not accurately represent the entire country -- but it emphasized both the difficulty of tracking deaths in a war zone and the need for a reliable count .

Hess .
2007_01_01_1815835	190	There were three , not four .
2007_01_01_1815837	0	The Democrats taking over Congress this week are promising sweeping changes to ethics and lobbying laws , pledging to clean up after a spate of corruption scandals under Republican rules .
2007_01_01_1815837	1	So far , however , their proposals are not as comprehensive or far-reaching as changes already adopted by many state legislatures .
2007_01_01_1815837	2	Democrats in both chambers are proposing new restrictions on gifts , meals or trips paid for by lobbyists .
2007_01_01_1815837	3	They say they plan for the first time to require lawmakers to disclose their sponsorship of the pet items known as earmarks that they insert into major bills .
2007_01_01_1815837	4	House Democrats also want to require members to certify that they will not personally profit from the projects .
2007_01_01_1815837	5	Several states , responding to the federal scandals as well as their own statehouse imbroglios , have already adopted more sweeping gift and travel bans , broader measures to end the central role of lobbyists or government contractors in financing campaigns and new public campaign financing intended to reduce lawmakers ' dependence on big donors .
2007_01_01_1815837	6	To enforce their rules , about half the states have also created independent ethics watchdogs , outside the control of the lawmakers they police -- something federal lawmakers have so far resisted .
2007_01_01_1815837	7	House Democrats recently said they would create a panel to study the idea .
2007_01_01_1815837	8	John Hurson , a former member of the Maryland General Assembly and president of the National Council of State Legislatures , remembers marveling at the goings-on just a few miles away in the United States Capitol .
2007_01_01_1815837	9	He was barred from letting a lobbyist buy him a cup of coffee under rules enforced by the Maryland Ethics Commission .
2007_01_01_1815837	10	Meanwhile , congressmen were flying across the country for golf trips with lobbyists and enlisting them as major fund-raisers for their re-election campaigns . ''
2007_01_01_1815837	11	It was amusing in a sad kind of way , '' said Mr. Hurson , who now works as a Washington lobbyist himself , for a cosmetics industry trade group . ''
2007_01_01_1815837	12	At the state level in Maryland a lobbyist ca n't even have his name on a campaign flier .
2007_01_01_1815837	13	And at the federal level some of these guys are basically running campaigns . ''
2007_01_01_1815837	14	Democrats say their proposals are significant first steps , especially given the customary opposition of most incumbents toward rules that would restrict their fund-raising edge .
2007_01_01_1815837	15	The Democrats argue that their proposals go further than anything Republicans managed to pass . ''
2007_01_01_1815837	16	It is an important step forward from where we have been , let 's put it that way , '' said Representative Chris Van Hollen , the Maryland Democrat who is taking over the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and is a proponent of several more drastic changes .
2007_01_01_1815837	17	Still , some Democrats say they hope the Congress will go beyond the party leaders ' current proposals .
2007_01_01_1815837	18	They argue that their party took control of Congress in part because of backlash against the corruption scandals under the Republicans , that many new members campaigned on ethics reform and that a failure to deliver meaningful changes could hurt the party in the 2008 elections .
2007_01_01_1815837	19	Lawmakers say the Supreme Court made it difficult to regulate campaign spending by ruling in 1976 , in Buckley v. Valeo , that it is a protected form of free expression .
2007_01_01_1815837	20	States , however , are testing the limits of that decision .
2007_01_01_1815837	21	More than a dozen states , including New Jersey and Connecticut , have enacted so-called pay-to-play laws that block contractors or executives of their companies from making campaign contributions to officials who could influence state contracts .
2007_01_01_1815837	22	Connecticut , reeling from a payoff scandal that unseated its governor , recently passed a pay-to-play law that takes aim at a time-tested tactic for evading contribution limits : funneling money through dependents .
2007_01_01_1815837	23	The law bans campaign contributions not only from lobbyists and contracting executives but also from their children and spouses .
2007_01_01_1815837	24	To make enforcement easier , lobbyists and contractors would be required to disclose the names of their family members on a public Web site .
2007_01_01_1815837	25	( No Congressional proposal does the same . )
2007_01_01_1815837	26	On Tuesday , a federal district court judge in Connecticut will hear a challenge to the law .
2007_01_01_1815837	27	Connecticut has also borrowed some aspects of a decade-old Maryland law that seeks to restrict the most valuable gift that lobbyists give lawmakers : campaign fund-raising .
2007_01_01_1815837	28	At the federal level , caps on individual or corporate campaign contributions have placed a premium on '' bundlers , '' who solicit and collect donations to turn over in bulk to a candidate 's campaign .
2007_01_01_1815837	29	Many Washington lobbyists are among the biggest bundlers , and even help run re-election campaigns .
2007_01_01_1815837	30	Across the District of Columbia border in Maryland , state law bars lobbyists from soliciting contributions for candidates or playing any roles in the campaigns . ''
2007_01_01_1815837	31	Lobbyists can no longer be the center of the fund-raising process , '' Mr. Van Hollen of Maryland said .
2007_01_01_1815837	32	Mr. Van Hollen said he planned to introduce a measure requiring federal lobbyists to disclose whom they ask for the contributions that they bundle and how much those people give .
2007_01_01_1815837	33	A similar measure was deleted from a bill by the Republican leadership before it reached the floor .
2007_01_01_1815837	34	States are also adopting new forms of public campaign financing .
2007_01_01_1815837	35	Congressional candidates receive no public financing , and there is no limit on what they can spend .
2007_01_01_1815837	36	And the public financing system adopted for presidential campaigns after the Watergate scandal is on the brink of obsolescence .
2007_01_01_1815837	37	For the first time in three decades , the major 2008 presidential candidates are expected to reject the system in favor of raising unlimited private funds .
2007_01_01_1815837	38	Several states , however , are expanding the idea .
2007_01_01_1815837	39	Maryland and New Jersey are among those considering a system enacted in Arizona and Maine .
2007_01_01_1815837	40	The new Connecticut law includes a modified form of the idea , known as '' clean elections . ''
2007_01_01_1815837	41	Participating candidates who get a certain amount of small contributions -- as low as $ 5 in some places -- receive large lump sums of public campaign money early in the race if they agree not to raise or spend private funds .
2007_01_01_1815837	42	And , up to a limit , the state pledges to give participating candidates enough money to match the campaign spending of any rival candidate outside the system .
2007_01_01_1815837	43	No state , of course , has eradicated the influence of money .
2007_01_01_1815837	44	In Maryland , for example , lobbyists can not take individual lawmakers to dinner but can treat whole legislative committees , a rule lobbyists say favors the well-financed .
2007_01_01_1815837	45	Even so , some Annapolis lobbyists appreciate the fund-raising ban . ''
2007_01_01_1815837	46	Legislators can call and say they need your help , '' said Minor Carter , a Republican lobbyist . ''
2007_01_01_1815837	47	And you have the absolute defense of saying , ` I 'm sorry , I ca n't . ' ''
2007_01_01_1815838	0	With his plain pine coffin strapped into an American military helicopter for a predawn journey across the desert , Saddam Hussein , the executed dictator who built a legend with his defiance of America , completed a turbulent passage into history on Sunday .
2007_01_01_1815838	1	Like the helicopter trip , just about everything in the 24 hours that began with Mr. Hussein 's being taken to his execution from his cell in an American military detention center in the postmidnight chill of Saturday had a surreal and even cinematic quality .
2007_01_01_1815838	2	Part of it was that the Americans , who turned him into a pariah and drove him from power , proved to be his unlikely benefactors in the face of Iraq 's new Shiite rulers who seemed bent on turning the execution and its aftermath into a new nightmare for the Sunni minority privileged under Mr. Hussein .
2007_01_01_1815838	3	[ Page A7 . ]
2007_01_01_1815838	4	The 110-mile journey aboard a Black Hawk helicopter carried Mr. Hussein 's body to an American military base north of Tikrit , Camp Speicher , named for an American Navy pilot lost over Iraq in the first hours of the Persian Gulf war in 1991 .
2007_01_01_1815838	5	From there , an Iraqi convoy carried him to Awja , the humble town beside the Tigris River that Mr. Hussein , in the chandeliered palaces that became his habitat as ruler , spoke of as emblematic of the miseries of his lonely and impoverished youth .
2007_01_01_1815838	6	The American role extended beyond providing the helicopter that carried Mr. Hussein home .
2007_01_01_1815838	7	Iraqi and American officials who have discussed the intrigue and confusion that preceded the decision late on Friday to rush Mr. Hussein to the gallows have said that it was the Americans who questioned the political wisdom -- and justice -- of expediting the execution , in ways that required Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki to override constitutional and religious precepts that might have assured Mr. Hussein a more dignified passage to his end .
2007_01_01_1815838	8	The Americans ' concerns seem certain to have been heightened by what happened at the hanging , as evidenced in video recordings made just before Mr. Hussein fell through the gallows trapdoor at 6:10 a.m. on Saturday .
2007_01_01_1815838	9	A new video that appeared on the Internet late Saturday , apparently made by a witness with a camera cellphone , underscored the unruly , mocking atmosphere in the execution chamber .
2007_01_01_1815838	10	This continued , on the video , through the actual hanging itself , with a shout of '' The tyrant has fallen !
2007_01_01_1815838	11	May God curse him ! ''
2007_01_01_1815838	12	as Mr. Hussein hung lifeless , his neck snapped back and his glassy eyes open .
2007_01_01_1815838	13	The cacophony from those gathered before the gallows included a shout of '' Go to hell ! ''
2007_01_01_1815838	14	as the former ruler stood with the noose around his neck in the final moments , and his riposte , barely audible above the bedlam , which included the words '' gallows of shame . ''
2007_01_01_1815838	15	It continued despite appeals from an official-sounding voice , possibly Munir Haddad , the judge who presided at the hanging , saying , '' Please no !
2007_01_01_1815838	16	The man is about to die . ''
2007_01_01_1815838	17	The Shiites who predominated at the hanging began a refrain at one point of '' Moktada !
2007_01_01_1815838	18	-- the name of a volatile cleric whose private militia has spawned death squads that have made an indiscriminate industry of killing Sunnis -- appending it to a Muslim imprecation for blessings on the Prophet Muhammad . ''
2007_01_01_1815838	19	Moktada , '' Mr. Hussein replied , smiling contemptuously . ''
2007_01_01_1815838	20	Is this how real men behave ? ''
2007_01_01_1815838	21	American officials in Iraq have been reluctant to say much publicly about the pell-mell nature of the hanging , apparently fearful of provoking recriminations in Washington , where the Bush administration adopted a hands-off posture , saying the timing of the execution was Iraq 's to decide .
2007_01_01_1815838	22	While privately incensed at the dead-of-night rush to the gallows , the Americans here have been caught in the double bind that has ensnared them over much else about the Maliki government -- frustrated at what they call the government 's failure to recognize its destructive behavior , but reluctant to speak out , or sometimes to act , for fear of undermining Mr. Maliki and worsening the situation .
2007_01_01_1815838	23	But a narrative assembled from accounts by various American officials , and by Iraqis present at some of the crucial meetings between the two sides , shows that it was the Americans who counseled caution in the way the Iraqis carried out the hanging .
2007_01_01_1815838	24	The issues uppermost in the Americans ' minds , these officials said , were a provision in Iraq 's new Constitution that required the three-man presidency council to approve hangings , and a stipulation in a longstanding Iraqi law that no executions can be carried out during the Id al-Adha holiday , which began for Iraqi Sunnis on Saturday and Shiites on Sunday .
2007_01_01_1815838	25	A senior Iraqi official said the Americans staked out their ground at a meeting on Thursday , 48 hours after an appeals court had upheld the death sentence passed on Mr. Hussein and two associates .
2007_01_01_1815838	26	They were convicted in November of crimes against humanity for the persecution of the Shiite townspeople of Dujail , north of Baghdad , in 1982 .
2007_01_01_1815838	27	Mr. Hussein , as president , signed a decree to hang 148 men and teenage boys .
2007_01_01_1815838	28	Told that Mr. Maliki wanted to carry out the death sentence on Mr. Hussein almost immediately , and not wait further into the 30-day deadline set by the appeals court , American officers at the Thursday meeting said that they would accept any decision but needed assurance that due process had been followed before relinquishing physical custody of Mr. Hussein . ''
2007_01_01_1815838	29	The Americans said that we have no issue in handing him over , but we need everything to be in accordance with the law , '' the Iraqi official said . ''
2007_01_01_1815838	30	We do not want to break the law . ''
2007_01_01_1815838	31	The American pressure sent Mr. Maliki and his aides into a frantic quest for legal workarounds , the Iraqi official said .
2007_01_01_1815838	32	The Americans told them they needed a decree from President Jalal Talabani , signed jointly by his two vice presidents , upholding the death sentence , and a letter from the chief judge of the Iraqi High Tribunal , the court that tried Mr. Hussein , certifying the verdict .
2007_01_01_1815838	33	But Mr. Talabani , a Kurd , made it known that he objected to the death penalty on principle .
2007_01_01_1815838	34	The Maliki government spent much of Friday working on legal mechanisms to meet the American demands .
2007_01_01_1815838	35	From Mr. Talabani , they obtained a letter saying that while he would not sign a decree approving the hanging , he had no objections .
2007_01_01_1815838	36	The Iraqi official said Mr. Talabani first asked the tribunal 's judges for an opinion on whether the constitutional requirement for presidential approval applied to a death sentence handed down by the tribunal , a special court operating outside Iraq 's main judicial system .
2007_01_01_1815838	37	The judges said the requirement was void .
2007_01_01_1815838	38	Mr. Maliki had one major obstacle : the Hussein-era law proscribing executions during the Id holiday .
2007_01_01_1815838	39	This remained unresolved until late Friday , the Iraqi official said .
2007_01_01_1815838	40	He said he attended a late-night dinner at the prime minister 's office at which American officers and Mr. Maliki 's officials debated the issue .
2007_01_01_1815838	41	One participant described the meeting this way : '' The Iraqis seemed quite frustrated , saying , ` Who is going to execute him , anyway , you or us ? '
2007_01_01_1815838	42	The Americans replied by saying that obviously , it was the Iraqis who would carry out the hanging .
2007_01_01_1815838	43	So the Iraqis said , ` This is our problem and we will handle the consequences .
2007_01_01_1815838	44	If there is any damage done , it is we who will be damaged , not you . ' ''
2007_01_01_1815838	45	To this , the Iraqis added what has often been their trump card in tricky political situations : they telephoned officials of the marjaiya , thesupreme religious body in Iraqi Shiism , composed of ayatollahs in the holy city of Najaf .
2007_01_01_1815838	46	Mr. Maliki , at a few minutes before midnight on Friday , then signed a letter to the justice minister , '' to carry out the hanging until death . ''
2007_01_01_1815838	47	The Maliki letter sent Iraqi and American officials into a frenzy of activity .
2007_01_01_1815838	48	Fourteen Iraqi officials , including senior members of the Maliki government , were called at 1:30 a.m. on Saturday and told to gather at the prime minister 's office .
2007_01_01_1815838	49	3:30 a.m. , they were driven to the helicopter pad beside Mr. Hussein 's old Republican Palace , and taken to the prison in the northern suburb of Khadimiya where the hanging took place .
2007_01_01_1815838	50	At about the same time , American and Iraqi officials said , Mr. Hussein was roused at his Camp Cropper cell 10 miles away , and taken to a Black Hawk helicopter for his journey to Khadimiya .
2007_01_01_1815838	51	None of the Iraqi officials were able to explain why Mr. Maliki had been unwilling to allow the execution to wait .
2007_01_01_1815838	52	Nor would any explain why those who conducted it had allowed it to deteriorate into a sectarian free-for-all that had the effect , on the video recordings , of making Mr. Hussein , a mass murderer , appear dignified and restrained , and his executioners , representing Shiites who were his principal victims , seem like bullying street thugs .
2007_01_01_1815838	53	But the explanation may have lain in something that Bassam al-Husseini , a Maliki aide closely involved in arrangements for the hanging , said to the BBC later .
2007_01_01_1815838	54	Mr. Husseini , who has American citizenship , described the hanging as '' an Id gift to the Iraqi people . ''
2007_01_01_1815838	55	The weekend 's final disorderly chapter came with the tensions over Mr. Hussein 's body .
2007_01_01_1815838	56	For nearly 18 hours on Saturday , Mr. Maliki 's officials insisted that his corpse would be kept in secret government custody until circumstances allowed interment without his grave becoming a shrine or a target .
2007_01_01_1815838	57	Once again , the Americans intervened .
2007_01_01_1815838	58	The leader of Mr. Hussein 's Albu-Nasir tribe , Sheik Ali al-Nida , said that before flying to Baghdad on an American helicopter , he had been so fearful for his safety that he had written a will .
2007_01_01_1815838	59	Bizarrely , Sheik Nida and others were shown on Iraqi television collecting the coffin from the courtyard in front of Mr. Maliki 's office , where it sat unceremoniously in a police pickup .
2007_01_01_1815838	60	After the helicopter trip to Camp Speicher , the American base outside Tikrit , the coffin was taken in an Iraqi convoy to Awja , and laid to rest in the ornate visitors ' center that Mr. Hussein ordered built for the townspeople in the 1990s .
2007_01_01_1815838	61	Local officials and members of Mr. Hussein 's tribe had broken open the marbled floor in the main reception hall , and cleared what they said would be a temporary burial place until he could be moved to a permanent grave outside Awja where his two sons , Uday and Qusay , are buried .
2007_01_01_1815838	62	At the burial , several mourners threw themselves on the closed casket .
2007_01_01_1815838	63	One , a young man convulsed with sobs , cried : '' He has not died .
2007_01_01_1815838	64	I can hear him speaking to me . ''
2007_01_01_1815838	65	Another shouted , '' Saddam is dead !
2007_01_01_1815838	66	Instead of weeping for him , think of ways we can take revenge on the Iranian enemy , '' Sunni parlance for the Shiites now in power .
2007_01_01_1815839	0	It may fall short of a feel-good sequel to '' Chinatown , '' the movie based on the notorious , somewhat shady water grab by Los Angeles that allowed the city to bloom from a semi-arid desert .
2007_01_01_1815839	1	But in one of the largest river restoration efforts in the West , water is again flowing along a 62-mile stretch of the Owens River after a dry spell of nearly a century .
2007_01_01_1815839	2	That part of the river had been left mostly drained when upstream water , fed by snowmelt from the towering Sierra Nevada , was channeled 233 miles south to fill swimming pools and bathtubs throughout Los Angeles .
2007_01_01_1815839	3	The restored flow is among several long-awaited steps the city is taking to help make amends for the environmental consequences of its water maneuvering , most notably the drying up of Owens Lake , an area more than three times the size of Manhattan , here in the Owens Valley .
2007_01_01_1815839	4	Los Angeles agreed in December to expand efforts to control toxic dust storms that erupt from what is left of the lake , a 110-square-mile body that emptied when the river was diverted to Los Angeles through an aqueduct opened in 1913 .
2007_01_01_1815839	5	The lake 's salty , mineral-laced basin has been the largest single source of particulate pollution in the country .
2007_01_01_1815839	6	It looks so otherworldly that it doubled as a desolate planet in the movie '' Star Trek V : The Final Frontier . ''
2007_01_01_1815839	7	To restore the river , Los Angeles built automated gates at the point where the river veers into the aqueduct .
2007_01_01_1815839	8	The gates steer some water into the original riverbed , setting the stage for the growth of cottonwood trees and other plants and the return of waterfowl and other animals .
2007_01_01_1815839	9	Much of the water eventually returns to the aqueduct , though some of it is being used for lake irrigation and other projects .
2007_01_01_1815839	10	Environmentalists here say they are keeping an eye on Los Angeles for backsliding , but they acknowledge that the new efforts will make a significant difference .
2007_01_01_1815839	11	As winds whipped across Owens Lake on a recent afternoon , Mike Prather of the Owens Valley Committee , which along with the Sierra Club took Los Angeles to court over the environmental fallout of its water policies , marveled at sandpipers , American avocets and other birds frolicking in the shallow pools created by the irrigation . ''
2007_01_01_1815839	12	This work will bring back more and more of them , '' Mr. Prather said , savoring the twist in the battle that means water once intended for Los Angeles will feed the lake . ''
2007_01_01_1815839	13	It 's Owens Valley 's turn to stick its straw in L.A. 's water , '' he said .
2007_01_01_1815839	14	Court rulings and the threat of legal action have largely forced Los Angeles 's hand in dealing with its past water moves , but city leaders say they are also intent on doing the right thing in keeping up a vital source of water while avoiding further damage to the Owens Valley .
2007_01_01_1815839	15	H. David Nahai , president of the board that oversees the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power , said Los Angeles was looking for less adversarial ways to resolve differences over the valley , which provides 40 percent to 60 percent of the city 's water supply , depending on the snowfall in the mountains . ''
2007_01_01_1815839	16	We ca n't change the past , but we can shape the future , '' said Mr. Nahai , one of five board members appointed by Mayor Antonio R. Villaraigosa , who promised a friendlier approach to the valley when he took office in July 2005 .
2007_01_01_1815839	17	Susan Cash , the chairwoman of the Board of Supervisors of Inyo County , where the Owens Valley is located , said animosity toward Los Angeles had lessened since the early 20th century , when the water diversion was made possible by the purchase of much of the valley by less-than-forthcoming city operatives .
2007_01_01_1815839	18	The underhanded moves , as chronicled by historians , included city representatives posing as ranchers as they bought up property .
2007_01_01_1815839	19	The questionable land dealing provided the inspiration for '' Chinatown , '' the 1974 movie starring Jack Nicholson as a private detective who stumbles across corruption on a Los Angeles water project .
2007_01_01_1815839	20	Water from the valley made possible the growth of what became the nation 's second-largest city .
2007_01_01_1815839	21	But people in the valley have long regarded the water dealings as a double-edged sword .
2007_01_01_1815839	22	Officials here have argued that the water diversion undercut the potential for growth .
2007_01_01_1815839	23	But others say that such prospects were dim anyway in such a dry and remote valley , and that Los Angeles 's keeping the water clean and the land relatively untouched has been a boon .
2007_01_01_1815839	24	Los Angeles 's policy of allowing public access to much of its land and the fact that many people here have worked for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power , one of the valley 's largest employers , or have friends or relatives there , have contributed to improved relations .
2007_01_01_1815839	25	The godfathers of Ms. Cash 's children worked for the department . ''
2007_01_01_1815839	26	The fact is , '' she said , '' we are in a marriage with no annulment in the near future , so we have to find a way to work together . ''
2007_01_01_1815839	27	Inyo officials said the city 's projects could inspire more tourism , the only real economic activity in this dry , high-desert valley . ''
2007_01_01_1815839	28	We have recreational users now but not to the extent it can be once the river is flowing and there is sufficient water for fish and wildlife , '' said Arlene Grider , president of the chamber of commerce here .
2007_01_01_1815839	29	The long-promised river restoration is a $ 24 million project , compensation won from a lawsuit by environmental groups over excessive groundwater pumping .
2007_01_01_1815839	30	It came after delays that prompted a county judge in September 2005 to impose daily fines of $ 5,000 on Los Angeles .
2007_01_01_1815839	31	The penalty has so far cost the city $ 2.3 million and will continue until a large volume of water flows through the river in the coming months .
2007_01_01_1815839	32	The work on the lake , scheduled to be completed by 2010 , will irrigate or otherwise control dust over 43 square miles .
2007_01_01_1815839	33	The improvements result from an agreement the city signed with the local air pollution control regulator in 1998 that sets a timetable to comply with federal requirements to control dust on the lake .
2007_01_01_1815839	34	The city has spent $ 400 million on dust control for just under 30 square miles of the worst pockets , and in December , through a mediator , it agreed to do 12.7 more square miles by 2010 at a cost of $ 105 million .
2007_01_01_1815839	35	A water department spokeswoman in Los Angeles , Carol Tucker , said ratepayers would see relatively modest increases in their monthly bills ; the river restoration , for example , would amount to an increase of about 26 cents .
2007_01_01_1815839	36	Los Angeles has one of the country 's more intensive conservation programs , allowing it to use roughly the same amount of water even as it has grown by 750,000 residents in the past two decades .
2007_01_01_1815839	37	But environmentalists say they doubt the city can grow much more without finding more water .
2007_01_01_1815839	38	Mr. Nahai said the Department of Water and Power was already studying other possibilities , like using groundwater from within Los Angeles , buying water from other places and desalinating ocean water .
2007_01_01_1815839	39	But one thing is certain , he said : '' Are we going to get to a place where we are going to pump all the water out ?
2007_01_01_1815839	40	Still , most everyone suggests there could be rough going ahead .
2007_01_01_1815839	41	Ms. Cash , the Inyo County supervisor , said officials were only '' cautiously optimistic '' about a changed relationship with Los Angeles because they had heard nice words from the city before , only to end up in court .
2007_01_01_1815839	42	Mr. Nahai acknowledged that the litigious nature of the relationship would be difficult to break . ''
2007_01_01_1815839	43	Nobody can guarantee there wo n't be litigation in the future , and litigation has its uses , '' he said . ''
2007_01_01_1815839	44	There is no denying what the City of Los Angeles has done far too often has been because of court order . ''
2007_01_01_1815839	45	He added , '' It 's like what Mark Twain said : ` Whiskey is for drinking , and water is for fighting over . ' ''
2007_01_01_1815841	0	With his wife , his children and his parents looking on , Eliot Laurence Spitzer was officially sworn in at midnight as the 54th governor of New York State during a private ceremony here at the governor 's mansion .
2007_01_01_1815841	1	Standing by a fireplace , Mr. Spitzer placed his hand on a Bible and repeated the oath of office , in a very loud and clear voice : '' I , Eliot Spitzer , do solemnly swear that I will support the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of New York , and that I will faithfully discharge the duties of the governor of the State of New York according to the best of my abilities , so help me God . ''
2007_01_01_1815841	2	A cheer rose from the guests : '' Go get 'em , Eliot ! ''
2007_01_01_1815841	3	And with those words , New York 's Democrats reclaimed the governor 's office after 12 years of Republican rule , and Mr. Spitzer , 47 , ascended to a historic office that has been held by Franklin and Theodore Roosevelt , Alfred E. Smith , Thomas E. Dewey and Hugh L. Carey , who was present .
2007_01_01_1815841	4	A more festive public inauguration ceremony with pomp , circumstance , food and music is scheduled to be held Monday afternoon , but Mr. Spitzer needed to take the oath of office by midnight in order to ensure the smooth transition of government as he took over from Gov. George E. Pataki , whose 12-year term ended at midnight .
2007_01_01_1815841	5	Mr. Spitzer was sworn in by Judge Robert W. Sweet , the Federal District Court judge who gave Mr. Spitzer his start in public service , hiring him as a clerk in 1984 after his graduation from Harvard Law School .
2007_01_01_1815841	6	With the new governor were his wife , Silda Wall Spitzer ; his daughters , Elyssa , 17 , Sarabeth , 14 , and Jenna , 12 ; his parents , Bernard and Anne Spitzer ; and dozens of political figures and family friends .
2007_01_01_1815841	7	The party was not without drama .
2007_01_01_1815841	8	Lloyd Constantine -- Mr. Spitzer 's friend , tennis partner , onetime law partner and co-chairman of his transition team -- continued his tradition of buying Champagne for a Spitzer oath of office .
2007_01_01_1815841	9	The bottles seem to grow in size with the job .
2007_01_01_1815841	10	As Ms. Wall Spitzer put it , '' The bottles just keep getting bigger . ''
2007_01_01_1815841	11	This time Mr. Constantine went for a 12-liter bottle of Veuve Clicquot called a balthazar .
2007_01_01_1815841	12	But opening it did not prove easy -- the Champagne did not flow until Mr. Constantine attacked the giant bottle with a wrench , enlisted the help of another guest , and eventually broke the lip of the bottle , cutting his hand , and waving the bloody hand in triumph .
2007_01_01_1815841	13	Asked if it was worth it , he said , '' Yeah , sure . ''
2007_01_01_1815841	14	The public festivities later Monday were to feature New York State wines from Long Island , the Hudson Valley and the Finger Lakes , as well as regional specialties like Guss 's pickles , Junior 's cheesecake and Buffalo wings from the Anchor Bar in Buffalo .
2007_01_01_1815841	15	There was some trepidation about the weather forecast , though .
2007_01_01_1815841	16	Mr. Spitzer , who spoke about the value of optimism during the campaign , planned an outdoor inaugural for New Year 's Day in Albany ( and a 6 a.m. run through Washington Park ) .
2007_01_01_1815841	17	But with light rain falling , and freezing rain forecast , most of the inaugural events were pushed back an hour in the hopes that the bad weather would move through .
2007_01_01_1815842	0	As she wrote her first inaugural speech , M. Jodi Rell turned to the remarks of Gerald R. Ford .
2007_01_01_1815842	1	Like the former president who took over after the resignation of Richard M. Nixon , Governor Rell was looking for a way to soothe nerves , not make waves .
2007_01_01_1815842	2	She was sworn in on a hot day in July 2004 after the abrupt resignation of Gov. John G. Rowland , a Republican who would be sentenced to a year in federal prison on corruption charges . ''
2007_01_01_1815842	3	People were so disappointed , they were so disillusioned , they had just lost faith , '' Ms. Rell said , apparently referring to both her own situation and President Ford 's . ''
2007_01_01_1815842	4	They just needed somebody to say it 's going to be O.K. and we are going to get past this . ''
2007_01_01_1815842	5	Now , with Mr. Ford 's death coinciding with Ms. Rell 's preparation for her first full term , she said her role as the state 's leader had evolved .
2007_01_01_1815842	6	She was no longer the accidental governor . ''
2007_01_01_1815842	7	After the election , it just felt like coming back to work .
2007_01_01_1815842	8	Nothing really changed , '' Ms. Rell , a Republican who swept 63 percent of the vote in November , said in a recent interview at the Capitol here . ''
2007_01_01_1815842	9	But it 's only in the last week or so where it 's hit me -- this is different .
2007_01_01_1815842	10	The expectations and the new session gives you pause to say all right , this is what we are going to do .
2007_01_01_1815842	11	This is my agenda . ''
2007_01_01_1815842	12	Extremely popular and perceived as honest and calm , Ms. Rell is just now beginning to form her own cabinet , dismissing nearly all of Mr. Rowland 's top assistants .
2007_01_01_1815842	13	After two years largely characterized by initiatives to '' right the ship '' in a state crippled by corrupt politicians , Ms. Rell , who will be sworn in on Wednesday , now must attack more complex problems , such as soaring health care and energy costs .
2007_01_01_1815842	14	And though she was one of only a handful of Republicans in the Northeast who managed to retain a top office this election season , Ms. Rell faces a veto-proof Democratic majority in both chambers of the General Assembly .
2007_01_01_1815842	15	The dominance of Democrats could certainly hobble Ms. Rell 's plans to cut taxes .
2007_01_01_1815842	16	Already , she has compromised one of her signature ideas : after legislative leaders indicated they would block her efforts to cut the car tax , Ms. Rell dropped the subject , saying she would choose her battles carefully . ''
2007_01_01_1815842	17	I think we are approaching a time where we have to come up with some really creative solutions , and if the governor ca n't get there it is possible the honeymoon would be over , '' said Donald E. Williams Jr. , leader of the Democrats in the State Senate .
2007_01_01_1815842	18	But for all the chatter in political circles of their party 's new power , Mr. Williams and other Democrats speak of the Republican governor in tones usually reserved for one of their own . ''
2007_01_01_1815842	19	I do n't think anyone is looking for unnecessary fights , '' Senator Williams said . ''
2007_01_01_1815842	20	The governor has sealed her popularity among voters and made people feel extremely comfortable . ''
2007_01_01_1815842	21	Confrontation and flashy speech are not Ms. Rell 's style .
2007_01_01_1815842	22	Elected to the State House of Representatives in 1984 , she earned a reputation for dealing with mundane details , picking apart legislation and knowing precisely where there was room for compromise .
2007_01_01_1815842	23	That approach helped lead to a sense of Ms. Rell , 60 , as a maternal figure , something that has stuck through her term in executive office .
2007_01_01_1815842	24	Some Democrats remark privately that when the governor admonishes them to kill or push through a bill , it is like being scolded by their mother .
2007_01_01_1815842	25	Ms. Rell cultivates that image : In a season of brutal campaign attack advertisements , one of her commercials featured the governor sitting in a chair with her grandson .
2007_01_01_1815842	26	A public service announcement encouraging drivers not to drink and drive has Ms. Rell on a playground surrounded by children .
2007_01_01_1815842	27	And when she released a health care proposal last week , half a dozen children sat on either side waving to the television cameras .
2007_01_01_1815842	28	Peering out at the audience over her bifocals , Ms. Rell resembled a teacher reading the lesson of the day .
2007_01_01_1815842	29	Ms. Rell and her supporters have always been happy to acknowledge that she was an unlikely candidate to become the state 's top political figure .
2007_01_01_1815842	30	A former homemaker who dropped out of college , Ms. Rell earned her political education on the job , working her way up to become minority leader of the House before being tapped by Mr. Rowland to run for lieutenant governor .
2007_01_01_1815842	31	The two were never particularly close , and Ms. Rell maintains that she had no clue about Mr. Rowland 's wrongdoings , something that infuriates opponents trying to tie her to the corrupt administration .
2007_01_01_1815842	32	Such criticisms have somehow yet to stick .
2007_01_01_1815842	33	Even when Ms. Rell 's chief of staff became embroiled in controversy for distributing invitations to a political fund-raiser on state time last year , voters consistently told pollsters they trusted the Rell administration .
2007_01_01_1815842	34	Some people in both parties complain that Governor Rell has done little to articulate or push her own agenda , instead favoring policies typically backed by Democrats such as stem-cell research or civil unions for same-sex couples .
2007_01_01_1815842	35	Others see that as her strength . ''
2007_01_01_1815842	36	You hear Democrats claim : ` She has n't done anything , she has n't done anything , ' '' said Chris Barnes , a pollster at the University of Connecticut . ''
2007_01_01_1815842	37	Well , the last governor did something and the something was lining his pockets .
2007_01_01_1815842	38	People are quite happy this governor is not doing that something . ''
2007_01_01_1815842	39	Instead , Ms. Rell has wisely been '' adjusting the course rather that setting it , '' Mr. Barnes said . ''
2007_01_01_1815842	40	People were not begging for grandiose plans .
2007_01_01_1815842	41	They just want the government not to mess things up . ''
2007_01_01_1815842	42	Such a modest goal aptly sums up the governing philosophy of Ms. Rell , who describes herself a steadfast moderate who believes in '' less government , less intrusive government , and less spending whenever possible . ''
2007_01_01_1815842	43	Her biggest fights with the Legislature will likely be over the budget , which Ms. Rell will present in February , and taxes .
2007_01_01_1815842	44	Also , Democrats plan to making universal health care a top priority , while Ms. Rell last week offered a far more limited proposal than what Democrats envision .
2007_01_01_1815842	45	Ms. Rell opened the health care bidding last week with a plan to let uninsured adult residents buy into a pool with a premium of $ 250 a month .
2007_01_01_1815842	46	Emphasizing that she would not support a '' big government '' subsidy , Ms. Rell said the cost of the plan to the state would be minimal .
2007_01_01_1815842	47	After decades in public office , Ms. Rell can still appear wary of the spotlight , blushing at the slightest embarrassment or standing at the back of a crowd -- and she guards her privacy .
2007_01_01_1815842	48	When she had a mastectomy to remove breast cancer two days after Christmas in 2004 , her assistants did not announce the operation until she was already at the hospital and asked well-wishers not to send flowers .
2007_01_01_1815842	49	There are signs of increasing comfort with the pageantry ; on Wednesday , Ms. Rell will lead the first inaugural parade and ball the state has had in more than a decade ( though she turned down a society reporter 's request to photograph her off-white ball gown last week ) . ''
2007_01_01_1815842	50	I think you 're going to see more and more of her , '' said Robert Farr , an ally of Ms. Rell who recently retired from the General Assembly . ''
2007_01_01_1815842	51	A year ago she was the governor by accident , but she can clearly be the real thing now . ''
2007_01_01_1815842	52	She is not going to be one rushing for press conferences , '' Mr. Farr added . ''
2007_01_01_1815842	53	She is not one to go out and state a political position every day .
2007_01_01_1815842	54	But when she stakes something out , she is going to present something that can give measurable results . ''
2007_01_01_1815842	55	For her part , Ms. Rell said she is still drawing inspiration from the former president she looked to the first time she took the oath of office . ''
2007_01_01_1815842	56	Gerald Ford was not flashy , '' she said , her voice softening . ''
2007_01_01_1815842	57	He wanted to talk to people .
2007_01_01_1815842	58	And I know that 's what I want .
2007_01_01_1815842	59	I want people to feel comfortable .
2007_01_01_1815842	60	I want them to see a governor up close . ''
2007_01_01_1815843	0	In New York City , rapes , robberies and assaults , among other crimes , continued to decline last year , prompting the Police Department 's top official to herald 2006 as a very good year .
2007_01_01_1815843	1	Homicides , however , climbed 10 percent in the city , reversing a much-hailed decrease . ''
2007_01_01_1815843	2	We 'd like to see no homicides .
2007_01_01_1815843	3	The reality is we 're going to have them , '' said Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly . ''
2007_01_01_1815843	4	I think this is a very good year . ''
2007_01_01_1815843	5	He called the increase in killings in 2006 all but negligible compared with 1990 , a year with one of the highest homicide rates in recent history .
2007_01_01_1815843	6	That year , crack-fueled violence soared , and 2,262 people were killed .
2007_01_01_1815843	7	Last year there were 579 killings citywide as of Dec. 24 , an increase of 52 homicides over the same period in 2005 .
2007_01_01_1815843	8	Yet overall crime last year was down 5 percent .
2007_01_01_1815843	9	The number of reported rapes declined by 7.4 percent to 1,486 , subway crime plunged 13 percent and auto theft fell 11.4 percent .
2007_01_01_1815843	10	The police said the year 's jump in homicides was rooted largely in an unusually high number of '' reclassified '' deaths , deaths linked to injuries incurred in months or years past .
2007_01_01_1815843	11	There were 38 reclassified homicides in New York last year , compared with 21 in 2005 .
2007_01_01_1815843	12	New York 's overall fall in crime also contrasts with an increase nationwide .
2007_01_01_1815843	13	According to a report by the F.B.I. , violent crime across the country rose 3.7 percent during the first half of the year .
2007_01_01_1815843	14	Dallas remained the country 's most violent city , with 3,985 crimes per 100,000 people , according to the midyear report , while New York ranked 10th with 1,1,87 per 100,000 .
2007_01_01_1815843	15	Myriad factors account for New York 's continuing decline in crime overall , the police and criminologists say .
2007_01_01_1815843	16	They cited more effective policing , shifting drug patterns and the lowest unemployment rate in 30 years .
2007_01_01_1815843	17	Yet what is puzzling , one expert said , is that overall crime is dropping even as New York becomes an increasingly polarized city , with haves and have-nots often living side by side in luxury condominiums and public housing . ''
2007_01_01_1815843	18	Within a few blocks , people are living worlds apart , '' said Andrew Karmen , a sociology professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and the author of '' New York Murder Mystery : The True Story Behind the Crime Crash of the 1990s . '' ''
2007_01_01_1815843	19	In theory , that should make the poor more dissatisfied and drive people to commit crimes , '' he said . ''
2007_01_01_1815843	20	But that does n't seem to be happening in New York . ''
2007_01_01_1815843	21	One possible explanation , Dr. Karmen said , is that the city is largely populated by immigrants , many of whom are driven by a determination to succeed . ''
2007_01_01_1815843	22	I think they still maintain a positive outlook and faith in the American dream , '' he said . ''
2007_01_01_1815843	23	But if it does n't deliver , attitudes could change . ''
2007_01_01_1815843	24	It has proven difficult to root out violent crime in the city 's toughest corners .
2007_01_01_1815843	25	One of the city 's most perilous neighborhoods is in the 75th Precinct in Brooklyn , which includes East New York .
2007_01_01_1815843	26	There the number of slayings last year was virtually unchanged from 2005 at 28 , and 3,239 crimes were reported .
2007_01_01_1815843	27	Public housing projects have a disproportionate number of crimes .
2007_01_01_1815843	28	While 5 percent of New York 's eight million residents live in public housing , Commissioner Kelly said , 16 percent of the city 's homicides take place there .
2007_01_01_1815843	29	The Police Department plans to tackle that seemingly intractable problem by redeploying personnel from other areas and opening police substations in the most troubled housing complexes , Commissioner Kelly said .
2007_01_01_1815843	30	Both homicide victims and suspects tend to have links to crime already , he said .
2007_01_01_1815843	31	Of those arrested last year in homicides , 95 percent had criminal histories ; 75 percent of the people killed did .
2007_01_01_1815843	32	Such figures point to the department 's need to continue expanding its homicide , shooting and crime databases , Mr. Kelly said . ''
2007_01_01_1815843	33	The more information we have , the greater the potential we have to prevent crimes , '' he said .
2007_01_01_1815843	34	New York 's rebirth as a safer-than-average large city since the 1990s has coincided with an increase in tourism here .
2007_01_01_1815843	35	According to city officials , about 44 million people visited last year on business or pleasure . ''
2007_01_01_1815843	36	One overarching reason why people are coming here , in a city that was attacked five years ago , it 's because they have a sense of comfort as far as security is concerned , '' Mr. Kelly said .
2007_01_01_1815843	37	The department is continuing to pour more resources into community policing , forging bonds between its officials and local leaders , especially those from new immigrant communities .
2007_01_01_1815843	38	Yet in neighborhoods where homicide rates climbed , residents seem divided about whether this recent and heightened focus was improving their lives .
2007_01_01_1815843	39	Allah B , the director of the Allah in Mecca Youth Center in Harlem , commended officers in its precinct , the 28th , for holding local forums and listening to community concerns .
2007_01_01_1815843	40	Even though slayings in the precinct more than doubled , to 11 , last year , he said the increased connection between residents and the police fostered a greater sense of ease .
2007_01_01_1815843	41	Yet a longtime resident of the St. Nicholas Homes in Harlem said police efforts to rout out criminals were having a divisive effect in her neighborhood . ''
2007_01_01_1815843	42	They caused a lot of trouble trying to play one person against the other , '' said the woman , who would give only her first name , Keisha .
2007_01_01_1815843	43	She said people in the neighborhood also felt harassed and persecuted by the police , and that such impressions heightened the tension and stress in the community .
2007_01_01_1815843	44	Still , despite a slight increase in the number of homicides in her neighborhood , she said the streets felt far less violent than in previous years .
2007_01_01_1815843	45	The sense that New Yorkers are increasingly inhabiting two different realities seems particularly strong in places like Fort Greene , Brooklyn , home to a thriving cafe scene and crime-plagued public housing complexes .
2007_01_01_1815843	46	Eleven homicides were recorded in the neighborhood last year , compared with none in 2005 .
2007_01_01_1815843	47	Strolling along a stretch of DeKalb Avenue by Fort Greene Park late last week , Cheryl Pickett , 36 , said she had no idea that murders had risen so sharply in the area .
2007_01_01_1815843	48	Ms. Pickett , who has lived in Fort Greene for five years , said her perception of the neighborhood had not changed .
2007_01_01_1815843	49	She still thinks of it as a safe , child-friendly place with charming shops and bars . ''
2007_01_01_1815843	50	When things happen , it 's really surprising , '' Ms. Pickett said . ''
2007_01_01_1815843	51	This year seems no different than last . ''
2007_01_01_1815844	0	As fighting began to flare Sunday around Kismayo , in southern Somalia , the final redoubt for the country 's diminished Islamic movement , elders within the city demanded that the Islamists go .
2007_01_01_1815844	1	Muhammad Arab , a leader of the Ogaden subclan , said 36 elders of various clans and subclans met over the weekend with Islamist leaders and tried to persuade them that resistance against the huge Ethiopian-backed force heading toward them was futile . ''
2007_01_01_1815844	2	We told them that they were going to lose , '' Mr. Arab said , '' and that our city would get destroyed . ''
2007_01_01_1815844	3	Kismayo , a scenic harbor town along the Indian Ocean that was once part of the East African spice empire , has been spared the fighting so far .
2007_01_01_1815844	4	But the Islamists , Mr. Arab said , did not care . ''
2007_01_01_1815844	5	These guys are bent on war , '' he said .
2007_01_01_1815844	6	The fighting started around 5 p.m. , with the Ethiopian-backed forces unleashing an artillery barrage against Islamist troops dug in near Jilib , a town about 30 miles north of Kismayo .
2007_01_01_1815844	7	[ Residents of Kismayo told Reuters Monday that Somali Islamists fled overnight from their final stronghold around the southern port of the city .
2007_01_01_1815844	8	Several thousand Somalia Islamic Courts Council fighters had been making a last stand north of Kismayo port , but residents said they melted away after the advancing Ethiopian force began its shelling of Jilib .
2007_01_01_1815844	9	Somalia 's interim government vowed to pursue them . ]
2007_01_01_1815844	10	As the shells began to rain down in Jilib , residents said , clan militias in Kismayo turned on the Islamists .
2007_01_01_1815844	11	That set off running gun battles across the city , with several people reported killed .
2007_01_01_1815844	12	It also accelerated the exodus from Kismayo , with thousands of residents hastily gathering a few belongings and joining the stream of people fleeing the fighting in southern Somalia .
2007_01_01_1815844	13	It is hard to predict what is going to happen next .
2007_01_01_1815844	14	Local support for the Islamists in Kismayo is obviously evaporating , just as it did last week in Mogadishu , Somalia 's capital , when clan elders decided that the Islamists were a losing cause and pulled their troops and weapons out of the movement .
2007_01_01_1815844	15	That led to the city falling much faster than anyone expected into the hands of Somalia 's transitional government , which has used Ethiopian troops and airpower to reclaim much of the country .
2007_01_01_1815844	16	Clan elders are the pillars of Somali society , and many of the Islamist fighters in Mogadishu were clan militiamen lent to the movement .
2007_01_01_1815844	17	But the fighters in Kismayo may be different .
2007_01_01_1815844	18	Kismayo is where the Islamist leadership fled after losing Mogadishu , taking their most steadfast and hard-core fighters .
2007_01_01_1815844	19	Ethiopian officials have said that the Somali Islamists are bolstered by several thousand foreign fighters -- from Yemen , Pakistan , Syria , Libya and Eritrea , Ethiopia 's bitter enemy , though American intelligence officials have said that the numbers are far fewer , most likely in the hundreds .
2007_01_01_1815844	20	Diplomats are still searching for a way to avert disaster .
2007_01_01_1815844	21	On Sunday , Kenyan officials , with American encouragement , continued to meet in Nairobi with the few remaining moderate leaders of the Islamist movement in an effort to reach a cease-fire .
2007_01_01_1815844	22	But the talks were slow-going , said an official close to the parties .
2007_01_01_1815844	23	In Mogadishu , the transitional prime minister , Ali Mohammed Gedi , seems to relish his newfound authority .
2007_01_01_1815844	24	Mr. Gedi , a bookish veterinarian whom few Somalis would have recognized before last week 's stunning comeback by the transitional government , is holding daily news conferences , meeting with clan elders and surveying bombed-out buildings for future office space .
2007_01_01_1815844	25	On Sunday , he reassured the populace in confident tones that the era of warlord rule was over .
2007_01_01_1815845	0	A driver killed on Saturday when his car flipped and overturned in a parking lot was racing another driver , the police said yesterday .
2007_01_01_1815845	1	The driver who died was identified as John Southern , 35 , of South Jamaica , Queens .
2007_01_01_1815845	2	The second driver , Edwin Washington , 22 , of Jamaica , was charged with criminally negligent homicide , reckless endangerment and reckless driving , the police said .
2007_01_01_1815845	3	The two men were racing about 5:30 p.m. on Saturday along North Conduit Avenue near 78th Street in Jamaica when Mr. Southern 's white Mitsubishi Galant overturned , the police said .
2007_01_01_1815845	4	A passenger in Mr. Southern 's car , Cory Sapp , 18 , of Queens , was also arrested and charged , after police officers found a gun in the Galant , the police said .
2007_01_01_1815846	0	A driver from New Rochelle ran another vehicle off the Long Island Expressway yesterday morning , then pulled over , and at the sight of a severely injured passenger in the other vehicle , fled on foot , the police said .
2007_01_01_1815846	1	Two of the three men in the injured passenger 's vehicle , a GMC Yukon , and a passing off-duty police officer , Michael Leone , caught up with the driver , the police said .
2007_01_01_1815846	2	The collision occurred shortly before 6 a.m. on the eastbound lanes of the expressway at 69th Street in Maspeth , Queens , the police said .
2007_01_01_1815846	3	The man 's sport utility vehicle veered into the GMC Yukon , pushing it onto the shoulder , the police said .
2007_01_01_1815846	4	The badly injured passenger , a woman who was in the back seat , was said to be in critical condition yesterday evening at New York Hospital Medical Center of Queens .
2007_01_01_1815846	5	All three men in the Yukon suffered minor injuries .
2007_01_01_1815846	6	The driver of the first vehicle , Alexie Quiles , 26 , was charged with vehicular assault and driving while intoxicated , the police said .
2007_01_01_1815846	7	He was also charged with illegal possession of a weapon after officers found a gun in his vehicle , the police said .
2007_01_01_1815847	0	One person was found dead after a fire tore through a third-floor apartment last night , the authorities said .
2007_01_01_1815847	1	The victim , who was too badly burned to be immediately identified , was found in an apartment building on Manor Drive , south of Ivy Hill Park , said John Brown , a Fire Department spokesman .
2007_01_01_1815847	2	The one-alarm fire apparently started sometime before 10:30 p.m. in the bedroom , Chief Michael Lalor said .
2007_01_01_1815847	3	The cause was still being investigated .
2007_01_01_1815848	0	Two people were killed and another person was seriously injured after a sport utility vehicle slammed into a sedan on Route 1 and 9 yesterday evening , the police said .
2007_01_01_1815848	1	They did not identify the victims , but said the two people killed had been in the same car , a red Ford Fusion .
2007_01_01_1815848	2	According to a witness , a woman walked out of the Days Inn at 2750 Tonnelle Avenue about 6 p.m. and got into the driver 's seat of the Ford .
2007_01_01_1815848	3	She left the motel 's driveway and tried to cut across the northbound lane of Route 1 and 9 , but a Dodge Durango plowed into her car , causing serious damage to the driver 's side , said Amir Kadri , 26 , a witness .
2007_01_01_1815848	4	The driver of the Dodge , a man , was taken to Jersey City Medical Center in serious condition , the police said .
2007_01_01_1815849	0	The Islamist forces in Somalia abandoned their final stronghold Monday morning , fleeing the port city of Kismayo much like they had fled Mogadishu , the capital , last week .
2007_01_01_1815849	1	In the face of an intense artillery barrage by Ethiopian-backed forces and thousands of well-equipped troops heading their way , the Islamists scattered , with some of their militia shedding their uniforms and melting back into the population while others headed south towards a thickly forested area along the Kenya border . ''
2007_01_01_1815849	2	I ca n't tell you how happy people were that they disappeared , '' Adam Ragay , a businessman in Kismayo , said today .
2007_01_01_1815849	3	As soon as the Islamists left , looters rushed into the streets and smashed up stores and ran away with TVs and mobile phones .
2007_01_01_1815849	4	But by mid-afternoon , the brief burst of anarchy was over and transitional government troops had arrived on the outskirts of town . ''
2007_01_01_1815849	5	I can confirm to you that our forces have captured Kismayo , '' Somalia 's transitional prime minister , Ali Mohamed Gedi , told The Associated Press today .
2007_01_01_1815849	6	This leaves the transitional government of Somalia now in control of every major town in south-central Somalia , though there are fears the war may not be over and that the Islamists are simply switching to underground guerilla tactics .
2007_01_01_1815849	7	It took the transitional government , with the help of the Ethiopian military , one of the most powerful in Africa , all of one week to rout the Islamists .
2007_01_01_1815849	8	Residents of Kismayo said the remaining Islamists were heading toward Ras Kamboni , a small town on the Kenyan border which western intelligence officers say has been used as a terrorist hide-out before .
2007_01_01_1815849	9	Kenya officials have said that they have increased security on the border to keep the Islamists from escaping through Kenya .

2007_01_01_1815849	34	A large explosion rocked an apartment building in Mogadishu on Saturday night , killing a woman .
2007_01_01_1815849	35	Some residents said it was a missile fired at nearby Ethiopian troops and possibly the opening salvo of an anti-Ethiopian insurgency .
2007_01_01_1815849	36	Later in the day , Ethiopian troops began to recede from Mogadishu 's streets to barracks on the outskirts of the city .

2007_03_01_1829590	0	AFTER hibernating in front of the television for four months , Matt Goodrich felt flabby .
2007_03_01_1829590	1	He wanted a rigorous regimen to rouse his body from its winter slumber .
2007_03_01_1829590	2	But there was just one problem : Mr. Goodrich , a 33-year-old married father of two , did not want women to see him in all his sweat-stained glory . ''
2007_03_01_1829590	3	The idea of girls watching me as I struggle through my situps made me a little nervous , '' said Mr. Goodrich , a sales representative in Beverly Hills , Mich. .
2007_03_01_1829590	4	Not least because watching a ripped woman do more crunches than him would crush his spirits .
2007_03_01_1829590	5	When a friend told him about a 12-week men 's - only fitness boot camp that promised to banish his love handles with sets of hanging leg raises and one-arm push-ups , Mr. Goodrich leapt at the chance . ''
2007_03_01_1829590	6	That it was just guys made it that much easier to sign up , '' he said .
2007_03_01_1829590	7	After years of slimming down brides for their big day , or offering mixed classes , boot camps are going back to their roots with all-male programs that cater to those who prefer not to exercise in the company of women .
2007_03_01_1829590	8	Enlistees of these men-only camps say they are drawn by the focus on muscle building , seeing the same guys up to five days a week , and what they feel is a tougher workout than those offered to women .
2007_03_01_1829590	9	Multiweek boot camps , often held in parks or rented studios , aim to drop pounds faster than a ho-hum exercise fix of lifting and cardio .
2007_03_01_1829590	10	Usually run by former military people or personal trainers , the back-to-basics camps involve high-intensity moves like sprinting , jumping jacks and calisthenics that rely on one 's own body weight to perform push-ups and pull-ups .
2007_03_01_1829590	11	The high intensity of boot camps elevates the post-workout metabolism more than moderate exercise , said Tommy Boone , a founder of the American Society of Exercise Physiologists , a trade group .
2007_03_01_1829590	12	But he cautioned that many boot-camps are high-impact , which could result in muscle injuries .
2007_03_01_1829590	13	Boot camps remain attractive because they promise that participants will lose a lot of weight in a short amount of time , said Steve Edwards , a sports psychology professor at Oklahoma State University . ''
2007_03_01_1829590	14	Mentally , it 's far easier for someone to buckle down for four weeks than to think about going to the gym for six months . ''
2007_03_01_1829590	15	Introduced among civilians in the early '80s , military-style boot camps at first targeted only men perhaps because owners figured women would n't appreciate screaming drill sergeants like those in Stanley Kubrick 's '' Full Metal Jacket . ''
2007_03_01_1829590	16	But in the '90s , it was women , particularly brides hoping to shed pounds swiftly , who fueled the growth of boot camps , leading to legions of all-female programs nationwide .
2007_03_01_1829590	17	Some camps remained as rigorous as the original civilian camps ; others , with names like Bridal Bootcamp , offered the conventional workouts fused with Pilates , toning exercises for glutes and stability ball work .
2007_03_01_1829590	18	Some of the less traditional exercises trickled into mixed classes , causing a backlash among men . ''
2007_03_01_1829590	19	I wanted to get rid of years of margaritas and barbecue ribs , but I did n't want to do it by working my inner thighs or sculpting my legs , '' said Lee Rigby , 32 , a lawyer . ''
2007_03_01_1829590	20	I needed something more masculine . ''
2007_03_01_1829590	21	In January , to lose 15 pounds , Mr. Rigby plunked down $ 299 to join a men 's only program at the Austin Adventure Boot Camp for four weeks .
2007_03_01_1829590	22	Six months ago , Stephanie McDonald , owner of the Austin camp , began offering the all-male option after repeated requests from men in her two mixed classes who tired of '' watered-down '' exercises . ''
2007_03_01_1829590	23	When I would do more girly moves like leg lifts in the mixed group , men would make fun of them , '' Ms. McDonald said . ''
2007_03_01_1829590	24	Guys want a muscular upper body and women want to fit into their favorite pair of jeans .
2007_03_01_1829590	25	Their goals are different . ''
2007_03_01_1829590	26	She tapped Michael Roque , a former Marine turned personal trainer , to lead clients as they did drills like climbing 40 stairs more than 20 times or dragging a 70-pound bag across a football field .
2007_03_01_1829590	27	The camp is one of 120 independently owned and licensed in the United States under the Adventure Boot Camp name , which started in 2000 .
2007_03_01_1829590	28	In the last year , 23 outposts have introduced all-male camps .
2007_03_01_1829590	29	Segregation makes business sense , some owners say .
2007_03_01_1829590	30	In 2005 , Jennifer Gray , a personal trainer in the Detroit area , started Body Beautiful Boot Camp to slim brides , and later catered to all women .
2007_03_01_1829590	31	But when she tried a co-ed camp , it faltered . ''
2007_03_01_1829590	32	In the women 's camp , we 'd go around the room and announce how much weight each girl lost that week and clap , '' she said . ''
2007_03_01_1829590	33	It had a very support-group feel . ''
2007_03_01_1829590	34	That atmosphere vanished when men joined , leaving the women ill at ease .
2007_03_01_1829590	35	The men were equally self-conscious around the fittest of the women . ''
2007_03_01_1829590	36	The guys would get frustrated that they could n't do as many push-ups and not show up , '' Ms. Gray said .
2007_03_01_1829590	37	The first men 's session in January had only five takers , but 50 men signed up for the second , including Mr. Goodrich .
2007_03_01_1829590	38	Though many camps are marketed as gender-specific , it is n't strictly enforced .
2007_03_01_1829590	39	It 's buyer 's choice .
2007_03_01_1829590	40	Women attend boot camps for the '' social dimension , '' said Dr. Edwards , the sports psychologist .
2007_03_01_1829590	41	They '' like the idea that there are people there in the same situation as them . ''
2007_03_01_1829590	42	But he added that men '' usually go with more of a task orientation than women . '' ''
2007_03_01_1829590	43	They may want to perform in a sport , for example , '' he said .
2007_03_01_1829590	44	And being surrounded by men also makes men feel '' like they are not going to be held back by women . ''
2007_03_01_1829590	45	Men wrongly assume that women do n't hustle like they do .
2007_03_01_1829590	46	Women '' work much harder than men because there is more societal pressure on them to be thin , '' said Patrick Avon , a former Navy petty officer who has run the Sergeant 's Program boot camp in the Washington D.C. area since 1989 .
2007_03_01_1829590	47	At that time , the then three-week program was all men .
2007_03_01_1829590	48	At first Mr. Avon advertised the camp with the slogan '' Physical Fitness for Men . ''
2007_03_01_1829590	49	( '' No girls , '' posters crowed . )
2007_03_01_1829590	50	But after women responded in greater numbers than men , despite the admonition , Mr. Avon opened the camp to both sexes .
2007_03_01_1829590	51	To this day , it remains a classic boot camp focused on bodyweight exercises and cardiovascular challenges like climbing hills .
2007_03_01_1829590	52	That is part of the reason Mr. Avon says segregation of the sexes is pointless . ''
2007_03_01_1829590	53	If you 're teaching the true boot camp , then you do n't need to have separate camps , '' he said .
2007_03_01_1829590	54	The proportion of women 's and mixed boot camps is far larger than men 's only , and some boot camp owners say they have tried to unsuccessfully start men 's programs .
2007_03_01_1829590	55	Still , men 's boot camps are modestly growing .
2007_03_01_1829590	56	Roughly three dozen all-male camps have cropped up in the last 18 months .
2007_03_01_1829590	57	At least five are in the works , including a handful that are group fitness classes at gyms .
2007_03_01_1829590	58	( Next month , Reebok Sports Club/NY on the Upper West Side will offer a men 's kettlebell boot camp . )
2007_03_01_1829590	59	But even as boot camps return to their roots with men-only classes , they have strayed from their military beginnings .
2007_03_01_1829590	60	While some are still taught by former military people who are n't always certified to teach fitness , many are run by personal trainers who have n't experienced the rigors of the original .
2007_03_01_1829590	61	Today 's boot camps even incorporate kickboxing and kung fu , as well as Pilates .
2007_03_01_1829590	62	Gone is the military-style berating .
2007_03_01_1829590	63	Students work within their limits .
2007_03_01_1829590	64	Now instead of drop and give me 50 , it 's give me as many push-ups as you can in 30 seconds .
2007_03_01_1829590	65	Boot camps can still be punishing .
2007_03_01_1829590	66	Barry Weiner , 58 , an accountant from Basking Ridge , N.J. , who races motorcycles in his spare time , said he signed up for a men 's boot camp because he did n't like how he looked in racing gear .
2007_03_01_1829590	67	He woke up at 5 a.m. each weekday for eight weeks to hop back and forth over a two-foot-high fence and climb stadium steps . ''
2007_03_01_1829590	68	It was more intense than any workout I 've ever done , '' Mr. Weiner said . ''
2007_03_01_1829590	69	I do n't look like the Michelin Man anymore . ''

2007_03_01_1829591	0	UNTIL recently , most weight vests were bulky 50-pound training tools designed for firefighters and football players .
2007_03_01_1829591	1	So a lot of walkers looking to increase their calorie burn carted around hand weights instead .
2007_03_01_1829591	2	Now vests made for walkers have hit the market .
2007_03_01_1829591	3	They range from 4 to 30 pounds , and many are adjustable .
2007_03_01_1829591	4	The makers of these vests ( which can vary in price based on their weight ) say they are safer , more effective alternatives to hand weights , which can strain shoulders and elbows .
2007_03_01_1829591	5	Some biomechanics researchers agree . ''
2007_03_01_1829591	6	The best place to put weight is evenly distributed on the trunk , '' said Peter Francis , an emeritus professor of exercise at San Diego State University .
2007_03_01_1829591	7	A 2006 University of Iowa study published in the journal Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise also found that walking with a weighted vest can raise caloric burn by about 7 percent and increase exercise intensity .
2007_03_01_1829591	8	Mark Fenton , a former racewalker and the author of '' The Complete Guide to Walking for Health , Weight Loss and Fitness , '' wore vests during 2 to 3 mile walks on varied terrain and doing calisthenics .
2007_03_01_1829592	0	THE banquet of lobster bisque , duck salad , lamb chops and Grey Goose was lost on Gaby Mitnik . ''
2007_03_01_1829592	1	After all those vodkas , I do n't remember what I ate , '' confided Ms. Mitnik , who celebrated her 30th birthday at Rasputin in February .
2007_03_01_1829592	2	She is one in a crush of Russian-Americans who make the Brooklyn restaurant and cabaret their weekend haunt .
2007_03_01_1829592	3	Intent on recreating the louche atmosphere of an authentic Moscow club , they dress to thrill , the men tricked out in satin shirts and silk cravats , the women in strapless brocade .
2007_03_01_1829592	4	A few , like Alina Constantinescu , bottom right , turned down the wattage , her hair cascading over a simple , if slinky , black dress .
2007_03_01_1829592	5	Though her meal was a blur , Ms. Mitnik could recite the particulars of her ensemble with impressive recall , down to the green garter belt and fishnet hose she wore in homage to Rasputin 's darkly Old World vibe . ''
2007_03_01_1829592	6	I 'm Russian , '' she said . ''
2007_03_01_1829592	7	It 's a cultural thing . ''
2007_03_01_1829593	0	AFTER her identical twin , Cara , died last year of a drug overdose , life stopped for her , too , Christa Parravani said .
2007_03_01_1829593	1	Work served as a bitter , inadequate refuge .
2007_03_01_1829593	2	For the first time in her life , Ms. Parravani , a photographer , was alone . ''
2007_03_01_1829593	3	I feel guilty for being alive , like it 's a curious and exceptional thing , '' she said .
2007_03_01_1829593	4	Yet when Ms. Parravani stood up before a group of strangers at a Midtown Manhattan restaurant last December and told them of losing Cara , she felt a sense of kinship , she said .
2007_03_01_1829593	5	They were all people whose twin siblings had died , and they had come together in a bereavement group called Twinless Twins .
2007_03_01_1829593	6	One young woman spoke of losing her sister to breast cancer in their early 30s .
2007_03_01_1829593	7	Another 's brother died of AIDS . ''
2007_03_01_1829593	8	There 's this sort of void left when one 's twin dies , '' Ms. Parravani , 29 , said of Cara 's death . ''
2007_03_01_1829593	9	In the claustrophobia of the relationship , there comes a comfort in some way .
2007_03_01_1829593	10	It seems unusual to breathe now . ''
2007_03_01_1829593	11	Those who come into the world with another person may not think about the possibility that their twin might die apart from them .
2007_03_01_1829593	12	But almost always , one twin dies before another .
2007_03_01_1829593	13	From that moment , twins say , the uniqueness of life as a twin carries over into the grief they feel .
2007_03_01_1829593	14	People who turn to groups like Twinless Twins by definition had close , though often difficult , relationships with their twin siblings .
2007_03_01_1829593	15	Intimacy may be greater between identical twins than fraternal ones , but both kinds of twins said in one study that the loss of their twin hurts longer , and more intensely , than the loss of nearly anyone else .
2007_03_01_1829593	16	When their twin dies , the remaining ones often experience profound survivors ' guilt .
2007_03_01_1829593	17	They have problems with other intimate relationships .
2007_03_01_1829593	18	Birthdays bring on mourning , said Dr. Nancy L. Segal , professor of psychology at California State University , Fullerton , and director of the Twin Studies Center .
2007_03_01_1829593	19	The number of multiple births has risen steadily over the last 40 years , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , which means the particular grief experienced by twins will spread through the lives of many more Americans .
2007_03_01_1829593	20	In 2004 , according to the centers , 3.2 percent of live births were twins , compared with 1.9 percent in 1984 .
2007_03_01_1829593	21	Those who are n't twins seem largely unable to appreciate the depth and complexity of twin bereavement , therapists and twins themselves said . ''
2007_03_01_1829593	22	Twins need to reach out to twins who have the same experience so that they can end their isolation , '' said Mary R. Morgan , a therapist in New York and an expert in twin bereavement . ''
2007_03_01_1829593	23	What struck me is that although it takes awhile for any group to trust one another , when twinless twins get together in a group , they seem to sense and trust each other immediately , enabling them to move forward in the healing process . ''
2007_03_01_1829593	24	Research involving twins rarely looks at the relationships between them , Dr. Segal said .
2007_03_01_1829593	25	Rather , scientists use twins to explore the roles nature and nurture play in a range of health and behavioral phenomena .
2007_03_01_1829593	26	Dr. Segal , author of '' Entwined Lives : Twins and What They Tell Us About Human Behavior , '' studied identical and fraternal twin children at the University of Chicago and found that identical twins tended to cooperate more with each other and were gentler with each other than fraternal twins were .
2007_03_01_1829593	27	Her research into bereavement after the loss of a twin , compared with the loss of other relatives , with the exception of children , indicated that identical twins felt a more powerful and persistent grief than fraternal twins , but that both kinds of twins felt that the loss of their sibling was more severe than any other loss .
2007_03_01_1829593	28	Twinless Twins was founded in 1986 by Dr. Raymond W. Brandt , a therapist from Fort Wayne , Ind. , who had lost his identical twin decades earlier .
2007_03_01_1829593	29	( Dr. Brandt died in 2001 . )
2007_03_01_1829593	30	The group has 10 chapters around the country and four in Australia , the United Kingdom and Canada .
2007_03_01_1829593	31	The group has 400 paid members and 350 registered users of its Web site .
2007_03_01_1829593	32	Twinless Twins holds regional meetings and an annual national convention where people talk about their twins and their loss .
2007_03_01_1829593	33	At the national meeting , there are also workshops for spouses and parents of twins .
2007_03_01_1829593	34	Telling a roomful of strangers about losing your twin is like going off the high dive , said Michael Caruso , a 58-year-old physical therapist in Highland , Md. .
2007_03_01_1829593	35	In the summer of 1970 , a hit-and-run driver killed Mr. Caruso 's identical twin , Lee , as he walked a motorcycle with a flat tire down a two-lane road on the Jersey Shore .
2007_03_01_1829593	36	Two years before that , Lee had tried to kill himself .
2007_03_01_1829593	37	Mr. Caruso still can not distinguish himself from his brother in some childhood pictures .
2007_03_01_1829593	38	He was profoundly disturbed by his brother 's suicidal behavior , and his early death meant they never got to talk about it .
2007_03_01_1829593	39	Their family urged him to '' suck it up and move on , '' Mr. Caruso said .
2007_03_01_1829593	40	He entered romantic relationships looking for a woman to be as close to him as Lee had been , a common reaction to the yearning for intimacy among those who have lost their twins .
2007_03_01_1829593	41	After two marriages that failed , therapy and a career helping others in chronic pain , Mr. Caruso went to his first Twinless Twins meeting .
2007_03_01_1829593	42	Over time , he learned to accept his brother 's loss and that he could not have stopped him from attempting suicide or his eventual death .
2007_03_01_1829593	43	He met his current wife , Susan Gray , after starting the meetings , and he says that for the first time , he was not needy in a relationship . ''
2007_03_01_1829593	44	I let go of the fact that I ca n't heal someone , '' Mr. Caruso said . ''
2007_03_01_1829593	45	I can only offer help . ''
2007_03_01_1829593	46	When Joshua Fleck looks at the grown-ups in Twinless Twins , he sees his own life some day .
2007_03_01_1829593	47	He is 11 years old and the only child of Caitlin and Ken Fleck of Horsham , Pa. .
2007_03_01_1829593	48	Five years ago , his identical twin , Shayne , died of an inoperable brain tumor .
2007_03_01_1829593	49	The boys had the same blue blankets .
2007_03_01_1829593	50	After his brother died , Joshua asked that a piece of Shayne 's blanket be stitched into his and a piece from his sewn into his brother 's and placed in his coffin with him .
2007_03_01_1829593	51	He still sleeps with that blanket .
2007_03_01_1829593	52	A year after his brother 's death , Joshua told his mother that a '' big piece of his heart went with Shayne , '' Ms. Fleck said .
2007_03_01_1829593	53	She told him about Twinless Twins .
2007_03_01_1829593	54	Joshua said he worried about what adults there would think of him , but he found friends at the local chapter and the national meeting . ''
2007_03_01_1829593	55	When I look at Twinless Twins , they all lost their twins but they 're great people , '' Joshua said . ''
2007_03_01_1829593	56	They have n't gotten over it , because you never really get over it .
2007_03_01_1829593	57	But they have lived their lives to the fullest while still remembering their twin . ''
2007_03_01_1829593	58	Carolyn Shane , 56 , has finally persuaded her family to take her 9-year-old grandniece to Twinless Twins .
2007_03_01_1829593	59	The little girl lost her twin within days of their birth and Ms. Shane noticed a reticence and sadness for years .
2007_03_01_1829593	60	Ms. Shane is the little girl 's special aunt because she lost her twin , too , in different ways , several times .
2007_03_01_1829593	61	Ms. Shane 's twin brother , Cary Schuman , was born severely brain damaged in their native Illinois .
2007_03_01_1829593	62	Ms. Shane , who lives in Maplewood , N.J. , said she always felt a need to protect her brother .
2007_03_01_1829593	63	But their parents placed him in an institution when he was 5 .
2007_03_01_1829593	64	From age 10 to 21 , Ms. Shane was not taken at all to see her brother .
2007_03_01_1829593	65	Her father could not cope with his son 's disability , so Cary was never mentioned at home .
2007_03_01_1829593	66	Cary died of cancer nine years ago . ''
2007_03_01_1829593	67	I always knew I was an ` us ' , but everyone treated me as a ` me , ' as just one , '' Ms. Shane said .
2007_03_01_1829593	68	Her grief upon her brother 's death was so great , she said , that she felt she was going insane .
2007_03_01_1829593	69	That feeling abated once she began meeting with others at Twinless Twins . ''
2007_03_01_1829593	70	It 's like we have an unbreakable bond of immediate understanding and empathy , '' she said .
2007_03_01_1829593	71	Ms. Parravani is now wending her way through the landscape that other twins have traveled .
2007_03_01_1829593	72	She and Cara went to college together .
2007_03_01_1829593	73	Cara was the writer , she the photographer .
2007_03_01_1829593	74	But their shared life was torn apart when Cara was raped , five years before her death .
2007_03_01_1829593	75	Cara was deeply troubled that her sister could not fully understand what she had been through , Ms. Parravani said .
2007_03_01_1829593	76	Ms. Parravani left graduate school for a time to look after Cara , as Cara 's marriage and her emotional health fell apart .
2007_03_01_1829593	77	She could coax her sister outside only to pose for a series of photographs Christa was assembling of twins in different landscapes .
2007_03_01_1829593	78	Her sister began to use heroin , Ms. Parravani said , and she died of an accidental fentanyl overdose . ''
2007_03_01_1829593	79	The hardest part is relearning who I am in the world without her , '' she said , sitting in her gallery in Brooklyn , surrounded by pictures of the two of them . ''
2007_03_01_1829593	80	Without her , it 's a long road for me . ''
2007_03_01_1829596	0	WHEN Laura Sessions Stepp warned of the potentially damaging effects of '' hooking up '' in a new book , some people scoffed -- particularly those who believe they were unscathed by their own unfettered years of casual sex .
2007_03_01_1829596	1	Others , though , were incensed .
2007_03_01_1829596	2	In '' Unhooked : How Young Women Pursue Sex , Delay Love and Lose at Both '' ( Riverhead ) , Ms. Sessions Stepp , a Washington Post reporter , writes about how smart , ambitious young women do emotional damage to themselves by getting physical -- making out to having sex -- with men they are not dating or may have met for the first time .
2007_03_01_1829596	3	In the book , which she based on her reporting over the years and a two-year study of nine high school and college students , age 15 to 21 , Ms. Sessions Stepp , 55 , concludes that such encounters have largely replaced dating among high school and college students across the country .
2007_03_01_1829596	4	This culture of sexual aggression , she said , often leaves young women physically and emotionally unsatisfied .
2007_03_01_1829596	5	It leads them to gamble with their health .
2007_03_01_1829596	6	And by never taking the time to get to know and care about one man , she said , young women may be rendering themselves incapable of forging stable , loving relationships . ''
2007_03_01_1829596	7	They 've got the head stuff , they 've got the body stuff down , '' Ms. Sessions Stepp said this week in Washington . ''
2007_03_01_1829596	8	It 's matters of the heart where I think they could be smarter .
2007_03_01_1829596	9	And that was the piece I hoped I could help them think through . ''
2007_03_01_1829596	10	To critics , the book , which was published on Feb. 15 , is an odd throwback -- not only retro in its point of view , but also out of sync with the current climate of high-achieving girls who are usually applauded for focusing on their careers and their female friends , rather than on finding Mr. Right .
2007_03_01_1829596	11	Salon.com likened '' Unhooked '' to a '' 50s-style handbook on appropriate femininity . ''
2007_03_01_1829596	12	Slate magazine said it is alarmist and '' makes sex into a bigger , scarier and more dangerous thing than it already is . ''
2007_03_01_1829596	13	A review in The Washington Post by Kathy Dobie , the author of '' The Only Girl in the Car , '' said that Ms. Sessions Stepp '' resurrects the ugly , old notion of sex as something a female gives in return for a male 's good behavior . ''
2007_03_01_1829596	14	Many of the critics do not question that hooking up is common in the age group that Ms. Sessions Stepp singles out .
2007_03_01_1829596	15	In fact , while studies show that fewer teenagers are having sex , other studies of students at individual universities show that the hookup is the predominant way that students sexually interact .
2007_03_01_1829596	16	But no studies draw a line between the hookup culture and either clinical depression or a lifetime of remaining single , the critics point out .
2007_03_01_1829596	17	Ms. Sessions Stepp said she agrees that some women are able to hop out of bed the morning after a hookup , feel great about themselves and think , '' That was cool , now I 'm going off to chemistry . ''
2007_03_01_1829596	18	And if that is so , she said , that is fine with her .
2007_03_01_1829596	19	But , according to her research , most young women do not happily untangle themselves from the sheets and hightail it to class , she said .
2007_03_01_1829596	20	Instead they obsessively check their cellphones to see if Mr. One Night Only called .
2007_03_01_1829596	21	They feel bad about themselves and lose the opportunity to learn how to build a relationship .
2007_03_01_1829596	22	That they are high achieving is not the point , she said .
2007_03_01_1829596	23	Ms. Sessions Stepp said , in the quest to get ahead , women have put their hearts on hold . ''
2007_03_01_1829596	24	But at what cost ? ''
2007_03_01_1829596	25	Do you want to harden your heart to the point where you do n't know how to feel when you 're ready to get into a relationship ? ''
2007_03_01_1829596	26	Strangely , as her ideas have been derided by advocates for sexual freedom , traditional family values groups have not yet weighed in .
2007_03_01_1829596	27	For her part , Ms. Sessions Stepp said she is hardly an antifeminist : '' People do n't know me , or what I fought for for so many years . ''
2007_03_01_1829596	28	Ms. Sessions Stepp , who won a Pulitzer in 1981 as an editor on a series on brown lung disease , said she helped fight for equal pay early in her career , when she discovered that women journalists at The Philadelphia Evening Bulletin were being paid less than male counterparts .
2007_03_01_1829596	29	She said she divides the housework with her husband , a college professor .
2007_03_01_1829596	30	In college , she worked to eradicate single-sex dorms .
2007_03_01_1829596	31	Equality was a part of her upbringing , she said .
2007_03_01_1829596	32	Her father was a minister who advocated for integration in the South and her mother was among the first women to earn a Ph.D. in psychology in Arkansas .
2007_03_01_1829596	33	Perhaps that is why she seems to take chilly reviews in stride . ''
2007_03_01_1829596	34	I understand their anger because in this current political climate women 's choices are being threatened , '' she said , '' the right to choose an abortion , the right to live with a same-sex partner . ''
2007_03_01_1829596	35	It has led many women to be wary of any suggestion of limits on their lifestyle choices , she said .
2007_03_01_1829596	36	The outburst of criticism has exposed a generational divide between Ms. Sessions Stepp , whose battles for women 's rights focused mainly on equality in the workplace rather than in the bedroom , and some members of a younger generation who equate feminism with sexual freedom .
2007_03_01_1829596	37	Ms. Sessions Stepp said that she welcomes criticism , though not from people who have not read the book or who have never conducted research . ''
2007_03_01_1829596	38	This is what I love about the bloggers , '' she said . ''
2007_03_01_1829596	39	They have n't been out there interviewing young people for 10 years .
2007_03_01_1829596	40	They 're talking about their own college experience .
2007_03_01_1829596	41	Everyone 's had some sort of sexual experience and they all think they 're experts on it . ''
2007_03_01_1829596	42	Ms. Sessions Stepp 's dating experiences in high school , like those of other women of her generation , could be described as traditional .
2007_03_01_1829596	43	Boys picked her up on her doorstep .
2007_03_01_1829596	44	Some gave her friendship rings ( which her father then made her return ) .
2007_03_01_1829596	45	There remains , in the way she carries her slender frame , an air of old-fashioned femininity .
2007_03_01_1829596	46	She wishes more young people would embrace dating and romance ( the better to get to know each other ) .
2007_03_01_1829596	47	She wants women to feel free to express their femininity ( lipstick and heels , why not ? ) .
2007_03_01_1829596	48	And she thinks the best sex is with someone you love , not someone you just met in a keg line . ''
2007_03_01_1829596	49	Real power is not giving it away , but using it wisely , '' Ms. Sessions Stepp said . ''
2007_03_01_1829596	50	That 's when you 're liberated , really . ''
2007_03_01_1829596	51	Her son , Jeff Stepp , 22 , who thinks '' Unhooked '' is on target and gave his mother access to his friends and an ex-girlfriend for it , said the hookup culture is not necessarily bad for everyone . ''
2007_03_01_1829596	52	She argues a good relationship can not stem from a hookup because you 're putting the sex before the feelings , '' he said of his mother . ''
2007_03_01_1829596	53	I was arguing that it can and it has for me . '' ''
2007_03_01_1829596	54	I 'm just a little more liberal in my thinking , '' he said , though he added that hooking up is '' not the optimal way '' to kick off a relationship .
2007_03_01_1829596	55	Miriam Datskovsky , 22 , a senior at Columbia University who documented the sex lives of her peers for two and half years in her Sexplorations column for The Columbia Spectator , said she sees two type of relationships on campus : hooking up or intense monogamous relationships known as the '' college marriage . ''
2007_03_01_1829596	56	Dating exists , though only among older students , she said .
2007_03_01_1829596	57	While hookups obviously pose problems for certain students , the sky is not falling , she said . ''
2007_03_01_1829596	58	As an overall thing , I do n't think there 's anything to be concerned about , '' Ms. Datskovsky said . ''
2007_03_01_1829596	59	College is the time when you make most of your mistakes . ''
2007_03_01_1829596	60	But Mary Yeotsas , a Barnard senior , said that dating is more emotionally satisfying than merely hooking up . ''
2007_03_01_1829596	61	You feel you can sit down and have a conversation with someone , '' said Ms. Yeotsas , 21 , '' and they are interested in what you 're saying , instead of having a drunken conversation at a party that could end in the back of somebody 's room . ''
2007_03_01_1829596	62	The quaint joy of being wooed is not among the most griped-about elements of '' Unhooked . ''
2007_03_01_1829596	63	That distinction belongs to this paragraph : '' Tying one on can be fun occasionally .
2007_03_01_1829596	64	Just do n't let it take over your social life .
2007_03_01_1829596	65	Organize weekend getaways and other events to bring people together .
2007_03_01_1829596	66	Bake cookies , brownies , muffins .
2007_03_01_1829596	67	Ask your girlfriends for assistance .
2007_03_01_1829596	68	Guys will do anything for homemade baked goods . ''
2007_03_01_1829596	69	Ms. Sessions Stepp said she anticipated fallout from those lines , but was simply pointing out there are other things to do for fun . ''
2007_03_01_1829596	70	I said to my editor , ` Should I use that line ? ' ''
2007_03_01_1829596	71	Ms. Sessions Stepp said . ''
2007_03_01_1829596	72	He said , ` Well , it 's going to get some people mad , but you know what ?
2007_03_01_1829596	73	We like controversy . '
2007_03_01_1829596	74	So I said , ` Well , O.K. , just so they do n't ignore my book . ' ''
2007_03_01_1829596	75	Meghan O'Rourke , the literary editor of Slate magazine , who reviewed '' Unhooked , '' said the baking advocacy paragraph '' seemed an unusually starkly old fashioned moment . ''
2007_03_01_1829596	76	Yet the book has a bigger flaw , she said .
2007_03_01_1829596	77	Namely : '' Why talk only about women ? ''
2007_03_01_1829596	78	( Ms. Sessions Stepp said it is because women are the sexual gatekeepers . )
2007_03_01_1829596	79	In the end , Ms. O'Rourke was not convinced hooking up '' was as pervasive and damaging across the board '' as '' Unhooked '' suggests . ''
2007_03_01_1829596	80	We tend to romanticize a safer past , '' she said , '' and to invoke a really dangerous and threatening present . ''
2007_03_01_1829596	81	This may be why some critics of Ms. Sessions Stepp portray her as a disapproving mother figure tut-tutting the perils of unchecked lust .
2007_03_01_1829596	82	She prefers to cast herself as a benevolent guide , from an older generation of feminism , who deeply cares about today 's bright young women .
2007_03_01_1829596	83	In an e-mail message sent to Ms. Sessions Stepp , a senior at Tulane who bought '' Unhooked '' at the university bookstore said , '' I felt like you were almost writing my story . ''
2007_03_01_1829596	84	Ms. Sessions Stepp said her goal is to retool , not reject , feminism . ''
2007_03_01_1829596	85	Really , when you look at it , hookup culture is gravy for guys , '' she said . ''
2007_03_01_1829596	86	So how much are we winning ? ''

2007_03_01_1829604	4	MARIANNE ROHRLICH CURRENTS : WHO KNEW ?
2007_03_01_1829606	0	It has become accepted wisdom that building a great orchestra is a long-term process .
2007_03_01_1829606	1	But as the thrilling all-Shostakovich concert by the New World Symphony at Carnegie Hall on Tuesday night made clear , the slow-and-steady approach is not the only route to orchestral greatness .
2007_03_01_1829606	2	This select training ensemble of top-tier players , mostly in their 20s , bills itself as America 's Orchestral Academy .
2007_03_01_1829606	3	Since founding the New World Symphony in 1987 , the conductor Michael Tilson Thomas has been its devoted artistic director .
2007_03_01_1829606	4	The players pass through the academy , based in Miami Beach , in appointments that typically last no more than three years .
2007_03_01_1829606	5	So its personnel are continually changing .
2007_03_01_1829606	6	Still , the orchestra 's performance here showed what can be accomplished expediently when ambitious , unjaded and highly gifted young musicians work with a dynamic conductor who is also a born teacher .
2007_03_01_1829606	7	The players come from diverse backgrounds , but they work together , study together , and even live together , rent free , in two converted hotels in Miami Beach .
2007_03_01_1829606	8	Their compatibility is spiked with a healthy jolt of competitiveness , since they regularly audition for a limited number of orchestra jobs .
2007_03_01_1829606	9	Mr. Thomas and his charges have another advantage over professional orchestras : no union rules regulate the work week .
2007_03_01_1829606	10	The players can be rehearsed as much as necessary .
2007_03_01_1829606	11	It is no wonder that leading soloists are drawn to playing with this impressive orchestra , among them the cellist Yo-Yo Ma , who offered a moody and rapturously beautiful account of Shostakovich 's Cello Concerto No. 2 on this occasion .
2007_03_01_1829606	12	Somewhat impishly Mr. Thomas started the program by showing off his orchestra in three brash and bleakly comic short dances from Shostakovich 's early ballet score '' The Golden Age , '' played with incisive attack , exuberance and cool technical command .
2007_03_01_1829606	13	The most revealing performance , after intermission , was of Shostakovich 's Symphony No. 5 .
2007_03_01_1829606	14	This work generally comes across as permeated with unnerving ambiguity .
2007_03_01_1829606	15	Does the music 's harmonically tamer and populist style represent the composer 's cave-in to the 1936 denunciation from the Soviet mouthpiece Pravda over the audacious modernism of his earlier work ?
2007_03_01_1829606	16	Or are the symphony 's episodes of poignant longing and brutish vigor , capped by a suspiciously triumphant final flourish , meant to be taken as bitterly ironic ?
2007_03_01_1829606	17	I have seldom heard such a fascinatingly unambiguous performance as this arresting account .
2007_03_01_1829606	18	From the opening of the first movement , with the somber , two-part contrapuntal statement in a sharply dotted rhythm , the playing was emphatic and frank .
2007_03_01_1829606	19	The heavy-footed Scherzo had lacerating power .
2007_03_01_1829606	20	The anguished slow movement was shaped with affecting understatement .
2007_03_01_1829606	21	In the finale Mr. Thomas elicited steely and ferocious playing from the excited players .
2007_03_01_1829606	22	Throughout the performance , every time I began to fear that Mr. Thomas was pushing the players too far , going for blasting power at the expense of subtlety , something amazingly nuanced would happen , like the near-perfect voicing and unshakably steady intonation of the subdued string chords during the poignant ending of the slow movement .
2007_03_01_1829606	23	The orchestra showed even more depth in the concerto .
2007_03_01_1829606	24	As Mr. Ma played the searching ruminations of the first movement with rich tone and overwhelming vulnerability , the orchestra was attentive to his every shift and turn .
2007_03_01_1829606	25	After the jazzy and fidgety second movement , when the third movement began with a fractured brass fanfare , Mr. Ma conveyed that we were entering unhinged emotional terrain , continuing right through the final Allegretto , which seemed like some strangely quizzical march .
2007_03_01_1829606	26	When the performance ended , Mr. Ma acted as if his role were to lead the audience 's ovation for the orchestra .
2007_03_01_1829606	27	He shook hands with and hugged every player he could reach .
2007_03_01_1829606	28	There was an encore : an arrangement of a slow movement from a Tchaikovsky string quartet , during which the inspired New World players utterly matched the elegiac beauty of Mr. Ma 's playing , which is saying a lot .
2007_03_01_1829607	0	The Bird and the Bee is a small-bore pop group built around two people , the singer Inara George and the multi-instrumentalist Greg Kurstin .
2007_03_01_1829607	1	But it performs its gigs , as it did at Joe 's Pub on Monday , with a rhythm section and the kitsch detail of two backup singers wearing hair bows and pale yellow dresses .
2007_03_01_1829607	2	The band 's music descends from the highest level of 1960s and '70s pop songwriting , from sources like Burt Bacharach , Brian Wilson , Jimmy Webb , the Zombies and the Bee Gees .
2007_03_01_1829607	3	In songs like '' Birds and the Bees '' and more so '' I 'm a Broken Heart , '' Mr. Kurstin uses chord changes to turn the song 's atmosphere inside out and make the listener feel internally rearranged .
2007_03_01_1829607	4	It 's skillful , but you know what he 's studied .
2007_03_01_1829607	5	Likewise , the music carries precise touches of archaic or low-rent sound to transmit knowingness : a fuzz guitar sample , a mentholated electric-piano tone or the plastic toy instrument from the '80s , the Omnichord .
2007_03_01_1829607	6	At Joe 's Pub Ms. George , who was dressed in what looked like a giant cake-icing bag , pushed slightly sexy words through a slightly inflexible soprano .
2007_03_01_1829607	7	With some quiet , effective drums , the music came out domestic , smooth , muscle relaxing .
2007_03_01_1829607	8	This band is Los Angeles to the core , and if you 've read any early Joan Didion , you know the plot in advance : there are sinister energies beneath every sunny , positive musical gesture .
2007_03_01_1829607	9	As sparkly as Mr. Kurstin 's arrangements are , they have no warmth ; they 're frozen vacuity .
2007_03_01_1829607	10	And there 's a cold loathing in Ms. George 's lyrics when you draw closer to them .
2007_03_01_1829607	11	( '' A pretty idiot is kissing/Everyone she does n't know '' ; '' And when I 'm tired , I am so very tired/And when it 's done , it 's like I 've killed someone . '' )
2007_03_01_1829607	12	When she shakes down a man for his attention while promising her own -- '' I would be so winning/so absolutely winning/a guarantee in melody/a promise in the sky '' -- you do n't believe her for a second .
2007_03_01_1829607	13	( Not in that dress . )
2007_03_01_1829607	14	This kind of duality can be brought off in a book or a record ( like the band 's handsomely produced album on Metro Blue ) , but it may be too fragile for the stage .
2007_03_01_1829607	15	At least that was the case Monday .
2007_03_01_1829607	16	The core of the music was secure and professional , with Mr. Kurstin on keyboards , Gus Seyffert on guitar and Joey Waronker on a drum kit .
2007_03_01_1829607	17	But Ms. George 's singing ran aground on her high notes , and the banana-colored backup singers , Willow Geer and Alex Lilly , did n't help .
2007_03_01_1829607	18	Their bland voices , badly coordinated stage movements and limp attempts at robot dancing in '' Because '' were almost acts of hostility .
2007_03_01_1829608	0	Waxing philosophical about the passage of time seems altogether too grandmotherly for a critic in the prime of her life .
2007_03_01_1829608	1	Yet on several occasions in recent weeks , works of art have made me feel I was just too old to care about 20-somethings who needlessly complicate their lives and relationships .
2007_03_01_1829608	2	One of those works was Anna Ziegler 's play '' BFF '' ( that 's '' best friends forever , '' for anyone too old to recognize the acronym ) , at the DR2 Theater . ''
2007_03_01_1829608	3	BFF '' smacks of an after-school special .
2007_03_01_1829608	4	The action flips back and forth between vignettes of a friendship between two young girls , starting around age 11 , and the life of one of the girls , Lauren ( played by Sasha Eden , a founder of the theater company WET , which produced this show ) , 10 years later .
2007_03_01_1829608	5	When they 're young , Lauren and Eliza ( Laura Heisler ) are best friends forever ; Eliza 's father has died ; the girls are maturing at different speeds ; Lauren throws Eliza over in a classic example of '' mean girl '' syndrome ; Eliza falls apart .
2007_03_01_1829608	6	Years later Lauren , calling herself Eliza , starts to get involved with Seth ( Jeremy Webb ) but is oddly unable to commit : her past is haunting her .
2007_03_01_1829608	7	It is certainly possible to make fine art out of childhood experiences , but this play , developed in the Sundance Institute Theater Lab , just feels juvenile .
2007_03_01_1829608	8	It also strains credulity right from the first scene , when the two girls start musing on how the time will fly until they are grown up .
2007_03_01_1829608	9	This is the language of adult nostalgia , not of two girls hanging out on a dock in summer .
2007_03_01_1829608	10	The characters are set in motion more according to a psychology textbook than psychological credibility .
2007_03_01_1829608	11	Lots of symptoms are convincingly displayed , but it was hard for me to believe they would lead to the extreme breakdowns the play forces on them .
2007_03_01_1829608	12	The actors did their best , particularly Ms. Heisler , playing a quirky , confused kid not quite ready to grow up .
2007_03_01_1829608	13	All three did a good job of evoking childhood , even Mr. Webb , playing a character in his 20s with the puppylike mien of a much younger person .
2007_03_01_1829608	14	Young : I tend to apply that word to myself .
2007_03_01_1829608	15	But I was too old to appreciate this play . ''
2007_03_01_1829608	16	BFF '' continues through March 24 at the DR2 Theater , 103 East 15th Street , Manhattan ; (212) 239-6200 .
2007_03_01_1829609	0	There was a moment in the concert by the German soprano Simone Kermes and members of the Venice Baroque Orchestra on Tuesday night at Weill Recital Hall when you might have thought you 'd mistakenly wandered into an after-hours jam session at a jazz club .
2007_03_01_1829609	1	It came after intermission , when the musicians ambled out and began playing seemingly spontaneously .
2007_03_01_1829609	2	Ms. Kermes , behind the harpsichord , offered a bit of conversational recitative .
2007_03_01_1829609	3	Strolling to the front of the stage she proceeded to raise the roof with a stormy solo : '' Siam navi all ` onde algenti , '' an aria from Vivaldi 's opera '' L'Olimpiade . ''
2007_03_01_1829609	4	Ms. Kermes had already revealed her estimable gifts in Vivaldi 's cantata '' In furore iustissimae irae , '' which concluded the first half of the program .
2007_03_01_1829609	5	Draped in shimmering metallic silk and crowned with iridescent red hair , she handled the furiously intricate figurations of the first and third sections with astonishing accuracy and agility .
2007_03_01_1829609	6	In between was a recitative and aria of melting beauty , in which Ms. Kermes 's voice came in gently floated high notes and breathy sobs of pious grief .
2007_03_01_1829609	7	If anything curtailed Ms. Kermes 's exuberance , it was the score she was clutching .
2007_03_01_1829609	8	Freed of that encumbrance in the arias she sang in the second half , she performed with a vivid physicality like that of Cecilia Bartoli .
2007_03_01_1829609	9	Occasionally , before an especially ferocious passage , Ms. Kermes bit her lower lip and stuck out her chin . ''
2007_03_01_1829609	10	You ai n't heard nothin ' yet , '' the gesture seemed to say .
2007_03_01_1829609	11	The Venice musicians , led from the harpsichord by Andrea Marcon , accompanied Ms. Kermes with their customary verve and flexibility .
2007_03_01_1829609	12	In '' Gelido in ogni vena , '' from '' Farnace , '' they conjured suitably icy tones in passages Vivaldi adapted from the '' Winter '' concerto of his '' Four Seasons . ''
2007_03_01_1829609	13	In instrumental works by that composer , Corelli and Uccellini , they produced boisterous , rustic sounds .
2007_03_01_1829609	14	Three encores were provided , beginning with a rapt rendition of '' Dido 's Lament '' from Purcell 's '' Dido and Aeneas . ''
2007_03_01_1829609	15	A surreal version of '' Surabaya Johnny , '' from Brecht and Weill 's '' Happy End , '' suggested the cabaret chanteuse Ute Lemper backed by a village string band .
2007_03_01_1829609	16	One last Vivaldi aria , '' Agitata da due venti '' from '' Griselda , '' offered a parting burst of electricity .
2007_03_01_1829610	0	The Broadway-country-gospel singer Lari White pulled a fast one in the opening moments of her New York cabaret debut in the Oak Room of the Algonquin Hotel on Tuesday evening .
2007_03_01_1829610	1	Bouncing onto the stage Ms. White delivered a jingly ode to '' country sunshine '' that augured an evening of forced cheer and perky homilies .
2007_03_01_1829610	2	When she suddenly broke it off to announce how exhausting it was to do '' the down-home Southern hospitality thing , '' you could almost hear the audience 's collective '' whew ! ''
2007_03_01_1829610	3	Ms. White , who comes from what she calls a '' fire-and-brimstone '' Baptist background in Florida and is now based in Nashville , starred in the short-lived Johnny Cash Broadway musical '' Ring of Fire . ''
2007_03_01_1829610	4	She became the unlikely darling of an urban niche market after her acclaimed appearances in the Broadway by the Year series and the Broadway Cabaret Festival .
2007_03_01_1829610	5	Her country-gospel medleys of songs from '' Yentl , '' which she described as '' Baptist shiksa '' during two recent tributes to the lyricists Alan and Marilyn Bergman , have elicited enthusiastic ovations .
2007_03_01_1829610	6	Ms. White , who was accompanied by Don Rebic on piano and Steve Doyle on bass , is a belter .
2007_03_01_1829610	7	Her interpretive savvy keeps her on the right side of the '' American Idol '' approach to country , in which voices that are big and bland are valued over those with stronger personalities .
2007_03_01_1829610	8	In other words , she knows when to say when and relax into a storytelling mode .
2007_03_01_1829610	9	On Tuesday her impulse to be natural found its most focused expression in Carol Hall 's '' Doatsy Mae '' from '' The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas , '' whose title character is a waitress daydreaming about what her life might have been like had she dared to be less respectable .
2007_03_01_1829610	10	A Richard Rodgers sequence culminated with a rendition of '' A Cockeyed Optimist '' that , while lacking the hard twang and grit of Reba McEntire 's version in a recent concert version of '' South Pacific , '' reinforced the notion that the role of Nellie Forbush would be ideal for a country singer .
2007_03_01_1829610	11	I would bet that sooner or later Ms. White will find herself on a stage somewhere washing that man right out of her hair .
2007_03_01_1829610	12	Lari White performs through Saturday at the Oak Room of the Algonquin Hotel , 59 West 44th Street , Manhattan ; (212) 419-9331 .
2007_03_01_1829611	0	Scott Sigler writes science-fiction horror novels , the kind one fan called '' steel-tipped boot on your throat , speed-metal fiction . ''
2007_03_01_1829611	1	Mr. Sigler has written four such books , though not many people have actually read them .
2007_03_01_1829611	2	How many have listened to them , though , is a different story .
2007_03_01_1829611	3	Several times a week Mr. Sigler , 37 , steps into a walk-in closet in his San Francisco home .
2007_03_01_1829611	4	He reads into a microphone that connects to his computer via a sound mixer .
2007_03_01_1829611	5	Hanging shirts envelop him , masking ambient sound .
2007_03_01_1829611	6	After being snubbed by publishers for years , Mr. Sigler began recording his first book , '' EarthCore , '' in 2005 .
2007_03_01_1829611	7	He offered it as a podcast in 22 episodes ( roughly 45 minutes each ) that he posted online and sent free to subscribers for downloading .
2007_03_01_1829611	8	Before long , Mr. Sigler had 5,000 listeners ; by the time he finished releasing his second novel , '' Ancestor , '' last January , he had 30,000 , as he does for '' The Rookie , '' which is playing now .
2007_03_01_1829611	9	With initial printings of novelists ' first books running as low as 2,000 copies , Mr. Sigler has a substantial audience , enough finally to attract a small Canadian publisher , Dragon Moon Press , which published '' EarthCore '' in 2005 and will release '' Ancestor '' on April 1 .
2007_03_01_1829611	10	Mr. Sigler also recently signed with a New York agent , Byrd Leavell of the Waxman Agency , who expects to park his latest , '' Infection , '' with a major publisher .
2007_03_01_1829611	11	Others have turned to the Internet to build their audience , including Cory Doctorow , who offered the text of '' Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom '' as a free download in 2003 .
2007_03_01_1829611	12	But Mr. Sigler is among the vanguard of authors stapling their literary aspirations to the iPod . ''
2007_03_01_1829611	13	A lot of no-name authors like me are getting massive grass-roots exposure , and some of us are going to percolate to the top and get on the best-seller list , '' Mr. Sigler said .
2007_03_01_1829611	14	The business is brewing at Podiobooks.com , the Web site founded in late 2005 with just 15 titles , including books by Tee Morris and Mark Jeffrey , who began offering podcasts about the same time as Mr. Sigler .
2007_03_01_1829611	15	The site was founded by Evo Terra , who wrote the book on podcasting , literally ; he was co-author of '' Podcasting for Dummies . ''
2007_03_01_1829611	16	Today the Web site has about 100 titles , many science fiction and fantasy . ''
2007_03_01_1829611	17	Most of the science-fiction authors are more tech savvy than romance authors , '' Mr. Terra said .
2007_03_01_1829611	18	Podiobooks features primarily unpublished writers , and has rejected books only because of '' hate speech , '' Mr. Terra said .
2007_03_01_1829611	19	The site also includes guidelines on recording a book . ''
2007_03_01_1829611	20	Compared to audiobooks these authors break every rule in the business , including using sound effects , '' Mr. Terra said .
2007_03_01_1829611	21	The podcast books also use music and a full cast more liberally than traditional audiobooks .
2007_03_01_1829611	22	Still , what Podiobooks ' offerings might lack in polish , they tend to make up for in brash enthusiasm .
2007_03_01_1829611	23	Mr. Terra plans to add some fee books by more established authors , and for now covers costs through suggested donations of $ 9.99 per title ( some give more , as much as $ 50 ) , with Podiobooks taking 25 percent and passing the rest to its authors . ''
2007_03_01_1829611	24	There was one that I really enjoyed , and I think I gave them 20 bucks , '' said Martha Cox , a subscriber who listens during her 45-minute commute to Austin , Tex. .
2007_03_01_1829611	25	Most titles are '' very entertaining , and it does n't put me off that publishing companies have decided not to publish them , '' she said . ''
2007_03_01_1829611	26	There 's certainly substandard work available , but there is in bookstores too . ''
2007_03_01_1829611	27	Mr. Jeffrey founded three Internet companies , selling the latest one in 2004 , the same year he completed his Harry Potter-esque fantasy novel , '' The Pocket and the Pendant . ''
2007_03_01_1829611	28	In early 2005 he released it as a podcast . ''
2007_03_01_1829611	29	I 'm just completely impatient with the publishing world , '' he said . ''
2007_03_01_1829611	30	Even if a publisher said yes tomorrow , it would be a full year before the book was in the marketplace .
2007_03_01_1829611	31	Coming from the Internet , that was just insane to me . ''
2007_03_01_1829611	32	Along with drawing about 20,000 listeners , Mr. Jeffrey self-published it through the print-on-demand company Lulu.com .
2007_03_01_1829611	33	( Unlike traditional vanity presses , Lulu does n't require writers to pay for a large printing up front , but prints copies as they sell . )
2007_03_01_1829611	34	Did Mr. Jeffrey think there was a taint to giving away an audio version of his book ? ''
2007_03_01_1829611	35	I come from the Internet , '' he said . ''
2007_03_01_1829611	36	Doing it yourself is the culture .
2007_03_01_1829611	37	And I thought , ` I 'll do the first book this way and build an audience and hopefully make money on the back end . ' ''
2007_03_01_1829611	38	Mr. Jeffrey said that he is evaluating three Hollywood offers for '' The Pocket and the Pendant , '' the big screen , and that his suitors include companies with publishing arms offering book deals . ''
2007_03_01_1829611	39	It 's a much more attractive package to the publisher if you have a built-in audience , '' said Mr. Leavell , the agent , who along with Mr. Sigler represents others who have built Internet followings , including Tucker Max , who detailed his drunken exploits on his Web site before publishing the best seller '' I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell . ''
2007_03_01_1829611	40	Gwen Gedes , publisher of Dragon Moon Press , which published Mr. Sigler 's first and forthcoming book , said that about half of her roughly 70 authors are available on podcasts .
2007_03_01_1829611	41	The possibility that listeners might not buy books after hearing them free does not faze Ms. Gedes , who said the exposure alone is invaluable .
2007_03_01_1829611	42	She has been approaching unsigned podcasters with book deals . ''
2007_03_01_1829611	43	It 's kind of a role reversal to knock on an author 's door , to write a query letter asking , ` Can I be your publisher ? ' ''
2007_03_01_1829611	44	One author she courted was J. C. Hutchins , a 32-year-old former newspaper reporter from Deerfield Beach , Fla. .
2007_03_01_1829611	45	When Mr. Hutchins completed his first novel in a planned trilogy , '' 7th Son , '' in 2005 , he sent the book to agents , since major publishing houses will not consider unrepresented writers . ''
2007_03_01_1829611	46	I got about 35 rejections from agents , '' Mr. Hutchins said . ''
2007_03_01_1829611	47	Most hard-core writers would probably scoff at the mere 35 rejections and say : ` Wait till you get a hundred .
2007_03_01_1829611	48	It builds character . ' ''
2007_03_01_1829611	49	Instead of waiting Mr. Hutchins plunked down $ 50 for a microphone and $ 50 for a mixer and started producing podcasts on GarageBand , the sound-mixing software .
2007_03_01_1829611	50	He put the book 's first episode , the prologue , on Podiobooks in early 2005 .
2007_03_01_1829611	51	And he waited . ''
2007_03_01_1829611	52	You can see the statistic of how many listeners are downloading the book , and for the prologue there were literally three people , and two of them were my girlfriend and myself . ''
2007_03_01_1829611	53	But Mr. Hutchins 's audience grew steadily , and there are now 20,000 people listening to his current feed , the trilogy 's second book '' 7th Son : Deceit . ''
2007_03_01_1829611	54	While Mr. Hutchins said that he appreciated Ms. Gedes 's interest in the book , he is looking for an agent anew in the hope of attracting a bigger publisher .
2007_03_01_1829611	55	Attracting an Internet audience has been validating , but it all comes down to '' the dad test , '' Mr. Hutchins said . ''
2007_03_01_1829611	56	My Dad is n't technically savvy , and he is n't online .
2007_03_01_1829611	57	When he hears Amazon , he thinks of the jungle .
2007_03_01_1829611	58	It would be nice for my Dad to be able to be able to walk into a Barnes & Noble and see at least one copy of my book . ''

2007_03_01_1829614	3	Under ordinary circumstances , he might be admired for the cool precision and contemplative allure of his impressive debut .
2007_03_01_1829614	4	But this is no tyro : Mr. Black is the Irish author John Banville , winner of the Man Booker Prize in 2005 for '' The Sea '' and a man much admired for the hauteur and inventiveness of his fiction .

2007_03_01_1829614	6	So calibrate any assessment of '' Christine Falls '' according to Mr. Banville 's exalted standards for his own work .
2007_03_01_1829614	7	This seems to be his idea of an ordinary book , but it would not be anyone else 's .
2007_03_01_1829614	8	Already published to great astonishment in the Britain , where Mr. Banville 's enigmatic aura and serious literary ambitions seem to have made it shocking that he would write in a conventional style ( albeit one inspired by Georges Simenon ) , '' Christine Falls '' is crossover fiction of a very high order .
2007_03_01_1829614	9	Its mystery plot , while by no means lacking conviction ( this is meant to be the start of a series ) , is frequently upstaged by the aptness and beauty of its insinuating visions .
2007_03_01_1829614	10	So when a woman named Sarah tries to maintain a cool distance from the book 's tormented protagonist , Quirke , who has always been futilely in love with her , Sarah 's uninhabited gloves sit between them .
2007_03_01_1829614	11	They look '' as if some otherwise invisible third person at the table were wringing her hands . ''
2007_03_01_1829614	12	And as the complex plot eventually makes its ramifications clear , Sarah says : '' Time is the opposite of space , have you noticed ?
2007_03_01_1829614	13	In space , everything gets more blurred the farther away you get .
2007_03_01_1829614	14	With time it 's different , everything becomes clear . '' ''
2007_03_01_1829614	15	Christine Falls '' has the kind of time span to support that theory .
2007_03_01_1829614	16	Although it is primarily set in the 1950s , its critical events occurred 20 years earlier .
2007_03_01_1829614	17	That was when Malachy Griffin , a judge 's privileged son , and Quirke , an orphan raised in the judge 's Dublin household as a kind of half-brother to Mal , went to Boston and fell in love with two American sisters , themselves the offspring of a powerful patriarch of Irish lineage , Josh Crawford .
2007_03_01_1829614	18	Mal married Sarah , to Quirke 's eternal chagrin .
2007_03_01_1829614	19	Quirke married Delia , the wilder of the two sisters , and perhaps would have found some kind of contentment with her .
2007_03_01_1829614	20	But Delia died in childbirth , and Quirke has been drowning his sorrows ever since .
2007_03_01_1829614	21	He works as a pathologist and is all too comfortable in the company of the dead .
2007_03_01_1829614	22	After a brief , haunting prologue about a baby , '' Christine Falls '' begins with a party at the hospital where Mal and Quirke work .
2007_03_01_1829614	23	( Mal is Dublin 's most sought-after obstetrician , causing Quirke to muse that '' many a boychild born here at the Holy Family Hospital was obliged to venture out upon the obstacle course of life bearing what Quirke was sure would be the not inconsiderable handicap of being named Malachy . '' )
2007_03_01_1829614	24	Also on the premises : the corpse of a young woman . ''
2007_03_01_1829614	25	Christine Falls , '' says Quirke , looking at her toe tag . ''
2007_03_01_1829614	26	You were well named . ''
2007_03_01_1829614	27	And so was her daughter , the mysterious infant from the opening scene .
2007_03_01_1829614	28	When Quirke catches Mal in the act of altering the dead woman 's medical records , the story gets its jump-start .
2007_03_01_1829614	29	But '' Christine Falls , '' for all its plot twists , is not a book governed by its narrative .
2007_03_01_1829614	30	Mr. Banville , a k a Mr. Black , makes his plot almost secondary to the haunted , richly developed characters who ricochet through this suspenseful but unhurried book , all of them full of secrets and all very much products of their time .
2007_03_01_1829614	31	With the novel 's time set by '' some heartsick hillbilly on the cab radio twanging away about hound dogs and lonesomeness and love , '' these are people perched on the edge of sweeping change .
2007_03_01_1829614	32	The Roman Catholic Church affects their lives in ways that would not be so potent in later decades .
2007_03_01_1829614	33	Shame , sexual repression , women 's attitudes toward childbearing and men 's toward philandering are at the heart of the turmoil that the author sets in motion .
2007_03_01_1829614	34	The story 's older women -- especially Rose Crawford , dragon-lady wife of the ancient and ailing Josh , who has paid to have a type of rose named in her honor ( '' the flowers when they come out are a nasty shade of crimson , and have no scent '' ) -- are already prisoners of destiny .
2007_03_01_1829614	35	Sarah , Delia , the book 's assorted and mysterious nuns : all have long since assumed certain roles in life , and during the course of the book Quirke will discover unexpected things about each of them .
2007_03_01_1829614	36	But there are also younger characters , seemingly on the cusp of escape : Sarah and Mal 's daughter , Phoebe , who wants to do the unthinkable and marry a Protestant ; and a young mother named Claire , who adores the cowboy aspect of her tough young husband , Andy .
2007_03_01_1829614	37	Much of the book pivots on what will become of these more mutable figures and , by implication , what will happen to the changing world that awaits them . ''
2007_03_01_1829614	38	Christine Falls '' rolls forward with haunting , sultry exoticism ( '' The quiet in the car seemed to broaden , and something unseen began to grow up out of it and spread its indolent fronds '' ) toward the best kind of denouement under these circumstances : a half-inconclusive one .
2007_03_01_1829614	39	Though Quirke uncovers a '' Chinatown '' - like web of treachery , one that pits the prison of the past against escape and youth , he emerges with his own wounds still festering , his own problems unsolved .
2007_03_01_1829614	40	Quirke leaves readers not at the end of this single story , but poised at what looks like the beginning of a beautiful friendship , as they say in the genre of fiction to which '' Christine Falls '' belongs .
2007_03_01_1829615	0	Q. Are compact fluorescent light bulbs the only energy-saving option ?
2007_03_01_1829615	1	You might try light-emitting diodes , or L.E.D. 's , which give out more light per watt of electricity than compact fluorescent bulbs .
2007_03_01_1829615	2	Light-emitting diodes were invented in the '50s .
2007_03_01_1829615	3	They are semiconductor devices -- a kind of computer chip -- that give off light when current is applied to them .
2007_03_01_1829615	4	Depending on their chemical makeup , they can emit green , blue , red or white light .
2007_03_01_1829615	5	L.E.D. 's are now available with standard screw-type bases , so they can easily replace incandescent or compact fluorescent bulbs in your home .
2007_03_01_1829615	6	They are also sold in '' high-hat , '' or downlighting , fixtures for the ceiling .
2007_03_01_1829615	7	The face of most L.E.D. bulbs looks like a circuit board and the light they put out resembles a cluster of brilliant dots , each about the size of an aspirin tablet .
2007_03_01_1829615	8	An L.E.D. 's light is much whiter than that of a standard incandescent bulb , or even a compact fluorescent bulb , and L.E.D. 's work well on a dimmer or a timer .
2007_03_01_1829615	9	But like spotlights , they cast their light in one direction , so they do n't work in table lamps .
2007_03_01_1829615	10	L.E.D. 's produce about 70 lumens ( the standard measure for light ) per watt , whereas an incandescent bulb produces only 10 to 15 and the compact fluorescent , only about 35 .
2007_03_01_1829615	11	Unlike compact fluorescent bulbs , L.E.D. 's have no mercury , an important environmental consideration because most bulbs end up in landfills .
2007_03_01_1829615	12	L.E.D. 's cost more than either conventional or compact fluorescent bulbs , but they last far longer .
2007_03_01_1829615	13	Whereas the average incandescent bulb costs less than a dollar and a compact fluorescent bulb can sell for a few dollars , some L.E.D. 's run as high as $ 90 a bulb .
2007_03_01_1829615	14	But L.E.D. lights are typically rated as having a lifespan of 30,000 to 50,000 hours .
2007_03_01_1829615	15	So an L.E.D. bulb can last for more than 10 years , if you use it 8 hours a day .
2007_03_01_1829615	16	Compact fluorescents are typically rated at 7,500 to 10,000 hours , and incandescents at about 1,500 hours .
2007_03_01_1829615	17	Rather than burning out as incandescent bulbs do , L.E.D. 's light output dims over tens of thousands of hours .
2007_03_01_1829615	18	L.E.D. 's are also more resistant to vibration than incandescents or screw-in fluorescent bulbs , and do not flicker or hum .
2007_03_01_1829615	19	The city of Raleigh , N.C. , recently announced that it will begin installing L.E.D. 's in some of its streetlights , and if they work well , will consider converting all 33,000 streetlights to L.E.D. , according to Daniel Howe , an assistant city manager .
2007_03_01_1829615	20	Raleigh is using L.E.D. lights made by Cree Inc. , of Durham , N.C. , with components developed by the Lighting Sciences Group , of Dallas , which also makes bulbs for home use , shown above .
2007_03_01_1829615	21	Kim Freeman , a spokeswoman for General Electric , said the company makes L.E.D. 's , but only for commercial uses like outdoor signs , which are often in locations where changing a bulb is difficult .
2007_03_01_1829615	22	But given the high price of L.E.D. 's , she said , the company is focusing '' on the commercial side , '' rather than on making bulbs for home use , although that could change with progress in manufacturing .
2007_03_01_1829615	23	Smaller companies , though , are marketing them for use in the home , and L.E.D. 's are easy to buy on the Internet .
2007_03_01_1829615	24	Jeffrey Harris , a vice president at the Alliance to Save Energy , a Washington , D.C.,-based advocacy group , said , '' L.E.D. lighting represents one of the most promising energy-efficient lighting solutions for the future , '' but costs have to come down before L.E.D. 's will be universally accepted for residential use .
2007_03_01_1829615	25	Exactly how much energy might be saved with widespread use of L.E.D. 's is not clear , but their long life makes them appealing for use in hard-to-reach places .
2007_03_01_1829615	26	They are gaining wide use as Christmas lights , and the Capitol Christmas tree was decorated with 10,000 of them last year .
2007_03_01_1829616	0	Up in a tiny office on the sixth floor of Bellevue Hospital Center sits the most unlikely tenant in this 271-year-old public institution : a fledgling publishing imprint .
2007_03_01_1829616	1	Bellevue Literary Press , set to release its first title in April , is not the only publisher to be operated from a medical center .
2007_03_01_1829616	2	( There is the Cleveland Clinic Press , for one . )
2007_03_01_1829616	3	But given the role that Bellevue Hospital has played in the imagination of New York and the nation , it is perhaps the most curious .
2007_03_01_1829616	4	Erika Goldman , the imprint 's editorial director , acknowledged that Bellevue 's old snake-pit reputation -- as a kind of international symbol for the criminally deranged -- has not entirely been erased from the public consciousness .
2007_03_01_1829616	5	But she said she had tried to push away any psych-ward images since beginning work in her office-within-a-hospital in September 2005 . ''
2007_03_01_1829616	6	Whatever notions I had about people coming to Bellevue in shackles and wild hair have been long ago dispelled , '' Ms. Goldman said . ''
2007_03_01_1829616	7	But coming into a hospital every day to come to my little office and do publishing is a very different experience . ''
2007_03_01_1829616	8	Ms. Goldman , a veteran of New York publishing houses like Simon & Schuster and Charles Scribner 's Sons , is the sole full-time salaried employee of the imprint , which is sponsored by the New York University School of Medicine .
2007_03_01_1829616	9	Along with the publisher , Dr. Jerome Lowenstein , a longtime professor at N.Y.U. , Ms. Goldman selects , edits and supervises the publication of Bellevue Literary Press 's four spring titles , both nonfiction and fiction , all medical or scientific in nature yet written for a general audience .
2007_03_01_1829616	10	Its first title , '' Galileo 's Gout , '' by Dr. Gerald Weissmann , a research professor at the N.Y.U. School of Medicine , is a look at the intersection of science and politics , embryonic stem cell research , the evolution-creationism debate and faith-based medicine in what Dr. Weissmann calls '' an age of endarkenment . ''
2007_03_01_1829616	11	The second book , '' The Cure , '' is a novel set in mid-20th-century America about a family whose son has polio , set to be published in May .
2007_03_01_1829616	12	Following those titles are '' Doctored Drawings '' by Dr. Mark Podwal , a collection of drawings on politics and medicine , and '' Awkward '' by Mary Cappello , cultural criticism about the state of awkwardness .
2007_03_01_1829616	13	( Four more books are planned for the fall season . )
2007_03_01_1829616	14	Dr. Podwal , a clinical associate professor at the N.Y.U. School of Medicine , said he had not bothered shopping his book around to larger trade publishers he has worked with in the past . ''
2007_03_01_1829616	15	I 'm not sure they would have published the book , and certainly the cover would horrify the sales force , '' he said , referring to his drawing of a skeletal hand -- with its fingers converted into medical instruments -- that adorns his front cover .
2007_03_01_1829616	16	The Bellevue Literary Press sprung from the Bellevue Literary Review , a journal that was founded in 2000 .
2007_03_01_1829616	17	Dr. Lowenstein , the journal 's nonfiction editor , recruited private donors to finance the imprint , raising at least $ 500,000 to be doled out over a four-year period .
2007_03_01_1829616	18	The imprint operates on a relatively shoestring budget , paying its authors advances that are usually less than $ 5,000 , Ms. Goldman said . ''
2007_03_01_1829616	19	The types of books we 're publishing are books that we 're proud of , but they 're not commercially oriented books , '' she said . ''
2007_03_01_1829616	20	We do n't have any illusions about making a fortune .
2007_03_01_1829616	21	We 're in it for love and art . ''
2007_03_01_1829616	22	They do not harbor any illusions about the connotations of the Bellevue name either .
2007_03_01_1829616	23	Dr. Podwal said he does believe that members of younger generations '' do n't even have a clue about what Bellevue meant , '' he said .
2007_03_01_1829616	24	But the older generations have not forgotten , he said : '' They just think of Bellevue as a psychiatric ward . ''
2007_03_01_1829617	0	You have a 5-3 spade fit and a 4-4 heart fit .
2007_03_01_1829617	1	Which would you usually select as your trump suit ?
2007_03_01_1829617	2	Suppose you have a 5-4 spade fit and 4-4 heart fit .
2007_03_01_1829617	3	Would that change your answer ?
2007_03_01_1829617	4	When you have a 4-4 fit that is not the trump suit , at best you can win four tricks from it .
2007_03_01_1829617	5	But if it is the trump suit , it will often provide a fifth trick .
2007_03_01_1829617	6	You can probably draw trumps in three rounds and arrange to ruff a loser in one hand or the other to get the extra trick .
2007_03_01_1829617	7	A 5-3 side suit will produce at most five tricks .
2007_03_01_1829617	8	If you make it the trump suit , to gain a sixth trick you must either take a ruff in the shorter trump hand or ruff three times in the longer trump hand , both of which are unlikely .
2007_03_01_1829617	9	So generally you should prefer the 4-4 fit as your trump suit and the 5-3 fit to be a side suit , especially since it may provide useful discards on the fourth and fifth cards .
2007_03_01_1829617	10	There are occasions , though , when the 5-3 fit will make the better trump suit -- in particular when the 5-3 fit is strong , the 4-4 fit weaker and the only concern is not losing trump tricks .
2007_03_01_1829617	11	When you add a ninth card , producing a 5-4 fit , the same considerations apply .
2007_03_01_1829617	12	The diagramed deal provides an example .
2007_03_01_1829617	13	It occurred during the Flight A Swiss Teams on Feb. 18 at the New England Knockout Regional in Cromwell , Conn. .
2007_03_01_1829617	14	The winners were Jeff Aker of Briarcliff , N.Y. ; Bob Feller of Guilderland , N.Y. ; Simon Kantor of Agawam , Mass. ; and Glenn Milgrim of New York .
2007_03_01_1829617	15	They finished less than half a match ahead of Sylwia and Michael McNamara and Benjamin Rottman of White Plains and Lee Ohliger of Ridgewood , N.J. To make a small slam South must lose at most one trick in the majors .
2007_03_01_1829617	16	At the other table South was in six hearts .
2007_03_01_1829617	17	After a club lead to the queen , king and ace , to make his contract declarer had immediately to play a heart to dummy 's nine .
2007_03_01_1829617	18	He was never going to do that and drifted down one .
2007_03_01_1829617	19	Aker ( South ) and Milgrim had the given auction to six spades , the superior slam because their trump suit was stronger .
2007_03_01_1829617	20	Two no-trump was a game-forcing spade raise .
2007_03_01_1829617	21	Three clubs warned of a minimum opening bid .
2007_03_01_1829617	22	Three no-trump announced a singleton club with 14 or 15 high-card points .
2007_03_01_1829617	23	( He did not count the club queen . )
2007_03_01_1829617	24	Four no-trump was Roman Key Card Blackwood , the reply showing two key cards ( one ace and the trump king , or two aces ) and the trump queen .
2007_03_01_1829617	25	South took the first trick with his club ace , drew trumps in two rounds , cashed dummy 's top diamonds , ruffed a diamond in his hand , trumped a club on the board and ruffed a diamond in his hand to give this end position : Now Aker made the play that guaranteed the contract whatever the distribution of the heart suit .
2007_03_01_1829617	26	He led the jack from his hand .
2007_03_01_1829617	27	West did not play his king , so declarer continued with a low heart to dummy 's queen .
2007_03_01_1829617	28	Plus 100 and plus 1,430 gave the winners 17 international match points on the board .
2007_03_01_1829619	0	SHOWER heads used to be fairly standard : a round fixture on the ceiling or wall of a shower that sprayed water on your head -- if you stood in the right place .

2007_03_01_1829620	0	A little past the two-minute mark , the music video for Gwen Stefani 's recent single , '' Wind It Up , '' finds her chained to a fence while a flurry of bubbles and snowflakes float by .
2007_03_01_1829620	1	Viewed from a certain perspective -- that is , through 3-D glasses -- it is a dreamlike moment in which the flurry seems close enough to touch .
2007_03_01_1829620	2	The video begins with Ms. Stefani yodeling , a homage to '' The Sound of Music , '' one of the her favorite films .
2007_03_01_1829620	3	But the idea of adding the bubbles and snow came from an unlikely source : James Cameron , the director behind effects-laden hits like '' The Terminator '' and '' Titanic , '' who visited Ms. Stefani 's set last October and shot a separate version of the video with 3-D equipment . ''
2007_03_01_1829620	4	I had mentioned to the director that any kind of atmospheric effects like snow or rain usually play in 3-D , '' Mr. Cameron recalled .
2007_03_01_1829620	5	While '' Wind It Up '' was not initially planned as a 3-D video , Ms. Stefani probably wo n't be the last recording artist to follow Mr. Cameron 's lead .
2007_03_01_1829620	6	As part of a newly created venture , Mr. Cameron is working with Jimmy Iovine , the chairman of the Interscope Geffen A&M record label , to produce music films , concerts and other content in 3-D to show in specially equipped theaters .
2007_03_01_1829620	7	Mr. Iovine and Mr. Cameron hope to deliver their first production by summer .
2007_03_01_1829620	8	The two acknowledge that they have yet to work out many details : they say they do n't know how many productions will be created or which artists will be featured , but the idea has been discussed with Interscope artists including Marilyn Manson and Nine Inch Nails .
2007_03_01_1829620	9	Many music fans may be too young to recall the last time 3-D was in vogue : the 1980s , when hordes donned flimsy multihued glasses to watch '' Jaws 3 '' and other attractions .
2007_03_01_1829620	10	But the latest version of the technology has Hollywood buzzing again , particularly since 3-D showings of animated fare like '' Chicken Little '' have racked up impressive sales .
2007_03_01_1829620	11	Mr. Cameron is at work on a $ 200 million 3-D feature titled '' Avatar . ''
2007_03_01_1829620	12	Mr. Iovine and Mr. Cameron are aware of the odds of changing consumer behavior .
2007_03_01_1829620	13	They are wagering that fans will be willing to trek to a movie theater and pay perhaps a few dollars more than the price of a regular ticket to see their favorite stars on the big screen and in 3-D .
2007_03_01_1829620	14	The glasses now resemble standard sunglasses , and musicians may be able to make their own designs .
2007_03_01_1829620	15	The venture , led by the film producer Gene Kirkwood , also represents a distinctive take on what both the music-video and the concert can be .
2007_03_01_1829620	16	If it works , the partners said , fans could experience a concert as if they were on stage next to U2 's guitarist , the Edge , or see the members of Kiss in full makeup perform a pyrotechnic show seemingly right in front of them , all for a fraction of the price of seeing a headline act on tour . ''
2007_03_01_1829620	17	What it does is put you , the audience , right there with the performer onstage , in their creative reality , '' Mr. Cameron said recently during a break in production from '' Avatar . '' ''
2007_03_01_1829620	18	The whole idea of a concert may change . ''
2007_03_01_1829620	19	Mr. Iovine and Mr. Cameron have discussed with executives at Harrah 's Entertainment setting up a night club in Las Vegas where visitors would be surrounded by 3-D images and watch 3-D performances , though no deal has been struck .
2007_03_01_1829620	20	Mr. Iovine also said that 3-D performances could become a new way for artists to build ties to their fans and generate much-needed revenue for the ailing music business . ''
2007_03_01_1829620	21	The record industry has to have lots of different revenue streams , and this just looks like one that 's creatively cool , '' Mr. Iovine said . ''
2007_03_01_1829620	22	And you ca n't download it .
2007_03_01_1829620	23	You ca n't get it anyplace else . ''
2007_03_01_1829621	0	Harry Potter Passes a Test Harry Potter did the full monty in the West End , and the critics liked what they saw .
2007_03_01_1829621	1	In other words , Daniel Radcliffe , right , best known for his film portrayals of the boy wizard Harry Potter , received enthusiastic reviews when he opened at the Gielgud Theater in London on Tuesday in a revival of the 1973 Peter Shaffer psychological thriller , '' Equus , '' in which he plays a tortured teenager , a role that requires him to appear in the nude , Reuters reported .
2007_03_01_1829621	2	Excitement surrounding the West End stage debut of Mr. Radcliffe , 17 , helped sell $ 3.9 million worth of tickets before the opening and attracted a galaxy of stars to the first night , including Bob Geldof , Helena Bonham Carter and Christian Slater .
2007_03_01_1829621	3	The play 's co-star is Richard Griffiths ( Harry 's nasty uncle in the films ) , as the psychiatrist who plumbs the teenager 's obsession with horses . ''
2007_03_01_1829621	4	No flash in the magic pan , '' was The Guardian 's assessment of Mr. Radcliffe 's performance .
2007_03_01_1829621	5	The Daily Telegraph said , '' Brilliant Radcliffe throws off Harry Potter 's cloak . ''
2007_03_01_1829621	6	Priceless Greek Icon Found Greek restorers have discovered a priceless 17th-century painting beneath the silver sheet covering a Byzantine icon of St. John the Baptist kept for years in a provincial church , Reuters reported .
2007_03_01_1829621	7	Concealed for centuries beneath the ornate cover , the icon , left , with miniature scenes from St. John 's life , is dated 1646 and signed by Emmanuel Tzanes , a theologian , priest and leading artist of his time , whose works are in museums around the world . ''
2007_03_01_1829621	8	This is very important , '' Georgios A. Voulgarakis , the Greek culture minister , said yesterday . ''
2007_03_01_1829621	9	This icon is recorded for the first time under his name . ''
2007_03_01_1829621	10	Ministry officials said the painting must have been covered by the silver sheet around 1760 , leaving only the faces visible to the faithful who kissed and prayed to it ever since , unaware of its value .
2007_03_01_1829621	11	St. John is shown against a gold background , while 12 scenes from his life , from conception to beheading and burial , line the sides and bottom of the icon .
2007_03_01_1829621	12	Mr. Voulgarakis said that after restoration , the icon would be returned to the church , in Kranidi , a town in the Peloponnese , where it would receive special security .

2007_03_01_1829621	18	The former Phish frontman Trey Anastasio pleaded not guilty on Tuesday in Fort Edward , N.Y. , to felony counts of illegally possessing prescription painkillers and driving while impaired .
2007_03_01_1829621	19	He is also charged with misdemeanors : possession of heroin and an anti-anxiety medication prescribed for someone else .
2007_03_01_1829621	20	Although he faces a maximum of 14 years in prison if convicted on all counts , all the charges carry minimum sentences involving no incarceration .
2007_03_01_1829621	21	His lawyer , Steve Coffey , said Mr. Anastasio , 42 , had a drug problem and was seeking treatment .
2007_03_01_1829621	22	Mr. Anastasio agreed to a pre-plea investigation and is scheduled to return to court on March 27 .
2007_03_01_1829621	23	The country singer Troy Lee Gentry , 39 , of the duo Montgomery Gentry , was required to give up hunting in Minnesota for five years after he was sentenced to three months ' probation and a $ 15,000 fine on Friday for killing a 600-pound captive black bear named Cubby , The Associated Press reported .
2007_03_01_1829621	24	He pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor in November .
2007_03_01_1829621	25	Authorities said that Mr. Gentry videotaped and edited the bow-and-arrow hunt to make it appear that the bear died in a '' fair chase , '' when in fact it was sold for $ 4,650 by Lee Marvin Greenly , who orchestrated the hunt at the 80-acre Minnesota Wildlife Connection near Sandstone , Minn. 92nd Street Y Programs Venture to TriBeCa The 92nd Street Y 's Makor and Daytime programs are headed to TriBeCa from the West Side of Manhattan .

2007_03_01_1829621	27	Kostow Greenwood Architects will design the site .
2007_03_01_1829621	28	The West Side location , at 35 West 67th Street , donated to the Y in 2001 by the philanthropist Michael H. Steinhardt , was sold in September to the City University of New York , which plans to use it as the home of its Honors College .
2007_03_01_1829621	29	Makor 's cultural programs serve young adults , particularly those on the margins of Jewish life ; Daytime serves retired or semiretired baby boomers .

2007_03_01_1829625	0	IF you ca n't get a meeting with the networks after years of writing for a hit show , and your TV agent fires you and the cowboy lover 10 years your junior has up and left with not even a , '' Well , Toots , it looks like our work here is done '' -- if , finally , you are no longer a voice of the '60s , but marooned in your 60s , you could do worse than Sara Davidson .
2007_03_01_1829625	1	Unable to get work in Los Angeles despite a successful career as a television writer and journalist , she pulled up stakes and moved to Boulder , where she knew no one , to find a new life .
2007_03_01_1829625	2	Her house , in the foothills of the Rockies , cost $ 1.3 million -- a nice piece of change to put down when the subject of your new book is your life 's uncertainty .
2007_03_01_1829625	3	She has a glass-walled office , outside of which the foxes walk by so close she can see the markings on their heads , and a hot tub on the veranda .
2007_03_01_1829625	4	But why did Ms. Davidson , who lives alone , her two children grown , need a nine-room house ? ''
2007_03_01_1829625	5	Yeah , it 's way too big , '' says Ms. Davidson , a tall , slim woman in jeans and a purple T-shirt , who even this side of the Rockies exudes the good-hair vibe of a successful network writer . ''
2007_03_01_1829625	6	Three of the rooms are closed , I never go into them .
2007_03_01_1829625	7	I live in the office and bedroom and visit the kitchen .
2007_03_01_1829625	8	I 'd looked for six months , I wanted a 2,000-square-foot house , one bedroom to sleep in and one to work , but I could n't find one . ''
2007_03_01_1829625	9	Here is the nice thing about being a writer : If you find yourself in a miserable situation , you can come up with a snazzy tag for it and turn it into a book .
2007_03_01_1829625	10	Ms. Davidson , who made her name with the 1977 novel '' Loose Change , '' about three women of the '60s coming of age , has now written '' Leap !
2007_03_01_1829625	11	What Will We Do With the Rest of Our Lives ? ''
2007_03_01_1829625	12	It focuses on a time in life that Ms. Davidson has christened the Narrows , when the old professional and personal identities have been stripped away and one is left in the dark .
2007_03_01_1829625	13	Ms. Davidson , a former writer and producer of '' Dr. Quinn , Medicine Woman , '' chronicles not only her own struggles , but also those of other successful boomers who have found themselves sidelined .
2007_03_01_1829625	14	People who are forced out of jobs in their 50s and never find new ones , or who ca n't afford health insurance , are not discussed .
2007_03_01_1829625	15	This is a book , Ms. Davidson says , about creative and spiritual fulfillment .
2007_03_01_1829625	16	She writes of Carly Simon -- ignored by her record label , unable to afford her Central Park West apartment when the rent tripled -- who went off , recorded on her own and ended up back on the charts .
2007_03_01_1829625	17	An inspirational tale , but given that Ms. Simon 's rent went up from an apparently affordable $ 7,000 to $ 24,000 and her retreat was a second home in Martha 's Vineyard , who 's going to be able to relate ? ''
2007_03_01_1829625	18	Carly Simon had a serious cancer , she and her husband were breaking up , '' Ms. Davidson says . ''
2007_03_01_1829625	19	Mostly it 's being dropped by her record company and being told she 's not commercial .
2007_03_01_1829625	20	There are n't that many celebrities in the book , but there are some .
2007_03_01_1829625	21	The reason is that we have this feeling that the beautiful and rich and successful and someone as wonderful as Carly Simon does n't have to go through what the rest of us have to go through .
2007_03_01_1829625	22	But it happens , no matter how much money you have . ''
2007_03_01_1829625	23	Ms. Davidson , if not technically a boomer at 64 , was certainly a voice of the boomer generation .
2007_03_01_1829625	24	The daughter of a radio repairman in Los Angeles , she graduated from Berkeley and was covering social and political events for Harper 's , Rolling Stone and Life by her late 20s .
2007_03_01_1829625	25	When her first marriage , to the radio host Jonathan Schwartz , ended in divorce , she did not seek alimony -- she was an independent '60s woman , after all . ''
2007_03_01_1829625	26	Loose Change , '' which was in part autobiographical , was made into an NBC miniseries .
2007_03_01_1829625	27	The paperback rights sold for $ 470,000 in 1977 .
2007_03_01_1829625	28	Ms. Davidson 's life was n't charmed .
2007_03_01_1829625	29	There were books that were flops and books that were best sellers ; a second marriage , which produced a son and a daughter , now 25 and 22 ; a second divorce .
2007_03_01_1829625	30	But it was still the conventional Hollywood good life : the architect-designed house in Santa Monica ; the Mercedes ML320 ; the teenage daughter throwing a fit when Ms. Davidson got her eyes done ; the spiritual coaches and quests .
2007_03_01_1829625	31	There was also the unconventional aspect : the cowboy lover who lived in Arizona , paycheck to paycheck , and had never heard of Anne Frank .
2007_03_01_1829625	32	His name was Richard , but in her books she calls him Zack .
2007_03_01_1829625	33	He worked in feed lots and did rawhide braiding .
2007_03_01_1829625	34	One of the reasons she thinks it worked for her , Ms. Davidson says , is that he was a creative person , too .
2007_03_01_1829625	35	He was determined to be the best rawhide braider in the world ; when she struggled with a piece of writing , he understood .
2007_03_01_1829625	36	Ms. Davidson wrote a book about that part of her life , too , a novel called '' Cowboy . ''
2007_03_01_1829625	37	The relationship lasted seven years and was , she says , the most emotionally and physically fulfilling one of her life .
2007_03_01_1829625	38	Read the section of '' Leap '' in which she describes a weekend at a Tantric sex workshop ( page 128 , if you 're pressed for time ) , and you 'll understand why .
2007_03_01_1829625	39	Then in 2000 , when she was 57 , it was all over . ''
2007_03_01_1829625	40	We were supposed to have dinner and he just never showed up , '' Ms. Davidson says . ''
2007_03_01_1829625	41	It took me a month to find him .
2007_03_01_1829625	42	It was the most painful breakup I ever went through .
2007_03_01_1829625	43	All of that closeness and warmth was suddenly gone and there was nothing to replace it with . ''
2007_03_01_1829625	44	Nor could Ms. Davidson , who added her name to a large group of writers who sued the networks claiming age discrimination , bury herself in her work -- for the first time in her life , she could n't get any .
2007_03_01_1829625	45	She tried for three years .
2007_03_01_1829625	46	Finally , a life coach told her to '' lean into '' her feelings , that is , to listen to her instincts .
2007_03_01_1829625	47	When the word '' Boulder '' came into Ms. Davidson 's head , she checked out the city on the Internet and found it had many of the things she wanted : a spiritual community , skiing and hiking trails , and a university where , after a dismissive first interview , she was able to land a teaching job .
2007_03_01_1829625	48	Teaching was not the answer for her -- she did it only for one semester -- but she did get a contract for '' Leap , '' and decided she liked Boulder enough to stay .
2007_03_01_1829625	49	She found her house after renting for two years .
2007_03_01_1829625	50	She loved the work room 's mountain views ; just as much , she loved the house 's move-in condition . ''
2007_03_01_1829625	51	I did n't want to go looking at doorknobs , '' Ms. Davidson says . ''
2007_03_01_1829625	52	I was working intensely .
2007_03_01_1829625	53	I spend all my working hours in my office and that 's the most important room in the house to me .
2007_03_01_1829625	54	Other people look at the master bedroom and kitchen ; I was looking for a place to work . ''
2007_03_01_1829625	55	The house still does not feel as if its occupant has fully put her imprint on it .
2007_03_01_1829625	56	There 's something about it that feels like the owner is just passing through , and indeed she says she doubts she will stay in Boulder forever .
2007_03_01_1829625	57	But for now , she has done what she can with books and family pictures , the Red Grooms on one wall , and an odd piece , a small windmill , in a corner of the living room .
2007_03_01_1829625	58	There 's a funny story about that windmill , Ms. Davidson says .
2007_03_01_1829625	59	It goes back to the time she was working on '' Dr. Quinn '' and involved with Richard the cowboy , Ms. Davidson says .
2007_03_01_1829625	60	She was too busy to shop , but her decorator brought things for her approval .
2007_03_01_1829625	61	One was an '' antique '' windmill from Woodbine , Iowa .
2007_03_01_1829625	62	Ms. Davidson , who thinks she paid about $ 400 for it , loved it .
2007_03_01_1829625	63	The following weekend she and the cowboy , who 'd always spent their time together at her place , agreed it was time for Ms. Davidson to visit him at home in Arizona . ''
2007_03_01_1829625	64	We were both dreading it , '' Ms. Davidson says . ''
2007_03_01_1829625	65	He was afraid of what I would think and I was afraid of what I would think .
2007_03_01_1829625	66	I told him to rent us a motel room .
2007_03_01_1829625	67	As we drove to his place the houses got closer together and shabbier and the people became slightly threatening , seedy .
2007_03_01_1829625	68	We were getting to the low-rent part of town and we passed this yard just covered with junk and an old car , rotting .
2007_03_01_1829625	69	And there was the same windmill , only it was lying on its side ready to be hauled off to the dump . ''
2007_03_01_1829625	70	A little later , she brings up the subject of privilege .
2007_03_01_1829625	71	It 's true that the people she has written about are for the most part financially secure , Ms. Davidson says .
2007_03_01_1829625	72	But the midlife problems she writes about affect everyone . ''
2007_03_01_1829625	73	I got an e-mail from a woman who is living in an RV , '' Ms. Davidson says . ''
2007_03_01_1829625	74	She was in Homeland Security , she got laid off , she drove far away to some beach in Florida where she 's taking a home study course in interior decorating .
2007_03_01_1829625	75	Her friends thought she was crazy .
2007_03_01_1829625	76	We 're all in this and whatever situation we 're in , we 're going to have to figure out how to make it meaningful . ''
2007_03_01_1829625	77	AT HOME WITH : SARA DAVIDSON
2007_03_01_1829627	0	Jean Paul Gaultier opened his Scottish Highlands-cum-cowboy-Western-theme collection with the model Coco Rocha pounding down the runway doing a Celtic dance .
2007_03_01_1829627	1	She wore a double-breasted red coat , but that was beside the point .
2007_03_01_1829627	2	Mr. Gaultier was working a theme .
2007_03_01_1829627	3	At his best , which he was last night , Mr. Gaultier manages to disguise a nice collection of clothes inside a provocative package .
2007_03_01_1829627	4	Many other designers have worked a Highlands theme of furry plaid riding coats to the hilt , including Alexander McQueen , Marc Jacobs and Mr. Gaultier himself with his tartan man-skirts -- which somehow failed to ignite a significant fashion change for men , but which made him famous .
2007_03_01_1829627	5	The show was a witty blend of traditional trench coats with built-in satchels strapped through epaulets , mohair skirts in a variation of the Burberry check , and a bomber jacket in sheared argyle mink .
2007_03_01_1829627	6	But the showmanship mattered because it had people talking and paying attention at a time when fashion designers are drowning in their own fashion ennui .
2007_03_01_1829627	7	In a season that has included protestations of boredom from Marc Jacobs in New York and Miuccia Prada in Milan , both responding with clothes that could be described , in rudimentary terms , as a return to the classics , there was not much reason then to quibble with Mr. Gaultier .
2007_03_01_1829627	8	Or with the collection Valentino showed this morning , either .
2007_03_01_1829627	9	That was pure classic camp .
2007_03_01_1829627	10	Valentino 's set looked like something out of the Playboy Club from the 1970s , with a broad marquetry runway leading up to a suggestive floor-to-ceiling '' V , '' and bits of Bette Davis dialogue from '' All About Eve '' piped into the jazzy music as a topless woman writhed on the floor .
2007_03_01_1829627	11	( Truth be told , the woman was a fur protester , and she was being held down by security at the time , but it all had a very sexy retro vibe . )
2007_03_01_1829627	12	Valentino showed his tweed suits with shoulder poufs of spotted fox , red taffeta gowns cinched at the knees with big showy bows , and a coat and skirt ensemble with a sweater , tights and shoes all in the same shade of brown .
2007_03_01_1829627	13	This was one of his better collections , assuming the occasional over-the-top gaffe -- a gumball-shape party dress with Bo Peep satin bows , for instance -- was intended as an ornery gesture .
2007_03_01_1829627	14	One has often gotten the impression that Valentino was trying too hard to reassert his relevance to an audience bored with anything that is not new .
2007_03_01_1829627	15	In channeling Margo Channing 's tantrum of being unwanted , insecure and unloved , he seemed to be having a good laugh at himself . ''
2007_03_01_1829627	16	Infants behave the way I do , you know , '' said the voice of Ms. Davis on the soundtrack . ''
2007_03_01_1829627	17	They 'd get drunk if they knew how . ''
2007_03_01_1829627	18	Such bitingly humorous touches risk coming across as a bit of a queasy surprise , if the designer is covering for a lack of decisive strokes .
2007_03_01_1829627	19	Karl Lagerfeld 's signature collection was strong on coats , in egg shapes , loose sacks and boxy little jackets with upside-down pockets .
2007_03_01_1829627	20	But the dresses of many themes -- sheer tops , sequined belts , asymmetrical gatherings -- had the hurried feel of being made of spare parts churned out of the Lagerfeld factory .
2007_03_01_1829627	21	A silver spiral painted on a long black jersey dress had the unfortunate luck to wind down in such a way as to look like thong underwear trailing around the model 's ankles .
2007_03_01_1829627	22	By alternating similar looks on men and women , the Belgian designer Ann Demeulemeester lent an androgynous wit to her clothes , which were otherwise oh-so-soberly drawn on a cast of chic-looking vampires .
2007_03_01_1829627	23	But this was an unnecessary styling trick .
2007_03_01_1829627	24	Ms. Demeulemeester 's tailoring was superb in three-piece pantsuits outlined with heavy black brocade and sequined waistcoats .

2007_03_01_1829627	28	The serene shapes of ottoman bubble jackets , worn over skirts made of quilted nylon jacket liners , offered no indication that they were made of high-tech performance fabrics , often a blend of polyester with mohair or papery cotton .
2007_03_01_1829627	29	The results were garments that were light to the touch and take up little space .
2007_03_01_1829627	30	Nevertheless , the picture was enthralling FASHION REVIEW
2007_03_01_1829628	0	Thomas C. Burke , a lawyer who was a member of the New York City Board of Education in the 1960s and a trustee of the Altman Foundation , which owned the Fifth Avenue department store B. Altman & Company , died Friday in St. Petersburg , Fla. .
2007_03_01_1829628	1	He was 82 and lived in Watch Hill , R.I. .
2007_03_01_1829628	2	The death was confirmed by his sister Jane O'Connell .
2007_03_01_1829628	3	Mr. Burke , a partner in the Manhattan law firm White & Case , was on the board of education from 1964 to 1968 and a trustee of the Altman Foundation from 1948 to 1998 .
2007_03_01_1829628	4	Thomas Churchill Burke was born in Manhattan on May 2 , 1924 , a son of John and Helen Churchill Burke .
2007_03_01_1829628	5	His father was the president of B. Altman & Company .
2007_03_01_1829628	6	Mr. Burke graduated from Yale in 1945 and got a law degree from Columbia in 1948 .
2007_03_01_1829628	7	He served in the Navy in World War II .
2007_03_01_1829628	8	Besides his sister Jane , Mr. Burke is survived by his wife of 49 years , the former Janet McKay ; another sister , Patricia Debany ; four sons , Thomas Jr. , Michael , James and Peter ; three daughters , Anne Manella , Susan Burke and Janet Connor ; and 14 grandchildren .
2007_03_01_1829629	0	Some 600 charities and foundations have had to file amended tax forms after an Internal Revenue Service study found flaws in the way they reported payments to executives and other employees .
2007_03_01_1829629	1	The I.R.S. has also asked 40 individuals to pay a total of $ 20 million in excise taxes , which is the penalty it imposes when it determines a nonprofit executive has been paid excessively . ''
2007_03_01_1829629	2	We found some problems , '' said Steven T. Miller , the commissioner in charge of the I.R.S. division overseeing tax-exempt and government entities . ''
2007_03_01_1829629	3	Whether they were due to confusion , poor design of the tax forms used by these organizations or something more nefarious , I ca n't tell you . ''
2007_03_01_1829629	4	He said the results of the inquiry , which found flaws in the tax forms of a third of the 1,800 charities and foundations examined , convinced the agency that it needed to do more in the area of compensation at nonprofits .
2007_03_01_1829629	5	The names of the affected organizations and executives were not released .
2007_03_01_1829629	6	Organizations that had to file amended returns either failed to report , or reported incorrectly , perquisites like an executive 's personal use of an organization 's vehicles , travel payments for spouses of executives or other payments and reimbursements , I.R.S. officials said .
2007_03_01_1829629	7	Those whose executives have been asked to pay penalties may have failed to use comparable figures from similar organizations in setting compensation or otherwise failed to justify executive pay levels . ''
2007_03_01_1829629	8	That should n't be read to mean that high compensation was n't paid in the other cases , '' Mr. Miller cautioned . ''
2007_03_01_1829629	9	What it means is that in some cases where we found high compensation -- and we did find it -- the organization has done a good job of using comparables and establishing a procedure to determine it . ''
2007_03_01_1829629	10	The results of the study highlight problems with what many regard as primary tools for assessing nonprofits , the forms they file with the I.R.S. and many state governments , which become public record . ''
2007_03_01_1829629	11	For better or for worse , the tax form is the nonprofit disclosure instrument , '' said Peter Swords , an expert on nonprofit tax reporting and the former head of the New York Nonprofit Coordinating Committee . ''
2007_03_01_1829629	12	It is to nonprofits what the whole S.E.C. regime is to regulated companies , and it is something that ought to be taken very seriously . ''
2007_03_01_1829629	13	Last week , Dan Prives , a blogger and former finance director at World Relief , questioned the way Yale University completes parts of its tax forms .
2007_03_01_1829629	14	Mr. Prives noted on his blog , www.wheremostneeded.org , that the university , which has one of the largest endowments in the nation , does not fully report on its securities transactions , nor does it describe what portion of specific expenses were spent on its programs , administration and fund-raising .
2007_03_01_1829629	15	In contrast , Harvard provides that information in its tax forms . ''
2007_03_01_1829629	16	It surprised me because usually A-list nonprofits like Yale are pretty accurate in their reporting , '' Mr. Prives said in a telephone interview . ''
2007_03_01_1829629	17	It threw a whole monkey wrench into my thinking about what 's being achieved by publishing these forms .
2007_03_01_1829629	18	You can have errors in plain sight and nobody 's picking it up . ''
2007_03_01_1829629	19	Tom Conroy , a Yale spokesman , said the university did not break down specific expenses but did report totals spent on administration and fund-raising . ''
2007_03_01_1829629	20	We believe we follow an option that 's provided for in the instructions that accompany the form , '' Mr. Conroy said .
2007_03_01_1829629	21	Mr. Swords said reporting about compensation , in particular , is fraught with problems . ''
2007_03_01_1829629	22	For obvious , human reasons , people are reluctant to have salaries disclosed , '' he said . ''
2007_03_01_1829629	23	It 's one of the biggest topics of gossip , so there 's been a tendency to underreport it or not to report it at all . ''
2007_03_01_1829629	24	Many charities simply do not adequately understand the reporting requirement , experts say .
2007_03_01_1829629	25	For example , the Buckley School , a private boys school in New York City , stopped listing compensation for its headmaster and other top officials several years ago .
2007_03_01_1829629	26	Its tax forms stated that '' compensation information can be obtained at the school . '' ''
2007_03_01_1829629	27	That 's not adequate , flatly not adequate , '' Mr. Swords said .
2007_03_01_1829629	28	Ogden N. Lewis , a Buckley board member , said the school had just filed an amended 2005 tax form spelling out the compensation of its five highest-paid employees .
2007_03_01_1829629	29	Mr. Lewis said a parent had brought the problem to his attention in a letter . ''
2007_03_01_1829629	30	I checked on the rules when I received that information and learned that we needed to report compensation differently , '' he said . ''
2007_03_01_1829629	31	Once I was aware of it , it seemed clear , very clear . ''
2007_03_01_1829629	32	The I.R.S. study , the largest ever undertaken by the exempt organizations division , began in 2004 amid heightened interest in the issue of nonprofit compensation in the news media and Congress .
2007_03_01_1829629	33	It involved two new units , one devoted to monitoring tax law compliance among nonprofit groups and the other focused on data analysis .
2007_03_01_1829629	34	Among its aims were to identify and stop excessive compensation to nonprofit executives and other insiders through audits and questionnaires and to help nonprofits better understand laws governing reporting and payments to senior employees .
2007_03_01_1829629	35	Mr. Miller said the exercise had spawned further ideas for I.R.S. inquiries .
2007_03_01_1829629	36	The agency has already begun a deeper inquiry into loans made to insiders at charities and foundations , contacting 200 organizations by letter and starting audits at 50 others , he said .
2007_03_01_1829629	37	The potential for recovering additional revenue challenges what current and former I.R.S. officials describe as a long-held belief at the agency that policing nonprofits produces little reward , unlike scrutiny of individuals and for-profit companies .
2007_03_01_1829629	38	Mr. Miller said that with 70 audits still open , he expects the I.R.S. to recoup more than $ 20 million in excise taxes . ''
2007_03_01_1829629	39	There are penalties , too , for incomplete returns , and one of the things we need to look at is are we assessing those penalties in the right circumstances , '' he said .
2007_03_01_1829630	0	Steven B. Stanton has been the city manager of Largo , about 25 miles west of Tampa , for 14 years .
2007_03_01_1829630	1	But he is now facing dismissal after his plans to have sex-change surgery became public .
2007_03_01_1829630	2	The City Commission placed Mr. Stanton , 48 , on paid leave on Tuesday night after voting 5 to 2 to begin the process of firing him .
2007_03_01_1829630	3	Mr. Stanton had recently confirmed that he is a transsexual and announced his sex-change plans after an area newspaper reported that he was receiving hormone therapy in preparation for the operation .
2007_03_01_1829630	4	About 500 Largo residents attended the commission meeting Tuesday , and commissioners have received hundreds of e-mail messages , most supporting the resolution to fire Mr. Stanton , which was introduced by Commissioner Mary G. Black . ''
2007_03_01_1829630	5	I do not feel he has the integrity , nor the trust , nor the respect , nor the confidence to continue as the city manager , '' The Associated Press quoted Ms. Black as saying .
2007_03_01_1829630	6	Mayor Pat Gerard , who voted against removing Mr. Stanton , said he had been '' a pretty fierce defender of the city . '' ''
2007_03_01_1829630	7	He is a great city manager and would have continued to be a great city manager , and we did n't give him that opportunity , '' Ms. Gerard said .
2007_03_01_1829630	8	Andy Guyette , a commissioner who voted to fire Mr. Stanton , said he backed him until learning that he had shared his secret with some city officials , who offered support .
2007_03_01_1829630	9	Mr. Guyette said he feared Mr. Stanton , who supervises about 1,200 employees , could not lead the city without favoring his supporters . ''
2007_03_01_1829630	10	I 'd second-guess every decision he made , '' Mr. Guyette said . ''
2007_03_01_1829630	11	There was a lot of hiring and promoting and firing and every one of them could have been influenced by this whole scenario . ''
2007_03_01_1829630	12	Mr. Stanton could not be reached for comment .
2007_03_01_1829630	13	Under the city charter , he has the right to request a public hearing to appeal the decision before commissioners meet to confirm their vote .
2007_03_01_1829630	14	If the removal becomes final , Mr. Stanton will receive a severance package including a year 's salary , $ 140,000 .
2007_03_01_1829631	0	The district attorney who brought sexual assault charges against three Duke lacrosse players did not intentionally violate ethics rules , his lawyers said yesterday in their first response to charges by the state bar .
2007_03_01_1829631	1	The bar has accused the prosecutor , Michael B. Nifong , of withholding potentially exculpatory DNA evidence from the defense and making false and inflammatory public statements that prejudiced the rights of the accused .
2007_03_01_1829631	2	In a 49-page filing , the lawyers said Mr. Nifong had provided complete DNA results to defense lawyers well before a trial was scheduled .
2007_03_01_1829631	3	Mr. Nifong 's lawyers said he was not required to highlight in an earlier summary report the fact that traces of unidentified male DNA were found on the accuser and that there was none from any lacrosse player .
2007_03_01_1829631	4	Mr. Nifong handed the case to the state attorney general after the ethics charges were filed on Dec. 28 .
2007_03_01_1829631	5	The attorney general 's office is reviewing documents and interviewing witnesses as it decides about proceeding with charges of sexual assault .
2007_03_01_1829631	6	In their filing , Mr. Nifong 's lawyers moved for dismissal of the most serious charges , withholding DNA evidence .
2007_03_01_1829631	7	They said they would prevail in front of a three-member panel this year on the other charges .
2007_03_01_1829631	8	If Mr. Nifong is found to have violated ethics rules , the lawyers added , it '' was not intentional , nor the result of a dishonest or selfish motive . ''
2007_03_01_1829631	9	In a phone interview , one lawyer , Dudley A. Witt , said people had rushed to judgment about Mr. Nifong 's handling of the case . ''
2007_03_01_1829631	10	I think it will do everybody good to sit back and allow the process to work , '' Mr. Witt said .
2007_03_01_1829631	11	The lawyers said the public comments on the case over eight days early in the investigation were intended to assure the community that a stripper 's complaint was being taken seriously and to try to develop new information .
2007_03_01_1829631	12	Mr. Nifong had said he was certain that a rape had occurred and that lacrosse players were '' hooligans '' hiding behind a '' wall of silence . ''
2007_03_01_1829631	13	His lawyers said no one 's rights were violated because no individual suspect was identified in the early days .
2007_03_01_1829631	14	The filing had no new facts on the underlying case , which two experienced prosecutors in the special prosecutions division are re-investigating .
2007_03_01_1829631	15	They have been poring over documents and interviewing the complainant , other witnesses , defense lawyers and Mr. Nifong .
2007_03_01_1829631	16	A woman from Durham , N.C. , who had been hired to strip at a party for the lacrosse team on March 13 said three men raped her .
2007_03_01_1829631	17	The case caused a frenzy over issues of race , class and sex .
2007_03_01_1829631	18	The woman is black and poor .
2007_03_01_1829631	19	The lacrosse players are white and more well-to-do .
2007_03_01_1829631	20	Mr. Nifong '' did not fully understand the extent of the national media interest '' and the effects of his statements on the case , his lawyers wrote .
2007_03_01_1829631	21	Mr. Nifong dropped the rape charges on Dec. 22 after the woman said she was not certain whether a penis had penetrated her .
2007_03_01_1829631	22	Mr. Nifong retained charges of sexual offense and kidnapping , which carry equally serious penalties .
2007_03_01_1829631	23	The next hearing in the criminal case is scheduled for May 7 .
2007_03_01_1829631	24	The ethics case is scheduled for June .
2007_03_01_1829631	25	Mr. Witt said he would ask for a delay because of a scheduling conflict .
2007_03_01_1829631	26	The ethics charges carry penalties like reprimand and disbarment .
2007_03_01_1829633	0	A federal judge found Jose Padilla competent to stand trial on terrorism conspiracy charges Wednesday , granting a significant victory to the government in the high-profile criminal case of a United States citizen who was initially designated an '' enemy combatant '' and held without charges .
2007_03_01_1829633	1	After three and a half days of an intensely argued hearing , Judge Marcia G. Cooke of Federal District Court rejected the defense lawyers ' request that Mr. Padilla be sent to a hospital for psychiatric treatment so that he could be '' healed '' from what they said was post-traumatic stress disorder caused during his three years and eight months in military detention . ''
2007_03_01_1829633	2	This defendant clearly has the capacity to assist his attorneys , '' Judge Cooke said , adding that Mr. Padilla 's case was '' unique '' and that '' he understands that . ''
2007_03_01_1829633	3	Judge Cooke , who allowed limited testimony from brig officials during the competency hearing , said that her ruling should not be construed as a finding on Mr. Padilla 's claims of mistreatment during his detention and interrogations at a military brig in South Carolina . ''
2007_03_01_1829633	4	Those claims are for another day , '' she said , referring to another pending motion by Mr. Padilla that the charges against him be dismissed because of '' outrageous government conduct . ''
2007_03_01_1829633	5	The threshold for legal competency is low , requiring a criminal defendant to have the capacity , on a basic level , both to understand the proceedings and to communicate with his lawyers .
2007_03_01_1829633	6	Most incompetency claims in federal court are denied , said Christopher Slobogin , an expert in law and psychiatry at the University of Florida , and most defendants found incompetent are clearly psychotic .
2007_03_01_1829633	7	Mr. Padilla is not .
2007_03_01_1829633	8	Throughout the competency hearing , Mr. Padilla , wearing a tan prison jumpsuit and wire-rimmed glasses , appeared alert .
2007_03_01_1829633	9	When the brig officials testified Monday , he dropped his head and '' hunkered down , '' as one of his lawyers described it , but at all others times he sat erectly and calmly , without displaying the tics and grimaces that his lawyers described as manifestations of his disorder .
2007_03_01_1829633	10	Judge Cooke remarked on Mr. Padilla 's attentiveness in court and noted that '' everyone discussed that Mr. Padilla is polite almost to a fault . ''
2007_03_01_1829633	11	His comportment , Mr. Padilla 's lawyers argued , is not the problem .
2007_03_01_1829633	12	Rather , they said , the trauma of his interrogations -- at least 87 videotaped interrogations have been turned over to them , indicating a substantial amount of questioning -- had rendered him incapable to assist in his own defense .
2007_03_01_1829633	13	He refuses , they said , to discuss the facts of his cases , insisting that he has already told them everything when , they said , he has told them nothing .
2007_03_01_1829633	14	Before she ruled this afternoon , Judge Cooke asked the government about that . ''
2007_03_01_1829633	15	If the defendant refuses to discuss vast sections of his case , is that in and of itself not inability to assist counsel ? ''
2007_03_01_1829633	16	But prosecutors maintained that Mr. Padilla was capable of consulting with his lawyers and that any failure to do so was willful .
2007_03_01_1829633	17	John C. Shipley , an assistant United States attorney , said that Mr. Padilla was a principal source of information for his lawyers ' accusations of mistreatment in military detention . ''
2007_03_01_1829633	18	It does n't make sense that if the root of the defendant 's hesitancy to talk '' was his treatment in the brig , Mr. Shipley said , that the brig would be the only thing he discussed with his lawyers .
2007_03_01_1829633	19	Mr. Padilla 's lawyers said that they and their mental health experts only slowly elicited information about his time in military detention , largely by asking him yes and no questions .
2007_03_01_1829633	20	The defense lawyers also said that Mr. Padilla opposed their efforts to have him found incompetent to stand trial , which they said was further evidence of his irrationality .
2007_03_01_1829633	21	He would rather spend his life in prison than spend a few months in a psychiatric hospital , they said .
2007_03_01_1829633	22	With a trial scheduled for mid-April , Mr. Padilla and two other defendants are accused of participating in a '' North American support cell '' that provided money , goods and recruits abroad to assist '' global jihad . ''
2007_03_01_1829634	0	The question for the Supreme Court on Wednesday was a jurisdictional one : whether taxpayers who object to the way the White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives spends its money can get into federal court to make their case .
2007_03_01_1829634	1	Whether the office or its programs actually run afoul of the Constitution was not before the justices .
2007_03_01_1829634	2	But any notion that this jurisdictional question was the sort of arcane , technical issue that only a law professor could love was quickly dispelled by the intensity of the argument , one of the liveliest of the term .
2007_03_01_1829634	3	The fast-paced hour ended with the clear impression that the Roberts court will soon put its own stamp on the law of taxpayer standing , with potentially significant implications for the relationship between government and religion .
2007_03_01_1829634	4	The real question by the end of the argument was whether a majority would be content simply to scale back a Warren court precedent that allows taxpayers to challenge the use of public money for religious purposes or whether the court would disavow the precedent altogether and keep such suits out of federal court .
2007_03_01_1829634	5	Solicitor General Paul D. Clement revealed his hand slowly , bringing his argument to a pinpoint landing at the precise close of a three-minute rebuttal .
2007_03_01_1829634	6	If the justices could not see their way to applying the precedent narrowly , Mr. Clement said , the court should simply overrule it . ''
2007_03_01_1829634	7	If something has to go in this area , '' he said , '' I think it 's an easy choice . ''
2007_03_01_1829634	8	Under either option the administration advocated , the court would reject a suit that the federal appeals court in Chicago reinstated last year , a challenge to conferences that Bush administration officials have held to advise religious groups on how to apply for federal grants as part of the effort to bolster the role of such groups in social service programs .
2007_03_01_1829634	9	The plaintiff is the Freedom From Religion Foundation Inc. of Madison , Wis. , which advocates strict separation of church and state .
2007_03_01_1829634	10	In a complaint filed initially in 2004 , the organization argued that officials who convened and addressed the conferences used congressionally appropriated money in a way that '' violated the fundamental principle of the separation of church and state . ''
2007_03_01_1829634	11	Under the ordinary doctrine of '' standing , '' which defines who may bring a suit , people who object to a government policy but who can not claim a concrete injury from that policy have no right to sue .
2007_03_01_1829634	12	But in a 1968 decision , the court carved out an exception for religion cases .
2007_03_01_1829634	13	The case , Flast v. Cohen , gave taxpayers standing to challenge federal laws that authorized expenditures for purposes alleged to violate the First Amendment prohibition against the '' establishment '' of religion .
2007_03_01_1829634	14	The administration position in the case argued on Wednesday , Hein v. Freedom From Religion Foundation Inc. , No. 06-157 , is that the Flast decision should be understood to include two limitations .
2007_03_01_1829634	15	First , Mr. Clement said , taxpayers should be limited to challenging Congressional statutes , not executive branch programs like that in this suit .
2007_03_01_1829634	16	Second , the solicitor general argued , taxpayers should be able to challenge only spending outside the government , not internal spending like that cited by the Freedom From Religion Foundation .
2007_03_01_1829634	17	Did that mean , Justice Antonin Scalia asked Mr. Clement , taxpayers could challenge a statute that gave money to outside groups to build churches , but not one that directed the government to build its own church ?
2007_03_01_1829634	18	It was a '' horrible hypothetical , '' Mr. Clement replied , but Justice Scalia had understood him correctly : taxpayers should not have standing to challenge '' an internal government church . ''
2007_03_01_1829634	19	Andrew J. Pincus , representing the foundation , told the court there was '' no basis for drawing the arbitrary lines that the government suggests . ''
2007_03_01_1829634	20	The Flast decision did not include such limitations , he said .
2007_03_01_1829634	21	Mr. Clement was unruffled as the justices tossed various hypothetical questions his way .
2007_03_01_1829634	22	Could a taxpayer challenge a law that commemorated the Pilgrims '' by building a government church at Plymouth Rock where we will have the regular worship in the Puritan religion ? ''
2007_03_01_1829634	23	Justice Stephen G. Breyer asked . ''
2007_03_01_1829634	24	I would say no , '' Mr. Clement said .
2007_03_01_1829634	25	Justice Breyer persisted , asking about a law requiring the government to build churches '' all over America '' dedicated to one particular sect . ''
2007_03_01_1829634	26	Nobody could challenge it ? ''
2007_03_01_1829634	27	There would not be taxpayer standing , '' Mr. Clement replied .
2007_03_01_1829634	28	Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. observed that members of other denominations would not need taxpayer standing and that as victims of government discrimination , they could sue under ordinary principles of standing .
2007_03_01_1829634	29	This was one of the times the chief justice intervened to make the point that in practical application the government 's position was perhaps not as extreme as it sounded .
2007_03_01_1829634	30	His interventions in the other side 's argument seemed to have the opposite goal , rejecting Mr. Pincus 's effort to depict his client 's position as modest .
2007_03_01_1829634	31	When Mr. Pincus said taxpayers should not be permitted to challenge merely '' incidental '' spending , the chief justice said that was no real limitation because it would ensnare the courts in deciding '' whether the activity you 're challenging is incidental or not . ''
2007_03_01_1829634	32	Mr. Pincus denied that this initial inquiry would make much work for the courts .
2007_03_01_1829634	33	For example , he began , '' if someone 's claim is that people in the White House have five meetings in the course of a year that they 're upset about -- -- '' Chief Justice Roberts cut him off , saying , '' Well , then , five meetings is n't enough .
2007_03_01_1829634	34	How many ? '' ''
2007_03_01_1829634	35	What about 10 ? ''
2007_03_01_1829634	36	Justice Scalia offered . ''
2007_03_01_1829634	37	the chief justice asked . ''
2007_03_01_1829634	38	We 'll litigate it , '' Justice Scalia said . ''
2007_03_01_1829634	39	We 'll figure out a number eventually , I 'm sure . ''
2007_03_01_1829634	40	For Mr. Clement , the most helpful hand was that of Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. .
2007_03_01_1829634	41	As the solicitor general batted back tricky hypothetical questions , Justice Alito asked him whether the lines he was drawing '' make a lot of sense in an abstract sense '' or were '' the best that can be done '' under existing precedents . ''
2007_03_01_1829634	42	The latter , Justice Alito , '' Mr. Clement said , evoking laughter . ''
2007_03_01_1829634	43	I appreciate the question . ''
2007_03_01_1829635	0	David C. Iglesias , who was dismissed as the United States attorney in New Mexico , has said he believes that he was ousted because he resisted pressure before the 2006 elections to bring corruption charges against a Democrat in his state , a Democratic senator said on Wednesday .
2007_03_01_1829635	1	Mr. Iglesias has told Congressional aides that two federal lawmakers had separately called him in mid-October asking about the status of an inquiry involving a statehouse construction contract and a former Democratic state lawmaker , Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York said in a statement Wednesday on the Senate floor .
2007_03_01_1829635	2	Mr. Schumer did not identify the lawmakers who made the calls either by name or party affiliation , but he suggested that they wanted Mr. Iglesias to move quickly with indictments before the November elections to help Republicans .
2007_03_01_1829635	3	Mr. Iglesias is one of eight United States attorneys known to have been dismissed in recent months by the Justice Department .
2007_03_01_1829635	4	Each had been appointed by President Bush during his first term , but Democrats have criticized the removals as politically motivated .
2007_03_01_1829635	5	Senator Dianne Feinstein , Democrat of California , said in a floor statement that the firings represented an effort '' to bring political operatives into these offices . ''
2007_03_01_1829635	6	Mr. Iglesias 's account of the calls was first reported on Wednesday by the McClatchy Newspapers , which said the prosecutor would not identify the lawmakers because he feared retaliation .
2007_03_01_1829635	7	But in that report , he described the contacts as '' appalling . ''
2007_03_01_1829635	8	Justice Department officials said politics was not a factor in Mr. Iglesias 's ouster . ''
2007_03_01_1829635	9	The suggestion that David Iglesias was asked to resign because he failed to bring an indictment over a courthouse construction contract is flatly false , '' said Brian Roehrkasse , a Justice Department spokesman .
2007_03_01_1829635	10	Mr. Roehrkasse added , '' This administration has never removed a United States attorney in an effort to retaliate against them or inappropriately interfere with a public integrity investigation . ''
2007_03_01_1829635	11	The former United States attorneys were not given explanations for their dismissals at the time of their removals , but senior Justice Department officials have said that most were asked to step aside because of job performance problems -- an accusation that has angered several and that some have publicly denied .
2007_03_01_1829635	12	Mr. Iglesias could not be reached on Wednesday .
2007_03_01_1829635	13	But The Associated Press reported that at a news conference in Albuquerque on Wednesday , his last day in office , Mr. Iglesias said his dismissal was unrelated to his office 's work . ''
2007_03_01_1829635	14	I know it 's not performance-related , '' Mr. Iglesias told The Associated Press . ''
2007_03_01_1829635	15	I know it 's not misconduct .
2007_03_01_1829635	16	What does that leave ?
2007_03_01_1829635	17	Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee said they would invite Mr. Iglesias and some of the other ousted prosecutors to appear before the panel , even though some have said privately that they would not testify unless they were subpoenaed .
2007_03_01_1829635	18	Democratic lawmakers have questioned the Justice Department 's motives because such dismissals are unusual and because six of the eight prosecutors , including Mr. Iglesias , had received favorable job evaluations .
2007_03_01_1829635	19	A Justice Department review of Mr. Iglesias 's job performance , dated November 2005 , concluded that he was '' respected by the judiciary , agencies and staff '' and had a strategic plan that '' complied with the department 's priorities . ''
2007_03_01_1829635	20	Other ousted prosecutors had similarly positive evaluations .
2007_03_01_1829635	21	A March 2006 performance review of John McKay , who was removed from the United States attorney 's office in Seattle , found him to be '' an effective , well regarded and capable leader . ''
2007_03_01_1829635	22	A December 2003 review of Paul K. Charlton , who was ousted as the top federal prosecutor in Arizona , concluded that he was '' well respected '' by his staff , American Indian nations , local law enforcement and the judiciary '' regarding his integrity , professionalism and competence . ''
2007_03_01_1829636	0	The straw poll at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference beginning here Thursday has never played a pivotal role in a Republican presidential primary .
2007_03_01_1829636	1	But the Mitt Romney campaign nonetheless is paying for three vans , scores of registration fees and at least a half-dozen hotel rooms to pack collegiate supporters into the event .
2007_03_01_1829636	2	The turnout drive -- 10 months before the first primary -- is the latest sign of both the early start and bulging budgets of the 2008 presidential campaign .
2007_03_01_1829636	3	But the conference may be especially important to Mr. Romney , who is trying to reassure social conservatives that his views have shifted to the right from some of the liberal positions he took as the governor of Massachusetts .
2007_03_01_1829636	4	Kevin Madden , a spokesman for the Romney campaign , said the conference volunteers were part of a long-term effort to build grass-roots support . ''
2007_03_01_1829636	5	These volunteers are the folks who are going to be on the front lines of our campaign across the country , '' Mr. Madden said . ''
2007_03_01_1829636	6	The investment that we are making here is going to offer a greater result as this campaign continues to grow . ''
2007_03_01_1829636	7	Mr. Madden said the Romney campaign planned to have at least 225 student volunteers at the event , with 90 percent of them living close enough to eliminate the need for housing or transportation .
2007_03_01_1829636	8	Last year the event drew more than 4,000 activists .
2007_03_01_1829636	9	But only about 600 people , mostly students , participated in the poll .
2007_03_01_1829636	10	Every Republican presidential candidate so far except Senator John McCain will speak at the event .
2007_03_01_1829636	11	All the campaigns encourage their supporters to turn out for the conference and other straw polls .
2007_03_01_1829636	12	But organizers of the conservative political action conference said reports from students indicated that Mr. Romney 's was the only campaign providing transportation or hotel rooms .
2007_03_01_1829636	13	The campaign has provided small buses or vans for students from Michigan and Boston , two strongholds of support for Mr. Romney .
2007_03_01_1829636	14	Matthew C. Hall , youth chairman of the Michigan Republican Party , said that he had tried to get other campaigns to provide buses , too , but that none were willing . ''
2007_03_01_1829636	15	I would expect Romney will do pretty well in the straw poll because his campaign is the one we are seeing investing so much money and energy into it , '' Mr. Hall , who said he was not affiliated with any primary campaign , wrote in an e-mail message . ''
2007_03_01_1829636	16	The response we 've seen from students in Michigan is that regardless of who they are supporting for president , they are more than willing to take a free trip to the conference if all they have to do in return is wear a shirt and vote for him in a straw poll . ''
2007_03_01_1829636	17	Stephen Dewey , a student at Harvard , said he had recruited seven students who support Mr. Romney to travel to the conference in a van provided by the campaign . ''
2007_03_01_1829636	18	For those of you who have never been , it is a great opportunity ( especially when it is free ) , '' said an e-mail message circulated by Mr. Dewey .
2007_03_01_1829636	19	The conservative conference poll is not the only straw poll attracting attention this week .
2007_03_01_1829636	20	About a half-dozen Republican candidates have visited Spartanburg , S.C. , recently in anticipation of its Republican straw poll on Thursday .
2007_03_01_1829636	21	Rick Beltram , the county party chairman , said former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas was the only one not to appear .
2007_03_01_1829636	22	The South Carolina poll is expected to attract about 1,500 registered voters .
2007_03_01_1829636	23	Mr. Beltram said that several candidates had sent direct mail and organized phone banks , and that Mr. Romney 's campaign had bought television commercials in the state since Monday .
2007_03_01_1829636	24	David Keene , chairman of the American Conservative Union and the organizer of the Washington conference , said he was surprised and flattered that Mr. Romney would put so much effort into bringing in supporters , especially 10 months before the start of the election calendar . ''
2007_03_01_1829636	25	It makes us look sort of important , does n't it ? ''
2007_03_01_1829636	26	Mr. Romney 's focus on the conference fits with a strategy laid out in a 77-page planning document for his campaign that was reported Tuesday by The Boston Globe .
2007_03_01_1829636	27	According to The Globe , the plan recommended presenting '' brand Romney '' as the '' anti-Kerry , '' a contrast to the liberalism of Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts , the Democratic presidential nominee in 2004 , and urged Mr. Romney to establish his conservative credentials early to avoid the accusations of flip-flopping that dogged Mr. Kerry .
2007_03_01_1829636	28	Conservatives suspect Mr. Romney of political opportunism because he has changed his past liberal positions on abortion rights , stem cell research , gay rights and gun control .
2007_03_01_1829636	29	Supporters of Mr. Romney also paid for hotel rooms for some activists who attended last spring 's Southern Republican Leadership Conference , site of another straw poll .
2007_03_01_1829636	30	Organizers of the annual conservative conference said that another concerted effort to get student supporters to the event was organized in early 2000 by Gary Bauer , a Christian conservative candidate for the Republican nomination .
2007_03_01_1829636	31	Mr. Bauer said in an interview that he had organized the effort to help prove he was a viable candidate and considered his strong showing a success .
2007_03_01_1829636	32	But he dropped out early in the primaries nonetheless .
2007_03_01_1829637	0	A major conservative group agreed to pay a $ 750,000 penalty as part of a settlement with the Federal Election Commission , which found that the group violated campaign finance laws by spending more than $ 30 million on advertisements and mailings supporting President Bush 's re-election .
2007_03_01_1829637	1	The fine was the third largest in the agency 's 32-year-history .
2007_03_01_1829637	2	The settlement reflects a crackdown in the last several months on the political activities of so-called 527 groups -- named after a section of the tax law -- that surfaced in the 2004 election as a powerful force , raising and spending hundreds of millions of dollars in unregulated contributions through a loophole in the law . ''
2007_03_01_1829637	3	I think that the thing that is clear in all of these cases is that the agency is very serious about regulating both the solicitations and the advertisements that these groups do , to try to discern whether their purpose is to influence federal elections , '' said Robert Lenhard , chairman of the F.E.C. .
2007_03_01_1829637	4	The agency found that the group , the Progress for America Voter Fund , operated as a political action committee , soliciting money and financing advertisements .
2007_03_01_1829637	5	It spent $ 26.4 million alone on advertising in battleground states in 2004 for the purpose of retaining Mr. Bush as president .
2007_03_01_1829637	6	Its actions violated campaign laws because it was not registered as a political action committee that would be subject to strict limits on donations .
2007_03_01_1829637	7	The agency said it circumvented a ban on corporate money and accepted contributions that well exceeded the caps on individual donations .
2007_03_01_1829637	8	The group 's most memorable advertisements included '' Ashley 's Story , '' featuring Mr. Bush hugging a girl whose mother died in the World Trade Center attacks and who said the president kept her safe .
2007_03_01_1829637	9	That cost $ 16.5 million and was broadcast in 11 states and on national cable , the agency said .
2007_03_01_1829637	10	The group admitted no wrongdoing under the agreement , but promised to register as a political action committee if it decided to keep operating the same way .
2007_03_01_1829637	11	It also agreed to file disclosure reports listing donors and other information from May 2004 through January of this year .
2007_03_01_1829637	12	It reported raising $ 44.9 million in 2004 , with nearly three-fourths from 13 donors , the agency said .
2007_03_01_1829637	13	Critics and campaign finance reform groups contended in the 2004 election cycle that the 527 groups acted as '' shadow parties . ''
2007_03_01_1829637	14	Since then , many have regrouped or closed shop .
2007_03_01_1829637	15	Mr. Lenhard warned Wednesday that groups registered under other sections of the tax code -- nonprofits known as 501 ( c ) 4s or 501 ( c ) 3s , for example -- would also be subject to scrutiny . ''
2007_03_01_1829637	16	These rules are conduct-based , '' he said . ''
2007_03_01_1829637	17	If these organizations engage in these kinds of activities , they become PACs regardless of their tax status . ''
2007_03_01_1829637	18	For those who continue , Mr. Lenhard said , '' I think that they have to comply , and they have to understand if they do n't there 's a significant financial risk associated with it . ''
2007_03_01_1829637	19	Benjamin L. Ginsburg , a prominent Republican lawyer representing the group in this case , cited the financial stakes as a reason for the agreement . ''
2007_03_01_1829637	20	Despite Congressional pressure to impose some set of rules or provide guidance for so-called 527 groups , the F.E.C. still refuses to do so , '' Mr. Ginsburg said . ''
2007_03_01_1829637	21	Given the ambiguous nature of this situation and the cost of litigating this dispute , '' he added , the group '' decided it is a more prudent use of its resources and energy to conclude this proceeding . ''
2007_03_01_1829637	22	Mr. Ginsburg also represented the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth , another 527 group , which attacked Senator John Kerry ; it reached a settlement with the F.E.C. in December .
2007_03_01_1829637	23	The agency is still engaged in a court battle over its decision to regulate such groups on a case-by-case basis rather than through a uniform rule .
2007_03_01_1829637	24	Fred Wertheimer , head of Democracy 21 , a group involved in this 527 complaint , said the agency had not acted on complaints against two other groups that were Democratic powerhouses in 2004 , America Coming Together and the Media Fund .
2007_03_01_1829637	25	Mr. Wertheimer praised the size of the penalty Wednesday , but said , '' We do n't want to see a system where people keep making illegal expenditures in campaigns and then two or three years later end up paying a fine that may be large in gross terms but is proportionally very small compared to the amount of illegal funds they spent in the election . ''
2007_03_01_1829637	26	The Progress for America Voter Fund was created as an offshoot of Progress for America in late May 2004 .
2007_03_01_1829637	27	It solicited money in part by promoting its efforts to counter the Democrats ' distinct advantage in using mega-527 groups through affluent donors like George Soros .
2007_03_01_1829638	0	Two senior Bush administration officials vowed on Wednesday to work with Congress to ensure passage of immigration legislation this year but publicly distanced themselves from proposals that would place most illegal immigrants on a path to citizenship .
2007_03_01_1829638	1	Commerce Secretary Carlos M. Gutierrez and Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff suggested that offering temporary legal status , instead of citizenship , to illegal immigrants would be enough to persuade them to emerge from the shadows and register with the government , which has been a key national security goal .
2007_03_01_1829638	2	The officials were testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee as lawmakers worked out the final details of a broad immigration bill that could be introduced in the Senate as early as next week .
2007_03_01_1829638	3	Last year , the Senate passed bipartisan immigration legislation that would have provided citizenship to most illegal immigrants who paid fines and back taxes and learned English .
2007_03_01_1829638	4	That legislation stalled in the face of fierce opposition from House Republicans , but this year 's bill is expected to include a similar proposal .
2007_03_01_1829638	5	Democrats and Republicans believe that prospects for passage are far better in this Democratic-controlled Congress , but the contentious debate over citizenship underscores the difficulties ahead .
2007_03_01_1829638	6	The citizenship measure has been derided by conservatives as amnesty and hailed by some Democrats , Republicans and immigrant advocates as a provision that will encourage millions of illegal immigrants to come forward .
2007_03_01_1829638	7	In August , President Bush suggested that he supported such proposals , saying they sounded like '' a reasonable way to treat people with respect . ''
2007_03_01_1829638	8	But on Wednesday , Mr. Gutierrez and Mr. Chertoff declined to endorse the measure .
2007_03_01_1829638	9	Mr. Gutierrez said many illegal immigrants might prefer working here for several years and returning home . ''
2007_03_01_1829638	10	That is something we need to discuss , we need to think through , '' Mr. Gutierrez said . ''
2007_03_01_1829638	11	There is a path today to citizenship , so it is not as if we need to create a new path to citizenship . '' ''
2007_03_01_1829638	12	What people want first and foremost is legal status , '' he said . ''
2007_03_01_1829638	13	I 'm not sure everybody wants to be a U.S. citizen .
2007_03_01_1829638	14	Many just want to be able to work .
2007_03_01_1829638	15	And if they can work legally , one day they would like to go back home . ''
2007_03_01_1829638	16	Mr. Chertoff noted that only about a third of the illegal immigrants granted legal status as a result of legislation passed in 1986 actually ended up applying for citizenship . ''
2007_03_01_1829638	17	A significant majority did not become citizens , '' he said .
2007_03_01_1829638	18	It was unclear whether the officials were simply trying to ease conservative concerns about the citizenship question or whether Mr. Bush had actually shifted his position .
2007_03_01_1829638	19	Scott Stanzel , a White House spokesman , said Mr. Bush still supported a path to citizenship that would include payments of fines back taxes and a requirement to learn English , among other things .
2007_03_01_1829638	20	But it seemed unlikely that the two cabinet secretaries would make such remarks without first consulting the White House .
2007_03_01_1829638	21	But advocates for immigrants warned that legislation without a path to citizenship would be unacceptable to many Democrats and some Republicans .
2007_03_01_1829638	22	They also objected to another proposal suggested by Mr. Chertoff , which would limit judicial review of decisions made by immigration officials determining eligibility for the legalization program . ''
2007_03_01_1829638	23	Without the inclusion of a path to citizenship in a legalization program , you are essentially creating a permanent underclass in our country , '' said Bishop Gerald Barnes of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops Committee on Migration .
2007_03_01_1829638	24	Lawmakers also highlighted other concerns .
2007_03_01_1829638	25	Senator Arlen Specter , the Pennsylvania Republican who was a key architect of last year 's bill , complained that he and other Republicans were being shut out of negotiations over the new legislation .
2007_03_01_1829638	26	Meanwhile , Senator Dianne Feinstein , a California Democrat who supported the bill last year , said she now believed it was overly broad and susceptible to fraud .
2007_03_01_1829638	27	Senator Patrick J. Leahy , the Vermont Democrat who is chairman of the Judiciary Committee , said Mr. Bush would have to ensure that lawmakers came together . ''
2007_03_01_1829638	28	It 's not going to be an easy process , '' Mr. Leahy said .
2007_03_01_1829639	0	South Africa 's environment minister offered a new plan on Wednesday to control the nation 's booming elephant population that contemplates resuming the much-criticized killing of excess animals , but only after thorough scientific study and as a last resort .
2007_03_01_1829639	1	Without some form of population control , elephants will soon overwhelm the public parks and private game reserves where they can still roam free , the minister , Marthinus van Schalkwyk , warned .
2007_03_01_1829639	2	Mr. van Schalkwyk 's proposal , unveiled at a crowded elephant reserve in the nation 's southeast , appeared to defuse for now a looming confrontation between environmentalists and game managers over ways to manage the nation 's 20,000 elephants , a major tourist attraction and , in some parks , a growing headache .
2007_03_01_1829639	3	National park officials have already considered a mass killing , or culling , of elephants in Kruger National Park , South Africa 's biggest and best-known wildlife reserve .
2007_03_01_1829639	4	They contended that the park , with a population of at least 12,500 elephants , could support only 7,500 .
2007_03_01_1829639	5	Some conservationists have agreed , saying that preserving the park 's biological diversity is more important than saving elephants .
2007_03_01_1829639	6	But some environmentalists and elephant researchers argue that the killings are both unnecessary and inhumane , given elephants ' high intelligence and complex social structure .
2007_03_01_1829639	7	South Africa ordered the killing of more than 14,000 elephants in Kruger until an international outcry helped bring about a moratorium in 1995 .
2007_03_01_1829639	8	Opponents of culling have threatened to start a boycott of South Africa tourism , a huge moneymaker here , were a new culling campaign to be approved .
2007_03_01_1829639	9	While he did not rule out further killings , Mr. van Schalkwyk , who is also minister of tourism , made it clear on Wednesday that the cullings would be both limited and approved only after other options had been exhausted . ''
2007_03_01_1829639	10	The government will never give a blank check to culling , '' he said .
2007_03_01_1829639	11	Instead , the new proposal envisions a range of methods to address the rising number of elephants , including contraception and luring elephants from crowded parks to vacant spaces .
2007_03_01_1829639	12	There are no quick options .
2007_03_01_1829639	13	Contraception is not a simple solution , in part because it subjects female elephants to great stress from more frequent matings with heavy bulls .
2007_03_01_1829639	14	Nor is it easy to relocate elephant herds , although the recent removal of fences between Kruger park and vacant parkland in neighboring Mozambique holds the prospect that elephants will eventually migrate there .
2007_03_01_1829639	15	Mr. van Schalkwyk also allotted about $ 700,000 for scientists to study elephant management techniques and to address some basic questions , including whether the existing population is straining the habitat as much as some say .
2007_03_01_1829639	16	That elephants are destructive is unquestioned .
2007_03_01_1829639	17	African elephants can eat as much as 5 percent of their weight and drink up to 50 gallons of water a day , and herds have been known to reduce forests and bushlands to treeless expanses of weeds , grass and broken stumps .
2007_03_01_1829639	18	The government says that South African herds are growing at a rate of 6 percent a year .
2007_03_01_1829639	19	Left unchecked , officials say , the national elephant population will rise from 20,000 now to more than 34,000 in 2020 , 12 years from now .
2007_03_01_1829639	20	Mr. van Schalkwyk 's proposal must still be subjected to public comment , and it could be months before it or another plan is approved .
2007_03_01_1829639	21	But some critics of South Africa 's elephant management plans gave this one their cautious approval on Wednesday . ''
2007_03_01_1829639	22	The government has committed to the role of science in the context of elephant management in South Africa , and that is critical , '' said Jason Bell-Leask , the southern Africa director of the International Fund for Animal Welfare .
2007_03_01_1829639	23	The fund has run an aggressive campaign against further elephant killings in South Africa .
2007_03_01_1829639	24	Hennie Lotter , an ethicist and philosophy professor at the University of Johannesburg , has called elephant culling '' a just war nobody wants . ''
2007_03_01_1829639	25	Elephants rank close to the top of the hierarchy of animals that merit human respect , he said ; elephants appear to have an elementary language , mourn their dead and raise their young in ways that humans can recognize .
2007_03_01_1829639	26	Mr. Lotter said that the government 's new plan appeared '' to be the responsible thing '' but that its success depended on how it would be carried out .
2007_03_01_1829641	0	Italy 's political crisis ended , for the moment , on Wednesday night after the Senate narrowly passed a vote of confidence in Prime Minister Romano Prodi 's fragile government . ''
2007_03_01_1829641	1	The government is like the Tower of Pisa -- it leans but does n't fall , '' Justice Minister Clemente Mastella said after the 162-to-157 vote .
2007_03_01_1829641	2	But the voting suggested less a strong and viable government aimed at electoral reform than one fated to face a new election before its five-year term is over .
2007_03_01_1829641	3	In speeches before the vote , even some of Mr. Prodi 's supporters said that while they would vote for renewing the government , they would not back him on several contentious issues where every vote counts .
2007_03_01_1829641	4	Indeed , another crisis may not be far off : a vote on Italy 's peacekeeping mission in Afghanistan -- one of the same issues that temporarily knocked down Mr. Prodi 's government a week ago -- is set for the next two weeks .
2007_03_01_1829641	5	In his speech in the Senate , Franco Turigliatto , of the Refounded Communists , one of the senators who provoked the crisis a week ago , said he could not support the peacekeeping measure , or others like a planned high-speed train line in the north and pension reform . ''
2007_03_01_1829641	6	This is not the mandate we received , '' Mr. Turigliatto told his colleagues .
2007_03_01_1829641	7	Still , Mr. Prodi said he was relieved that this crisis was over and that he could resume his nine-month-old government -- the 61st in Italy since 1945 . ''
2007_03_01_1829641	8	I am very satisfied , '' he told reporters after the vote . ''
2007_03_01_1829641	9	Now we go to the Chamber . ''
2007_03_01_1829641	10	He was referring to the lower house of Parliament , the Chamber of Deputies , where the government faces a second vote of confidence on Friday .
2007_03_01_1829641	11	The government enjoys a larger majority in that house , and the vote is expected to favor Mr. Prodi 's government .
2007_03_01_1829641	12	The crisis began a week ago after Mr. Turigliatto and another far-left senator abstained from a key vote on Mr. Prodi 's foreign policy , in disagreements over Afghanistan and the government 's support of the expansion of an American military base in Vicenza , in Italy 's north .
2007_03_01_1829641	13	The vote went against Mr. Prodi , and he resigned .
2007_03_01_1829641	14	But on Saturday , the Italian president , Giorgio Napolitano , said there was '' no concrete choice '' and asked Mr. Prodi to try again .
2007_03_01_1829641	15	Even though Mr. Prodi was able to bolster his support among bickering parties , political leaders and analysts began focusing on the larger , structural problems underlying Italy 's politics .
2007_03_01_1829641	16	In recent days , Mr. Prodi himself pledged to tackle the most pressing of them : an electoral law that virtually guarantees a small majority in the Senate .
2007_03_01_1829641	17	In speeches in the Senate on Tuesday , and again just before the vote on Wednesday , he promised immediate changes .
2007_03_01_1829641	18	But that will prove difficult in itself , because , he noted , it will require support from across the nation 's divided political interests . ''
2007_03_01_1829641	19	The new electoral law must guarantee governability and continuity in politics , '' he told senators on Wednesday .
2007_03_01_1829641	20	He added that the solution '' must be shared by everyone . ''
2007_03_01_1829641	21	The present law was passed by the government of Silvio Berlusconi , then the prime minister , before last year 's elections , despite the opposition by Mr. Prodi and his allies .
2007_03_01_1829641	22	Now even Mr. Berlusconi 's allies concede that the law was deeply flawed , and they are urging changes , partly because they are eager to go to the polls to try to regain power .
2007_03_01_1829641	23	Another weakness underscored in the crisis is the vast ideological distance in Mr. Prodi 's nine-party center-left coalition , which ranges from moderate Catholics to Communists .
2007_03_01_1829641	24	Some centrist politicians have been calling for greater cooperation in the middle , and one former ally of Mr. Berlusconi 's , Marco Follini , supported the vote of confidence for Mr. Prodi as the start of a new centrist force . ''
2007_03_01_1829641	25	Here , at one time , there was a bridge between the left and the moderates , '' he said in the Senate . ''
2007_03_01_1829641	26	Now there is a wall .
2007_03_01_1829641	27	It would serve us to build that bridge again . ''
2007_03_01_1829643	0	Music sales spiked slightly two weeks ago after the Grammy Awards , but last week they were back to the familiar doldrums .
2007_03_01_1829643	1	Norah Jones 's '' Not Too Late '' ( Blue Note ) remains at No. 1 , its third week at the top in four weeks of release .
2007_03_01_1829643	2	It moved just under 100,000 copies , a 53 percent drop from the previous week , according to Nielsen SoundScan .
2007_03_01_1829643	3	The next two biggest sellers also had sales slips , but still climbed the Billboard chart .
2007_03_01_1829643	4	Chris Daughtry 's debut , '' Daughtry '' ( RCA ) , sold 84,000 copies , a 17 percent drop , but jumped seven spots to No. 2 , and Fall Out Boy 's '' Infinity on High '' ( Fueled by Ramen/Island ) rose two to No. 3 , despite a 33 percent sales slip to 79,000 . ''
2007_03_01_1829643	5	Kidz Bop 11 '' ( Razor & Tie ) , a compilation of nursery-friendly versions of pop songs , reached No. 4 with 75,000 sales in its first week , and TobyMac , a former member of the Christian rap-rock group dc Talk , opened at No. 1 with his new solo album , '' Portable Sounds '' ( ForeFront ) , selling 51,000 .
2007_03_01_1829644	0	'' Are You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader ? ''
2007_03_01_1829644	1	-- the Fox quiz show from the '' Survivor '' creator Mark Burnett , which derives its questions from elementary school textbooks -- made its debut on Tuesday to the largest audience ever for a series premiere on Fox .
2007_03_01_1829644	2	Featuring the comedian Jeff Foxworthy as host , '' Are You Smarter '' attracted 26.6 million viewers at 9:30 p.m. , according to Nielsen 's estimates .
2007_03_01_1829644	3	It owed some of its ratings success to being scheduled directly after Fox 's '' American Idol , '' which dominated from 8 to 9:30 with 30.4 million viewers .
2007_03_01_1829644	4	CBS ranked second for the night , and NBC was third .
2007_03_01_1829644	5	ABC finished in fourth place , as the ABC News special '' To Iraq and Back : Bob Woodruff Reports '' drew 10.1 million viewers in the 10 p.m. hour , ranking behind CBS 's repeat of '' Criminal Minds '' ( 10.5 million ) and NBC 's '' Law & Order : Special Victims Unit '' ( 11.7 million ) .
2007_03_01_1829644	6	In the cable news race for February , all three channels posted increases from a year ago : among adults ages 25 to 54 in prime time , Fox News saw a 19 percent increase in viewers ( to 408,000 from 342,000 ) , CNN was up 28 percent ( to 244,000 from 190,000 ) and MSNBC improved 20 percent ( to 183,000 from 153,000 ) .
2007_03_01_1829645	0	Nascar spent years developing a racecar for its premier series , the Nextel Cup .
2007_03_01_1829645	1	The so-called Car of Tomorrow was designed to improve safety and competition while limiting costs .
2007_03_01_1829645	2	Nascar and its drivers will soon see .
2007_03_01_1829645	3	The newly dubbed Car of Today made its first visit to Bristol Motor Speedway on Wednesday for a test session before its debut here in a Cup race March 25 .
2007_03_01_1829645	4	Nascar is already thinking about scrapping a three-year phase-in plan and using the car at every track in 2008 .
2007_03_01_1829645	5	The original plan was to use the car in 16 of 36 races this year , in 26 races in 2008 and in all races in 2009 .
2007_03_01_1829645	6	That is a long way from the criticism Nascar heard for years from team owners worried about the necessity and start-up costs of a new car . ''
2007_03_01_1829645	7	The fact of the matter is , the baby 's born , '' John Darby , the director of the Nextel Cup series , said Wednesday . ''
2007_03_01_1829645	8	She 's on the racetrack .
2007_03_01_1829645	9	It 's going around in circles .

2007_03_01_1829645	11	The last I checked , the sun 's still going to set in the west and we 're going to race . ''
2007_03_01_1829645	12	I think a lot of that has just rotated the focus of the teams into making their car the best , which is what they 're here to do , and back off some of the other stuff . ''
2007_03_01_1829645	13	But the veteran driver Jeff Gordon was critical of plans to accelerate the introduction of the car .
2007_03_01_1829645	14	He said that racing teams needed to see how it performed first . ''
2007_03_01_1829645	15	I just think it 's too early to really commit to that , '' he said . ''
2007_03_01_1829645	16	I think there might be a lot of changes that may need to happen for the good . ''
2007_03_01_1829645	17	Teams were busy Wednesday preparing their new cars for the race March 25 .
2007_03_01_1829645	18	A total of 50 drivers tested the half-mile oval at Bristol , seeking to find an edge in a car that is designed to be the same for everyone , despite representing the manufacturers Chevrolet , Ford , Dodge and Toyota .
2007_03_01_1829645	19	Most drivers avoided criticizing the car , although the Formula One veteran and Nascar newcomer Juan Pablo Montoya said that experienced drivers might call it '' horrible . ''
2007_03_01_1829645	20	The defending Nextel Cup champion , Jimmie Johnson , said he was happy about the change .
2007_03_01_1829645	21	He has always struggled at Bristol , but posted some of the fastest times in morning testing . ''
2007_03_01_1829645	22	I went to the top of the board at first , '' he said . ''
2007_03_01_1829645	23	I asked my guys to take a photograph of the computer monitor , document we were at Bristol . ''
2007_03_01_1829645	24	The driver Kasey Kahne called the car '' a different piece . '' ''
2007_03_01_1829645	25	It 's a really rough ride for a while , '' he said . ''
2007_03_01_1829645	26	Everybody is bouncing like crazy out there .
2007_03_01_1829645	27	It 's getting better .
2007_03_01_1829645	28	We 're not even working on going fast .
2007_03_01_1829645	29	We 're just working on getting the car to drive better and settle down on the racetrack . ''
2007_03_01_1829645	30	After Bristol , the Car of Today is scheduled to be used again April 1 at Martinsville Speedway in Virginia .
2007_03_01_1829646	0	There is no proof that a doctor for the Pittsburgh Steelers , who has been questioned by federal agents about his purchase of growth hormone drugs , ever provided or prescribed hormones to any Steelers players , Art Rooney II , the team 's president , said yesterday .
2007_03_01_1829646	1	Richard A. Rydze , who is listed as one of six members of the Steelers ' medical team , said Tuesday that federal agents from New York questioned him in December about his purchase in 2006 of about $ 100,000 worth of human growth hormone from a pharmacy in Florida .
2007_03_01_1829646	2	That pharmacy is now the subject of a multistate investigation into its online sales of steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs .
2007_03_01_1829646	3	Rydze said that investigators had urged him to stop using the pharmacy and that he complied .
2007_03_01_1829646	4	He is not accused of violating any laws .
2007_03_01_1829646	5	Federal agents arrested four people with ties to the Signature Pharmacy in Orlando , Fla. , on Tuesday .
2007_03_01_1829646	6	The pharmacy filled prescriptions written by licensed and unlicensed doctors who never met their purported patients , investigators said .
2007_03_01_1829646	7	Rooney said that he telephoned Rydze on Tuesday after hearing about the investigation and also informed National Football League officials . ''
2007_03_01_1829646	8	There is no evidence that Dr. Rydze prescribed or provided any hormone treatments to any of our players , '' Rooney said in a statement . ''
2007_03_01_1829646	9	Dr. Rydze has assured me that this has never happened and will never happen . ''
2007_03_01_1829646	10	Rooney said the Steelers would '' continue to monitor this situation to make sure that we can continue to feel confident in our medical staff in this area . ''
2007_03_01_1829646	11	Rydze said Tuesday that he never prescribed hormones to Steelers players .
2007_03_01_1829646	12	He did not return phone calls yesterday .
2007_03_01_1829646	13	Rydze has worked as a game day doctor for the Steelers for many years , according to a team spokesman , and is also an internist at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center .
2007_03_01_1829646	14	The medical center said yesterday that it had begun a review into Rydze 's involvement in the federal and state investigation . ''
2007_03_01_1829646	15	We have initiated our internal review , so at this time we have no further factual information or comment , '' said Susan Manko , a medical center spokeswoman .
2007_03_01_1829646	16	Rydze won the silver medal in platform diving at the 1972 Olympics in Munich and is a medical examiner for the Federal Aviation Administration and the medical director of the Pittsburgh office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation .
2007_03_01_1829646	17	He is listed as a member of the American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine , a group that advocates the use of human growth hormone to replace the hormone as it declines with age .
2007_03_01_1829646	18	The group , which has offices in Chicago and Boca Raton , Fla. , tries to advise doctors on how to prescribe the hormone legally .

2007_03_01_1829648	0	You 'll excuse Marvin Miller , please , if he is more concerned right now about his left shoulder than he is about his vote count . ''
2007_03_01_1829648	1	Terry and I were in Florida in mid-December , '' Miller said , referring to his wife . ''
2007_03_01_1829648	2	I was playing tennis , and I came off the court and had pain in my shoulder .
2007_03_01_1829648	3	Two and a half months later , it 's not fun anymore . ''
2007_03_01_1829648	4	Miller has played tennis , his second love after Terry , only once since then -- '' to test it . ''
2007_03_01_1829648	5	Which has been worse , he was asked , not being able to play tennis or falling short again in the voting for the Hall of Fame ? ''
2007_03_01_1829648	6	The tennis is far more important , absolutely , '' Miller said .
2007_03_01_1829648	7	Once upon a time , election to the Hall of Fame might have been on a par with tennis in Miller 's mind , but voters on two veterans committees squandered their opportunity to do the right thing and put Miller where he belongs .
2007_03_01_1829648	8	The old veterans committee , a 15-man body made up of five former players , five management executives and five members of the news media , never seriously considered Miller .
2007_03_01_1829648	9	Committee members did n't think he qualified as a former baseball executive .
2007_03_01_1829648	10	The new veterans committee , made up largely of 61 living Hall of Fame players , has had Miller on its composite ballot ( executives , managers and umpires ) in 2003 and again this year .
2007_03_01_1829648	11	It rejected him both times .
2007_03_01_1829648	12	Miller , though , had the biggest increase in votes from the first election to this one .
2007_03_01_1829648	13	In 2003 he received 35 votes , or 44 percent ; this time he had 51 votes , or 64 percent .
2007_03_01_1829648	14	Had Miller , who has been retired since 1983 , enhanced his impact on baseball during those four years ? ''
2007_03_01_1829648	15	That 's a good question , '' he said Tuesday , laughing . ''
2007_03_01_1829648	16	I 've been searching my mind and I ca n't think of a single thing . ''
2007_03_01_1829648	17	Another question arising from the veterans committee vote : What did Joe Torre do in the past two years to lose nearly 30 percent of his 2005 vote ?
2007_03_01_1829648	18	He plunged to 26 votes ( 32 percent ) from 36 ( 45 percent ) .
2007_03_01_1829648	19	In 2003 , Torre received 29 votes ( 36 percent ) .
2007_03_01_1829648	20	Torre was on the players ' ballot in each instance , but Jeff Idelson , the Hall 's vice president for communications and education , said that '' voters are instructed to consider the totality of a guy 's career . ''
2007_03_01_1829648	21	In other words , even though Torre was listed as a player , voters could consider his accomplishments as a manager .
2007_03_01_1829648	22	Some voters might have considered Torre 's four World Series championships with the Yankees , but it seems the farther Torre gets from that run of managerial success , the more he suffers at the hands of the voters .
2007_03_01_1829648	23	But how to explain the beating Miller has suffered at the hands of the voters ?
2007_03_01_1829648	24	An easy case can be made that Miller is one of the two men who have had the greatest impact on baseball in the last half-century .
2007_03_01_1829648	25	Branch Rickey is the other , and he has been in the Hall of Fame for 40 years .
2007_03_01_1829648	26	The majority of voters played during or after Miller 's tenure as the head of the players union .
2007_03_01_1829648	27	When Miller began his labor leadership of the players , their minimum salary was $ 6,000 , their average salary was $ 19,000 , and free agency did n't exist .
2007_03_01_1829648	28	The creation of free agency in 1976 has sent the minimum to $ 380,000 and the average to $ 2.7 million .
2007_03_01_1829648	29	But Miller 's impact was not only financial .
2007_03_01_1829648	30	Free agency has made players wealthy , but it has also changed the game , turning losers into winners and determining pennant contenders and pennant winners .
2007_03_01_1829648	31	Yet Miller fell 11 votes short of the 75 percent needed for election .
2007_03_01_1829648	32	Of the 61 living Hall of Fame players , 46 played under or after Miller 's leadership .
2007_03_01_1829648	33	At least five others benefited from Miller 's efforts as managers or coaches with higher salaries , better benefits and improved pensions .
2007_03_01_1829648	34	Those members add to 51 , matching the number of votes Miller received .
2007_03_01_1829648	35	But even though voting is confidential , it is virtually certain that Miller received votes from some of the other 30 committee members , meaning an equivalent number of the 51 did not vote for him .
2007_03_01_1829648	36	No one who passed on Miller is known to have stepped forward and explained his vote .
2007_03_01_1829648	37	However , it 's possible that not all players understand the impact Miller has had on their lives .
2007_03_01_1829648	38	He related an instructive tale , although he did n't say that the players he was referring to were Hall of Famers . ''
2007_03_01_1829648	39	I had a conversation with a couple players from the preunion group some months back , '' Miller said . ''
2007_03_01_1829648	40	We were talking about pensions and so on .
2007_03_01_1829648	41	One said the owners have been very generous with them on their pensions .
2007_03_01_1829648	42	Oh my God . ''
2007_03_01_1829648	43	Not surprisingly , Miller is not impressed with the current system of voting . ''
2007_03_01_1829648	44	The system is broken , '' he said .
2007_03_01_1829648	45	The Hall 's board of directors meets March 13 and is expected to make some changes in the electoral system .
2007_03_01_1829648	46	I have no problem with the committee electing no players .
2007_03_01_1829648	47	All 27 players on the ballot went through 15 years on the writers ' ballot and did n't make it .
2007_03_01_1829648	48	They were all seriously considered and rejected .
2007_03_01_1829648	49	It 's hard to argue that anyone fell through the cracks .
2007_03_01_1829648	50	There are people on the composite ballot , however , who deserve to be in the Hall of Fame -- Miller and Walter O'Malley , another major impact guy , like him or not , to name two .
2007_03_01_1829648	51	Miller will turn 90 in six weeks .
2007_03_01_1829648	52	Unless the system is changed , he will not appear on the ballot again until 2011 .
2007_03_01_1829648	53	I told him I hoped we would n't have this same conversation in four years .
2007_03_01_1829648	54	He laughed and said , '' I hope four years from now , we have a conversation . ''
2007_03_01_1829649	0	Before Tuesday , Gary Matthews Jr. was mostly known for parlaying a career-best season with the Texas Rangers into a five-year , $ 50 million contract with the Los Angeles Angels , and for being his father 's son .
2007_03_01_1829649	1	But now that Matthews has been linked to a two-year investigation by the Albany County district attorney into an illegal steroid-distribution network , he is known for something else .
2007_03_01_1829649	2	In addition , fairly or unfairly , Matthews 's recent achievements as a player who had his finest season last year while turning 32 will attract increased scrutiny .
2007_03_01_1829649	3	Matthews , who is with his seventh team in nine major league seasons , has always been a slick outfielder .
2007_03_01_1829649	4	Last season , he made a you-had-to-see-it-to-believe-it catch over the center-field fence for Texas .
2007_03_01_1829649	5	But unlike his father , a 16-year veteran , Matthews did not consistently produce on offense , and he shuffled from club to club .
2007_03_01_1829649	6	That changed in 2004 .
2007_03_01_1829649	7	Matthews signed a minor league contract with the Rangers and became a starter .
2007_03_01_1829649	8	A year later , he had 17 homers and 55 runs batted in , then had a breakout season in 2006 , achieving career highs with a .313 average , 19 homers , 79 R.B.I. and 102 runs scored . ''
2007_03_01_1829649	9	We really had no reason to believe anything he did for us was anything but hard work and his natural ability , '' Texas General Manager Jon Daniels said yesterday in a telephone interview .
2007_03_01_1829649	10	Matthews was eligible for free agency , so the timing of his best season was fortunate .
2007_03_01_1829649	11	A journeyman outfielder who was released by the Atlanta Braves as recently as three years ago , Matthews was suddenly an attractive commodity .
2007_03_01_1829649	12	Before signing with the Angels , Matthews had never earned more than $ 2.5 million in a season .
2007_03_01_1829649	13	According to The Times Union of Albany , Matthews was on a customer list of a pharmacy in Orlando , Fla. , that illegally sold steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs online .
2007_03_01_1829649	14	Federal and state investigators arrested four people with ties to the pharmacy on Tuesday .
2007_03_01_1829649	15	But P. David Soares , the district attorney for Albany County , would not confirm whether Matthews was involved .
2007_03_01_1829649	16	Dr. Gary I. Wadler , an associate professor of medicine at New York University who is a member of the World Anti-Doping Agency , said one of the worst things someone could say about a professional athlete who had performed exceptionally well is that he '' must have cheated . ''
2007_03_01_1829649	17	But Wadler added that professional sports has created an environment in which athletes have been found guilty of cheating to help their performances and that others are still probably cheating .
2007_03_01_1829649	18	Because of that , Wadler said the doubts about a player like Matthews would persist . ''
2007_03_01_1829649	19	When someone deviates enough from their prior performances , it 's fair to ask questions , '' Wadler said . ''
2007_03_01_1829649	20	When their name comes up in an investigation , you have to ask more questions . ''
2007_03_01_1829649	21	Buck Showalter , who managed the Rangers last season and is now a senior adviser for the Cleveland Indians , said Matthews was an intelligent player who benefited greatly from working with Rudy Jaramillo , Texas 's highly regarded hitting coach , and from playing regularly . ''
2007_03_01_1829649	22	The potential has always been there with Gary , '' Showalter said yesterday . ''
2007_03_01_1829649	23	Gary has always been a guy that everyone knew there was more there with him .
2007_03_01_1829649	24	He 's strong and he plays hard .
2007_03_01_1829649	25	It just seemed like everything clicked for him last year . ''
2007_03_01_1829649	26	Matthews met for 15 minutes with Arte Moreno , the Angels ' owner , Manager Mike Scioscia and General Manager Bill Stoneman at the team 's spring training site in Tempe , Ariz. .
2007_03_01_1829649	27	While reading a statement to reporters , Matthews declined to answer specific questions about the article . ''
2007_03_01_1829649	28	I do expect it to resolve itself here in the near future , '' Matthews said . ''
2007_03_01_1829649	29	Until we get more information , I just ca n't comment on it . ''
2007_03_01_1829649	30	When Matthews was asked if he knew why his name was reportedly on the pharmacy 's client list , he said : '' I do n't .
2007_03_01_1829649	31	That 's exactly what were working on right now . ''
2007_03_01_1829649	32	Moreno told reporters that the Angels told Matthews that they would not ask him questions until he was ready to answer them , but that he also needed to be honest with them .
2007_03_01_1829649	33	Moreno said the Angels did not ask Matthews if he used performance enhancers . ''
2007_03_01_1829649	34	I do n't think it 's our position to do that right now , '' Moreno said . ''
2007_03_01_1829649	35	We did not address it that way . ''
2007_03_01_1829649	36	As the son of a former major leaguer , Matthews has been around major league parks and clubhouses since he was a boy .
2007_03_01_1829649	37	His father played for five teams and finished his career with 234 homers , 2,011 hits and a .281 average .
2007_03_01_1829649	38	In 2006 , the elder Matthews was the first-base coach for the Chicago Cubs , one of his former teams ; this season he will be a broadcaster for the Philadelphia Phillies , another of his former teams .
2007_03_01_1829649	39	During a game against the Houston Astros last July 1 , Matthews did his best impersonation of a superhero when he robbed Mike Lamb of a homer .
2007_03_01_1829649	40	Matthews raced toward the eight-foot-high fence in center field , leaped so high that his stomach was even with the top of the fence , and made a twisting , lunging grab .
2007_03_01_1829649	41	Joe Morgan , the Hall of Fame infielder and ESPN analyst , called it the best catch he had ever seen .
2007_03_01_1829649	42	Showalter said Matthews deserved a Gold Glove award for his superb defense .
2007_03_01_1829649	43	But , for now , Matthews 's play , his contract and his lineage are not why he is in the news .
2007_03_01_1829650	0	City health officials said yesterday that they were urgently looking for a man and a woman who dropped off a sick raccoon , which later tested positive for rabies , at an East Harlem animal shelter .
2007_03_01_1829650	1	Rabies , if left untreated , is nearly always fatal to humans .
2007_03_01_1829650	2	Officials want the man and woman to be tested and , if necessary , treated as soon as possible .
2007_03_01_1829650	3	The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene said that there had not been a case of human rabies in New York City in more than 50 years .
2007_03_01_1829650	4	If the man and woman contracted rabies from a bite or scratch from the infected raccoon , they had up to 14 days to be treated , the period when rabies shots are most effective , said Robert J. Rudd , director of the Rabies Diagnostic Laboratory in Albany .
2007_03_01_1829650	5	The lab is part of the State Department of Health .
2007_03_01_1829650	6	At least six days have already passed ; the raccoon was left at the shelter on Friday .
2007_03_01_1829650	7	The man and the woman left the shelter , at 326 East 110th Street , near Second Avenue , without identifying themselves or saying where they had found the raccoon .
2007_03_01_1829650	8	Because they wore what shelter employees described as medical scrubs , a bulletin was sent out at 3 p.m. yesterday to all city-owned hospitals and clinics .
2007_03_01_1829650	9	Shelter employees also telephoned nearby hospitals and clinics , including Metropolitan Hospital Center at 1901 First Avenue between 97th and 99th Streets , but got no clues as to the identities of the couple .
2007_03_01_1829650	10	The health department said that the raccoon was the first animal to test positive in Manhattan in 2007 ; one bat tested positive in 2006 .
2007_03_01_1829650	11	The first symptoms of rabies in humans are numbness at the bite site .
2007_03_01_1829650	12	Severe flulike symptoms come several days later , followed by death . ''
2007_03_01_1829650	13	The longer you wait after exposure , the less likely the vaccination will be successful , '' Mr. Rudd said in a telephone interview yesterday .
2007_03_01_1829650	14	About 5 p.m. Friday , a man and a woman dropped by the nonprofit Animal Care and Control shelter .
2007_03_01_1829650	15	Pedro Rosario , the shelter 's care supervisor , prepared a report on the sick raccoon .
2007_03_01_1829650	16	He said in a telephone interview yesterday that the man was white , about 5-foot-11 , with '' rusty blond hair , '' and that the woman was white , about 5-foot-8 , with brunet hair and dark brown eyes .
2007_03_01_1829650	17	They carried the raccoon , wrapped in a white and tan blanket , in a tan and pink plastic pet carrier .
2007_03_01_1829650	18	The raccoon was sent to the city health department on Tuesday and the positive rabies results were disclosed yesterday .
2007_03_01_1829650	19	The animal was euthanized as part of the test .
2007_03_01_1829650	20	Mr. Rosario said the man and woman drove '' an old Honda Accord '' that appeared brown or burgundy .
2007_03_01_1829650	21	No one recorded a license plate number , he said .
2007_03_01_1829650	22	The shelter was busy at that hour , Mr. Rosario said .
2007_03_01_1829650	23	A shelter worker took the raccoon to the medical department and returned to the waiting room . ''
2007_03_01_1829650	24	By the time we came back to finish up intake , '' Mr. Rosario said , the man and woman were gone .
2007_03_01_1829650	25	Rabies has had a recent resurgence in New York City .
2007_03_01_1829650	26	There were 44 cases of rabies-infected animals in 2006 , about 80 percent of them in Staten Island .
2007_03_01_1829650	27	That is up from 28 in 2005 , nearly all of them in the Bronx , the city health department said .
2007_03_01_1829650	28	Rabid animals were epidemic in New York State in the early 1990s , Mr. Rudd of the rabies lab said .
2007_03_01_1829650	29	The disease peaked in 1993 with 2,747 rabid animals .
2007_03_01_1829651	0	Responding to several highly publicized cases in which young people met harm or death , the City Council passed three measures yesterday intended to make nightclubs safer and to crack down on negligent club owners .
2007_03_01_1829651	1	One of the measures requires cabarets and dance halls to install video surveillance cameras at all entrances and exits .
2007_03_01_1829651	2	Another measure allows the city to place independent monitors in clubs that have multiple or serious violations of the cabaret licensing laws .
2007_03_01_1829651	3	The final one would expand nuisance abatement laws to shut down businesses that sell fake identification to minors .
2007_03_01_1829651	4	Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said he was likely to sign the measures but had to read the final wording first . ''
2007_03_01_1829651	5	Clubs unfortunately have had a -- some of them have been centers of drug dealing and of fights and of behavior that 's just not acceptable , '' he said . ''
2007_03_01_1829651	6	And giving us the tools we need to stop altercations and to make sure that people are n't breaking the law , those kinds of things probably should be done . ''
2007_03_01_1829651	7	Violence connected with city nightclubs has received increasing attention since the death of Imette St. Guillen just over a year ago .
2007_03_01_1829651	8	Ms. St. Guillen , 24 , a graduate student at John Jay College of Criminal Justice , was found dead in Brooklyn 17 hours after leaving the Falls , a bar in SoHo .
2007_03_01_1829651	9	Darryl Littlejohn , who was employed as a bouncer at the club despite having a criminal record , has been indicted in her murder .
2007_03_01_1829651	10	In response , the Council has strengthened laws requiring criminal background checks of bouncers and security guards .
2007_03_01_1829651	11	The Council also held a conference called Safer Nights , Safer City , seeking ways to make the industry safer .
2007_03_01_1829651	12	While many nightclubs already have surveillance cameras , club owners have objected to the requirement that the Council approved yesterday , saying it would unfairly affect all clubs for the actions of a few negligent owners .
2007_03_01_1829651	13	Some club patrons have also raised concerns that the cameras would invade their privacy .
2007_03_01_1829651	14	The surveillance measure would require clubs to safeguard video recordings to give law enforcement more information for prosecutions .
2007_03_01_1829651	15	The independent monitoring rule would require clubs with multiple or severe violations to hire an independent monitor selected by the police commissioner as a condition of renewing its license .
2007_03_01_1829651	16	The monitor , hired at the club 's expense , would investigate the club 's operations and make recommendations about how to make it safer and help it meet licensing regulations .
2007_03_01_1829651	17	In an effort to reduce excessive drinking , the Council also approved a nonbinding resolution calling on the State Liquor Authority to limit clubs ' practice of requiring patrons to buy full bottles , not individual drinks .
2007_03_01_1829651	18	Council Speaker Christine C. Quinn said yesterday 's package of bills means '' to make sure that New York City will continue to have the safest , most exciting night life in the world . ''
2007_03_01_1829652	0	Dozens of colorful photos and drawings depicting families led by gay couples were rehung on the tan walls of a sandwich shop here on Wednesday , ending a three-day dust-up over art , commerce and politics .
2007_03_01_1829652	1	The artwork , called '' The Family Album , '' was hung on Sunday in the shop , Cosi , by Empire State Pride Agenda as part of an effort to push for the legalization of same-sex marriage in New York .
2007_03_01_1829652	2	But on Tuesday , organizers were told that the display was being taken down .
2007_03_01_1829652	3	Pride Agenda and the LOFT , a service and advocacy center for gay and transgender residents of the Lower Hudson Valley , said the decision was a knee-jerk reaction by company officials to complaints from patrons .
2007_03_01_1829652	4	Cosi officials said their decision was based solely on company policy on the loan of corporate space to artists .
2007_03_01_1829652	5	They said the works had been hung without formal approval from a district manager . ''
2007_03_01_1829652	6	We do n't care about content , '' said Robert Speirs , a regional vice president of Cosi .
2007_03_01_1829652	7	Mr. Speirs said a district manager must usually approve a display 's color and symmetry before the works are hung .
2007_03_01_1829652	8	In this case , the store 's manager had given approval .
2007_03_01_1829652	9	On Wednesday , Cosi agreed that the art could be reinstalled as long as it met Cosi standards .
2007_03_01_1829652	10	So around noon at the Quaker Ridge Road shop , Mr. Speirs directed Diana Wilkins , who works at the LOFT , as she arranged the unframed works .
2007_03_01_1829652	11	She held up one that she and her partner , Emily Blake , had created , featuring a color photo of them in formal wear and mounted on a purple matte board with a rainbow border .
2007_03_01_1829652	12	Below the picture was a quote about commitment from the movie '' Runaway Bride . '' ''
2007_03_01_1829652	13	We want to have the choice to get married when that time comes , '' Ms. Wilkins said .
2007_03_01_1829652	14	A bill to legalize same-sex marriage in New York has been introduced in the Legislature in past years but has never come up for a vote , partly because a related court case was pending .
2007_03_01_1829652	15	Assemblyman Richard N. Gottfried , a Manhattan Democrat , said this might be the year .
2007_03_01_1829652	16	Mr. Gottfried said he had 33 co-sponsors for his bill this session , 11 more than last year . ''
2007_03_01_1829652	17	I think we are shifting gears to where we can seriously discuss bringing the bill to the Assembly floor for a vote , '' he said .
2007_03_01_1829652	18	State Senator Thomas K. Duane , a Manhattan Democrat , said he had at least a dozen co-sponsors for the bill in the Senate .
2007_03_01_1829652	19	Gov. Eliot Spitzer said during his campaign that he supported same-sex marriage , and civil unions are now being allowed in New Jersey for the first time .
2007_03_01_1829652	20	Empire State Pride Agenda said that similar artwork was on display in six other businesses across the state in advance of a May 1 rally at the State Capitol to support the New York legislation .
2007_03_01_1829652	21	Jeanne Sparks , a New Rochelle resident , was in Cosi on Wednesday to see the display , and said she would not return until it comes down at the end of March . ''
2007_03_01_1829652	22	I have chosen not to spend my money at Cosi , and I would encourage anyone else who believes in traditional marriage to do likewise , '' Ms. Sparks said .
2007_03_01_1829652	23	She said she discussed the Scriptures with a Unitarian Universalist minister at the shop and told the minister she believes that homosexuality can be reversed . ''
2007_03_01_1829652	24	I know personally many ex-gays , '' Ms. Sparks said . ''
2007_03_01_1829652	25	I believe change is possible . ''
2007_03_01_1829652	26	The minister , the Rev. Debra Morra , said she supported same-sex marriage . ''
2007_03_01_1829652	27	This is a pro-family exhibit , '' she said . ''
2007_03_01_1829652	28	People need to see that gay and lesbian families are the same as other families . ''
2007_03_01_1829652	29	Also at Cosi were Carolina Cordero Dyer and her 2-year-old twins .
2007_03_01_1829652	30	Ms. Dyer had created a poster with drawings and photos of herself , the twins and her partner , Claudia Glaser .
2007_03_01_1829652	31	Ms. Dyer and Ms. Glaser , the twins ' biological mother , married in 2005 in Canada . ''
2007_03_01_1829652	32	It was n't easy to come here , '' she said at a noon news conference at the restaurant that had been planned as a protest before Cosi 's reversal . ''
2007_03_01_1829652	33	But I am committed to making sure my family has available all of the things that other families have . ''
2007_03_01_1829653	0	A man whose conviction last year on two counts of murder was a rare exception to the rule in drunken driving cases was sentenced here today to a prison term of 18 years to life .
2007_03_01_1829653	1	The man , Martin Heidgen , 25 , had faced a minimum of 15 years to life in prison and a maximum of 25 years to life for the crash on July 2 , 2005 , in which he plowed his pickup truck into a limousine carrying a family home from a wedding reception .
2007_03_01_1829653	2	He was drunk and going the wrong way on the Meadowbrook Parkway .
2007_03_01_1829653	3	Before passing sentence , the judge , Alan L. Honorof , an acting State Supreme Court justice in Nassau County , said Mr. Heidgen 's crime was notable for displaying a '' pure , blatant , callous , wanton disregard for human life . ''
2007_03_01_1829653	4	But he also observed that the defendant had no prior criminal record and '' did n't intend to take the lives of Stanley Rabinowitz and Kate Flynn , '' the limousine driver and the 7-year-old flower girl who were killed in the crash .
2007_03_01_1829653	5	The little girl 's father , Neil Flynn , who was injured in the crash and attended each day of the six-week trial with a group of two or three dozen relatives and friends , denounced the sentence and the judge who imposed it as cowardly . ''
2007_03_01_1829653	6	He did the worst thing he could have done -- he compromised , '' said Mr. Flynn , who is a personal injury lawyer . ''
2007_03_01_1829653	7	Instead of taking a stand , he took the cowardly way out .
2007_03_01_1829653	8	I have nothing but contempt for him . ''
2007_03_01_1829653	9	Kate Flynn 's grandparents were also seriously injured .
2007_03_01_1829653	10	The sentencing followed a full day of extraordinary presentencing statements by relatives of both the victim and Mr. Heidgen .
2007_03_01_1829653	11	Mr. Flynn 's statement was the most blunt in expressing his anger and his despair at the loss of his child .
2007_03_01_1829653	12	In a hushed courtroom , reading from a prepared statement , he said that after the crash , in which he suffered a broken back , '' I begged the rescue workers and medical personnel to let me die .
2007_03_01_1829653	13	Today the only thing that keeps me from suicide is the responsibility of raising my other children . ''
2007_03_01_1829653	14	Kate was the oldest of four .
2007_03_01_1829653	15	Mr. Flynn 's wife , Jennifer , described -- as she had done as a witness during the trial -- how her daughter was decapitated .
2007_03_01_1829653	16	On Mr. Heidgen 's behalf , his mother , father and stepfather stood to describe a thoughtful , generous young man who volunteered helping underprivileged children during high school , and coaching a children 's soccer team while in college . ''
2007_03_01_1829653	17	He is a good person who did a bad thing , '' said his mother , Margot Aponte , who lives in Valley Stream .
2007_03_01_1829653	18	She said that when Mr. Heidgen drove the wrong way on the parkway , he was lost in unfamiliar territory , but never intended to hurt anyone .
2007_03_01_1829653	19	Mr. Heidgen , who worked as an insurance salesman in Manhattan , grew up in Little Rock , Ark. , attended the University of Mississippi and moved to Long Island to be near his remarried mother shortly before the crash .
2007_03_01_1829653	20	He had been out drinking with friends , and his blood alcohol level was three times the legal limit .
2007_03_01_1829653	21	Denis Dillon , the Nassau County district attorney at the time , charged Mr. Heidgen with two counts of '' murder by depraved indifference , '' a felony that carries the same penalty as intentional murder .
2007_03_01_1829653	22	The charge is frequently used in drive-by shootings , where the intent to kill a specific person would be hard to prove .
2007_03_01_1829653	23	But it is rarely used in drunken driving cases .
2007_03_01_1829653	24	Mr. Dillon attributed his decision to the fact that Mr. Heidgen was so severely drunk , and that he continued to drive the wrong way despite warnings , honking and near-misses along the parkway .
2007_03_01_1829653	25	Prosecutors contended that Mr. Heidgen was suicidal and intentionally aimed his truck at the limousine .
2007_03_01_1829653	26	But Mr. Heidgen 's lawyers suggested that such severe charges were brought at least in part under the pressure of a tight re-election campaign in which Mr. Dillon 's opponent , Kathleen Rice , who won , was accusing him of being too soft on drunken drivers .
2007_03_01_1829653	27	In their appeals for mercy , Mr. Heidgen 's family and his lawyer , Stephen LaMagna , of Garden City , cited a dozen fatal crashes locally in the 20 months since Mr. Heidgen 's crash , in which drunken drivers were charged with lesser crimes than murder , usually manslaughter , which carries a maximum 15-year prison sentence .
2007_03_01_1829653	28	But it was exactly that state of affairs that the Flynn family said they had hoped to shake up . ''
2007_03_01_1829653	29	We have been tolerating drunk driving with insufficient jail time , inadequate charges and ridiculous self-improvement classes , '' Mrs. Flynn said in court on Wednesday .
2007_03_01_1829654	0	Faced with mounting criticism from parents over recent changes in school bus routes and plans to reorganize the city school system , Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg named a veteran education advocate yesterday to represent them at the Department of Education .
2007_03_01_1829654	1	Martine G. Guerrier , 36 , will have the title of chief family engagement officer .
2007_03_01_1829654	2	She was previously the communications director and Albany legislative representative for the Educational Priorities Panel , an advocacy group for New York City 's public schools .
2007_03_01_1829654	3	For the past three years , she also has been the Brooklyn borough president 's appointee to the city 's Panel for Educational Policy , where she most notably voted against the mayor 's plan in 2004 to hold back third graders largely on the basis of test scores .
2007_03_01_1829654	4	Ms. Guerrier , who will earn $ 150,000 in her new post , was accompanied to the announcement by her 10-year-old son , Domenic , a fifth grader at Public School 133 in Brooklyn .
2007_03_01_1829654	5	She suggested that had her new post existed a few months ago , the city might have waited until September to change school bus routes . ''
2007_03_01_1829654	6	I do n't know that that decision would have been made in the same way had there been a parent at the table , '' she said . ''
2007_03_01_1829654	7	And I think that 's one of the great benefits of having me there . ''
2007_03_01_1829654	8	Ms. Guerrier 's appointment came just hours before a raucous rally at St. Vartan 's Cathedral in Manhattan , where more than 1,000 politicians , parents , community activists and teachers protested Mr. Bloomberg 's plans to further overhaul the city school system .
2007_03_01_1829654	9	At the rally , the city comptroller , William C. Thompson Jr. , mocked the mayor 's multiple efforts to reorganize the schools . ''
2007_03_01_1829654	10	I have n't seen this many parents and teachers and students together in over five years , '' he said .
2007_03_01_1829654	11	Randi Weingarten , president of the United Federation of Teachers , described for the rally a meeting yesterday at which she and other organizers met with Schools Chancellor Joel I. Klein to voice their complaints . ''
2007_03_01_1829654	12	The chancellor said he will listen , '' she said . ''
2007_03_01_1829654	13	But will he really hear us ? ''
2007_03_01_1829654	14	Earlier , in announcing Ms. Guerrier 's appointment , Mr. Bloomberg said city schools had made great strides in reaching out to parents under his leadership , particularly by placing '' parent coordinators '' in every school . ''
2007_03_01_1829654	15	Rising test scores and improving graduation rates in schools across the city show that we really are on the right track , '' the mayor said . ''
2007_03_01_1829654	16	But we can do more , and we must do more , to make parents full partners in their children 's education , and we realize that there are a lot of parents in the city who agree . ''
2007_03_01_1829654	17	But Mr. Bloomberg 's critics said Ms. Guerrier 's appointment -- and the fact that it was announced by the mayor , and not simply by Mr. Klein , to whom Ms. Guerrier will report -- signals that the administration recognizes that parents feel shut out .
2007_03_01_1829654	18	And those parents , the critics say , could be a liability when mayoral control of the school system comes up for legislative renewal in 2009 . ''
2007_03_01_1829654	19	I do n't know how you could interpret this as anything but an admission of failure on their part , '' said Tim Johnson , chairman of the Chancellor 's Parent Advisory Council .
2007_03_01_1829654	20	Referring to Ms. Guerrier 's job , he added : '' Parents are not looking for another bureaucrat to manage us .
2007_03_01_1829654	21	We do n't need to be managed , we need parents to be empowered . ''
2007_03_01_1829654	22	Merryl H. Tisch , a member of the Board of Regents from New York City who is generally a supporter of Mr. Bloomberg , said the creation of Ms. Guerrier 's position seemed to indicate that Mr. Bloomberg '' understands full well that without the parents he stands to lose legislative renewal of mayoral control . '' ''
2007_03_01_1829654	23	They are being proactive in trying to head off what I think is mounting parental resistance to this reorganization , '' Ms. Tisch continued . ''
2007_03_01_1829654	24	I think it 's a smart thing to do . ''
2007_03_01_1829654	25	Mr. Bloomberg said that parental involvement had been a priority '' from Day 1 '' and that Ms. Guerrier 's appointment was simply the latest effort to reach out . ''
2007_03_01_1829654	26	I think you can always find a handful of parents who are politically active and want to be involved who do not feel that they are running the schools the way that they used to many years ago , '' Mr. Bloomberg said . ''
2007_03_01_1829654	27	Most parents , '' he added , '' really are pleased , and you can see it in that most parents are staying in the city .
2007_03_01_1829654	28	They 're not leaving , and they 're sending their kids to public school . ''
2007_03_01_1829654	29	When asked about the mayor 's comments about parents being pleased , Ms. Guerrier initially replied , '' I do n't think he said that . ''
2007_03_01_1829654	30	But when she was assured that he had , she said , '' I would say that most parents have concerns and issues that need to be addressed . ''
2007_03_01_1829654	31	I would say that there is an opportunity to do things better . ''
2007_03_01_1829655	0	Ben S. Bernanke , the chairman of the Federal Reserve , said on Wednesday that he saw little cause for alarm in either the previous day 's stock market plunge or new evidence of slowing economic growth .
2007_03_01_1829655	1	Mr. Bernanke 's soothing comments helped lift share prices and recapture some of the ground they lost on Tuesday .
2007_03_01_1829655	2	His remarks contrasted with the more pessimistic tone of his predecessor , Alan Greenspan , who cautioned on Monday that a recession was a possibility . ''
2007_03_01_1829655	3	We are looking for moderate growth in the U.S. economy going forward , '' Mr. Bernanke told a Congressional hearing , adding that '' there 's a reasonable possibility that we 'll see some strengthening of the economy '' toward the middle of the year .
2007_03_01_1829655	4	Though Mr. Greenspan did not go so far as to predict a recession , the mere fact that he mentioned the word was enough to aggravate a global market downswing that began in Shanghai .
2007_03_01_1829655	5	Mr. Bernanke expressed little alarm about the plunge , telling lawmakers that '' there did n't seem to be any single trigger '' for Tuesday 's market rout and that markets '' seem to be working well , normally . ''
2007_03_01_1829655	6	Nor did Mr. Bernanke betray any worry about a new report by the Commerce Department , which sharply lowered its estimate of growth during the final quarter of 2006 to 2.2 percent from its earlier estimate of 3.5 percent .
2007_03_01_1829655	7	The downward revision , which stemmed in part from new changes in estimates of inventory-building activities by businesses , were roughly in line with predictions by Wall Street analysts .
2007_03_01_1829655	8	But Mr. Bernanke went further , saying the downward revision had actually bolstered the Federal Reserve 's view that the economy was poised for mildly slower growth as well as a slight decline in inflationary pressures . ''
2007_03_01_1829655	9	My view is that -- taking all the new data into account -- that there is really no material change in our expectations about the U.S. economy , '' he said . ''
2007_03_01_1829655	10	I would add parenthetically that the downward revision of the fourth-quarter G.D.P. numbers we got this morning is actually more consistent with our overall view of the economy than were the original numbers . ''
2007_03_01_1829655	11	The Federal Reserve 's forecast calls for the economy to expand by 2.5 to 3 percent in 2007 , down from about 3 percent last year , and for the unemployment rate to remain below 5 percent -- a level that many economists say is roughly equal to full employment .
2007_03_01_1829655	12	Fed officials are hoping to achieve a soft landing for the economy , with the underlying pace of inflation slowing to about 2 percent over the next year from about 2.6 percent over the last 12 months .
2007_03_01_1829655	13	Mr. Bernanke 's sanguine comments on Wednesday seemed at odds with those of Mr. Greenspan , who spoke by satellite on Monday to a conference in Hong Kong .
2007_03_01_1829655	14	Though he stepped down as Fed chairman more than a year ago , Mr. Greenspan 's remarks can still move markets . ''
2007_03_01_1829655	15	When you get this far away from a recession , invariably forces build up for the next recession , and indeed we are beginning to see that sign , '' he said , according to The Associated Press .
2007_03_01_1829655	16	But Mr. Greenspan stopped short of predicting a recession , saying that he could not rule out the possibility even though forecasters were not predicting one .
2007_03_01_1829655	17	His point seemed to be to caution investors against being too complacent , a theme he stressed in the months before he stepped down last year .
2007_03_01_1829655	18	Timothy Geithner , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , echoed Mr. Bernanke 's calm about the economy . ''
2007_03_01_1829655	19	The U.S. economy has demonstrated and continues to demonstrate remarkable resilience , '' Mr. Geithner said in a speech at a conference on risk management .
2007_03_01_1829655	20	Many economists agree with Mr. Bernanke that the economy is likely to keep expanding , though probably at a pace of less than 3 percent for at least the first half of this year .
2007_03_01_1829655	21	In general , the government 's sharp downward revision of growth in the final months of last year came as little surprise .
2007_03_01_1829655	22	Almost half of the revision reflected data showing that companies increased their inventories less than had been assumed .
2007_03_01_1829655	23	But that can actually spur growth in subsequent quarters , as manufacturers increase production to restock .
2007_03_01_1829655	24	More disturbing was a bigger-than-expected drop in spending on capital goods , which declined 3.2 percent rather than the 1.8 percent originally estimated .
2007_03_01_1829655	25	Lower capital spending could be an indicator of a slowdown in business investment , at a time when Fed officials are counting on business investment to offset the sharp drop in home building .
2007_03_01_1829655	26	In a separate report , the Commerce Department reported that sales of new homes fell 16.6 percent in January -- the biggest drop since 1994 .
2007_03_01_1829655	27	Fed officials have expressed cautious optimism that the housing market is beginning to stabilize after a big decline .
2007_03_01_1829655	28	But the central bank is steering through a delicate transition , with inventories of unsold houses at high levels and rising anxiety about the volume of subprime mortgages granted to people with comparatively low incomes and weak credit ratings .
2007_03_01_1829655	29	Mr. Bernanke acknowledged concern about the subprime market , where several lenders have closed and others have been forced to increase reserves for bad loans .
2007_03_01_1829655	30	But the Fed chairman said he saw no sign yet that problems with subprime mortgages were leading to problems in the broader economy .
2007_03_01_1829655	31	Nariman Behravesh , chief economist for Global Insight in Lexington , Mass. , said that Mr. Bernanke appeared to have had a calming effect on investors . ''
2007_03_01_1829655	32	The measure of Bernanke 's effect was that on a day when the economic news was not particularly good , the market was up , '' Mr. Behravesh said . ''
2007_03_01_1829655	33	His message was that we seem to be on track , do n't overreact and do n't panic . ''
2007_03_01_1829656	0	In an annual rite that is still going strong , Girl Scouts across the country have kicked off their 90th season of cookie sales -- but with some modern entrepreneurial twists .
2007_03_01_1829656	1	The Thin Mints , Samoas , Tagalongs and other cookie stalwarts remain remarkably the same ( although trans fats were removed this year ) .
2007_03_01_1829656	2	And Girl Scout cookies remain a sales juggernaut : some 200 million boxes now generate $ 700 million in sales yearly .
2007_03_01_1829656	3	But the Scouts , with a sales force of 2.7 million , have moved from traditional box-by-box selling methods to more varied approaches to get bulk sales .
2007_03_01_1829656	4	Now there are cookie academies and cookie colleges , as well as more intense sessions in marketing , selling and business skills for girls 11 and over .
2007_03_01_1829656	5	The cookie season today is all about individual entrepreneurship -- using cookie selling to teach Girl Scouts how to manage money , create a business plan and win customers .
2007_03_01_1829656	6	Kicking off the selling season , a Kentucky Scout group last month held a five-hour cookie college in three cities , with 10 classes in marketing , money management , goal setting and the etiquette of approaching customers .
2007_03_01_1829656	7	In January , 600 Girl Scouts attended a one-day cookie college in Sacramento , sponsored by Merrill Lynch ; the seminars included '' Entrepreneur 101 '' and '' Creative Marketing . ''
2007_03_01_1829656	8	Displaying the entrepreneurial flair the Scouts movement encourages , Sarah Cain , 16 , reaped a batch of orders last year from local businesses in her hometown , Arlington , Wash. , north of Seattle .
2007_03_01_1829656	9	She found a number of car dealership listings when she researched possible customers in the phone book , and , she said , that gave her the idea of '' asking them to give a box to people who take a test drive . ''
2007_03_01_1829656	10	Stephen C. Brown , general sales manager of Smokey Point Buick Pontiac GMC , bought eight cases initially ( there are 12 boxes of cookies in a case , and a box costs $ 2.50 to $ 4 depending on locale ) then ordered four more cases after he ran out . ''
2007_03_01_1829656	11	My understanding of Girl Scout cookies was one box at a time in front of a grocery store , '' Mr. Brown said , '' but she went for volume and bulk . ''
2007_03_01_1829656	12	For this cookie-selling season ( which usually begins in February or March ) , Ms. Cain has prepared a Power Point presentation and is aiming at hotels -- she is already lining up appointments -- hoping to persuade them that every room needs a box of familiar cookie comfort .
2007_03_01_1829656	13	Ms. Cain , a high school sophomore , who hopes this year to nearly double her sales -- from 1,114 boxes to 2,000 boxes -- is among the youthful cookie-sellers who are using innovative methods to sell large quantities of the boxes .
2007_03_01_1829656	14	The proceeds go for Scout activities and special trips .
2007_03_01_1829656	15	Scouts who make a certain number of sales may receive small prizes like a T-shirt .
2007_03_01_1829656	16	Leah Koch , 14 , of Chicago uses e-mail messages to snag cookie orders .
2007_03_01_1829656	17	Starting two years ago , in sixth grade , Ms. Koch began e-mailing a list of prospects , drawing on names from previous order forms .
2007_03_01_1829656	18	She went from selling 700 boxes a year to 1,000 .
2007_03_01_1829656	19	Then , expanding her e-mail efforts , sales zoomed up to 1,510 last year -- making her a top seller locally . ''
2007_03_01_1829656	20	It saves me time , '' she said of e-mailing , '' because I used to make a lot of phone calls , and people were n't there so I would have to call back again .
2007_03_01_1829656	21	Now people respond when they 're ready to order . ''
2007_03_01_1829656	22	Officially , Internet sales are banned -- although cookies can still be found on eBay -- because the Scout umbrella group , the Girl Scouts of the USA , wants to forestall confusion over the cookies ' price .
2007_03_01_1829656	23	Even so , the scouting movement moved this year to expand its Web presence , setting up www.girlscoutcookies.org , so buyers can use their ZIP code to find their nearest cookie-selling troop .
2007_03_01_1829656	24	For the first time this year , the Scouts also posted vintage cookie ads and other information on social-networking Web sites including MySpace , YouTube and Friendster .
2007_03_01_1829656	25	But the essence of cookie sales is still on the ground .
2007_03_01_1829656	26	The stepped-up sales training was prompted by teenage Scouts who wanted to sell cookies but had limited time because of schoolwork and sports , and also who found they had tough competition from adorable little Brownies ( who also sell Girl Scout cookies ) .
2007_03_01_1829656	27	In 2001 , the Girl Scouts Tres Condados Council in Santa Barbara , Calif. -- one of 315 councils across the country -- developed an initiative that became the C.E.O. in Training Program , to teach entrepreneurship fundamentals .
2007_03_01_1829656	28	Grace Tynan , 16 , a Tres Condados Scout , took part in the program , where , with one-on-one mentoring , she learned how to set a sales goal , find prospects among local businesses and service organizations , make appointments , create a sample script for telephone contacts , prepare and make a presentation , take orders , coordinate deliveries and make a final report .
2007_03_01_1829656	29	Her pitch , which she used successfully last year with a local bank and realty firm , was to provide cookies as incentives for employees , as a treat at the company 's weekly staff meeting or to show client appreciation . ''
2007_03_01_1829656	30	This has really helped me understand business , '' she said .
2007_03_01_1829656	31	And that 's exactly what it should do , according to Katherine Cloninger , the Girl Scouts chief executive , who says cookie selling fosters independence , self-esteem and confidence . ''
2007_03_01_1829656	32	We see this as a cutting-edge leadership experience , '' she said .
2007_03_01_1829656	33	And it is often a girl 's first exposure to the working world , where women own about 10.6 million businesses , according to government data .
2007_03_01_1829656	34	That and the number of Girl Scout alumnae among women executives and members of Congress have encouraged the Scout movement to recruit mentors .
2007_03_01_1829656	35	Last year , Catherine M. Coughlin , president and chief executive of AT&T Midwest , along with some sales and marketing colleagues , gave feedback on the sales plans of a dozen Chicago-area girl scouts , including Leah Koch .
2007_03_01_1829656	36	They plan to do so again this year .
2007_03_01_1829656	37	Ms. Coughlin , a former Girl Scout , said : '' Selling cookies used to be pounding the pavement , calling on family and friends , but now these girls really know so much more . ''
2007_03_01_1829656	38	We asked one girl , for example , how she defined success .
2007_03_01_1829656	39	And she said : ` We have to make more money than we spend , ' '' said Ms. Coughlin , adding '' I wish everyone in business was that smart . ''
2007_03_01_1829656	40	Members of the National Association of Women Business Owners are mentoring girls in Chesapeake , Va. , where Deborah Mollura , who owns a custom gift basket business , is helping local Scouts put together cookie gift baskets -- complete with recipes -- to attract large orders from local companies .
2007_03_01_1829656	41	Scouts are also looking for customers at new sales sites , away from the usual like grocery stores .
2007_03_01_1829656	42	In Chicago , Girl Scouts will be selling cookies at downtown office buildings like the Sears Tower .
2007_03_01_1829656	43	Troops in other parts of the country have set up sales booths in tax preparation offices , churches , barber shops , beauty salons and even at marathons .
2007_03_01_1829656	44	Despite the emphasis on training , sometimes entrepreneurial moxie just mixes with chance , as happened to Kaitlyn Richardson , 9 , who was at her mother 's office in Springfield , Va. , early last year when a marketing director for Paxton Van Lines asked her mother for corporate client gift ideas . ''
2007_03_01_1829656	45	I thought about Thin Mints because they come in a green box , '' she said , '' and that would be good for St. Patrick 's Day . ''
2007_03_01_1829656	46	So she piped up with her suggestion , and Frederick D. Paxton , the marketing officer , agreed that they would be great in the company 's holiday gift bag for corporate relocation directors . ''
2007_03_01_1829656	47	Everybody enjoys them , '' said Mr. Paxton , whose order for 320 boxes more than doubled the amount of cookies that Kaitlyn already hadsold , '' and the money goes to a good cause . ''
2007_03_01_1829657	0	The European Union announced plans on Wednesday to cut the number of peacekeeping troops in Bosnia and Herzegovina by almost two-thirds , citing an improved security situation .
2007_03_01_1829657	1	Troop levels would decline from the current 6,800 to about 2,500 by June , a spokesman for the European force said in Sarajevo , the capital .
2007_03_01_1829657	2	The reduction was announced by the Union 's military staff in Brussels and followed a positive assessment of Bosnia 's security situation in December by foreign ministers .
2007_03_01_1829657	3	A statement released in Brussels said the Union would be prepared to '' re-establish a more robust military presence if needed '' in the months after the reduction .
2007_03_01_1829657	4	More than a decade after Bosnia 's civil war ended , most major analysts say the risk of renewed conflict is low , though ethnic tensions remain high .
2007_03_01_1829657	5	The European Union took over the principal peacekeeping role from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in December 2004 ; it is the only military operation led by the Union .
2007_03_01_1829657	6	NATO retains a headquarters in Sarajevo with a staff of close to 100 people .
2007_03_01_1829657	7	The European Union 's military wing is regarded by some governments as an important addition to the 27 nations ' common foreign and military policy , providing an alternative to NATO .
2007_03_01_1829657	8	Some members contend that NATO is too heavily dominated by the United States .
2007_03_01_1829657	9	But with increased demands on Europe to provide more troops for the NATO-led force in Afghanistan , some members are eager to reduce their troop levels in Bosnia .
2007_03_01_1829657	10	News reports on Wednesday in Britain , attributed to unnamed government officials , said London planned to withdraw its contingent of 600 soldiers from Bosnia , presumably as part of the overall reduction announced Wednesday .
2007_03_01_1829657	11	On Monday , Britain announced that it was sending 1,400 more troops to Afghanistan , bringing its deployment there to 7,700 .
2007_03_01_1829657	12	Tensions between Bosnia 's three main ethnic groups -- Croats , Muslims and Serbs -- have increased in the past several months , beginning with the campaign period before the parliamentary elections on Oct. 1 .
2007_03_01_1829657	13	Those continuing rifts , and the failure of the major political parties to agree on major changes to the Constitution to simplify political structures , and to form a unified national police force , have prompted international authorities to retain their extensive powers in Bosnia .
2007_03_01_1829657	14	On Tuesday , the 55-nation Peace Implementation Council , set up after the civil war to help carry out the transition to peace , announced that it would extend its Office of the High Representative , Bosnia 's most senior international official , for another year .
2007_03_01_1829657	15	The official has the right to make laws and dismiss local politicians .
2007_03_01_1829657	16	The council had planned to phase out those powers this year .
2007_03_01_1829659	0	A simple , inexpensive and surprisingly powerful combination of treatments all but wiped out malaria in a group of H.I.V.-positive children in a study in Uganda , scientists are reporting .
2007_03_01_1829659	1	The combination -- taking one inexpensive antibiotic pill each day and sleeping under an insecticide-treated mosquito net -- reduced the incidence of malaria by 97 percent compared with a control group , Dr. Anne Gasasira , an AIDS researcher at Makerere University in Kampala , Uganda , said at a medical conference here on Wednesday .
2007_03_01_1829659	2	She said the findings had already changed medical practice there .
2007_03_01_1829659	3	But scientists said they had not yet determined whether the treatment would be as effective in H.I.V.-negative children with malaria .
2007_03_01_1829659	4	The antibiotic is known as cotrimoxazole , which is sold in the United States as Bactrim and Septra .
2007_03_01_1829659	5	It is used to prevent infections that are common complications of AIDS .
2007_03_01_1829659	6	The drug also has known benefits against the parasite that causes malaria . ''
2007_03_01_1829659	7	The findings were shockingly dramatic , '' said Dr. Elaine Abrams , a professor of pediatrics and epidemiology at Columbia University .
2007_03_01_1829659	8	Dr. Abrams was not connected with the Uganda study and moderated the session where the findings were reported , at the 14th Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections .
2007_03_01_1829659	9	Dr. Abrams and other experts said the findings had implications for better controlling malaria in Africa .
2007_03_01_1829659	10	Malaria is the leading cause of illness and death among children under 5 in Uganda , Dr. Gasasira said .
2007_03_01_1829659	11	Although the World Health Organization does not recommend the combination , the United Nations agency does recommend each measure separately -- cotrimoxazole for H.I.V. in Africa and bed nets to prevent malaria in infected areas .
2007_03_01_1829659	12	Generic forms of cotrimoxazole cost less than $ 10 per patient each year in Uganda and the bed nets about $ 5 , Dr. Gasasira said in an interview .
2007_03_01_1829659	13	Because there are known interactions involving AIDS , malaria and other diseases , researchers have broadened their studies in Africa to find better ways to treat and prevent them .
2007_03_01_1829659	14	The findings also extend to an earlier study that found a reduced frequency of malaria among H.I.V.-infected adults in Uganda who took the antibiotic and slept under bed nets .
2007_03_01_1829659	15	Dr. Jonathan Mermin of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta led the adult study , which was published in The Lancet last year .
2007_03_01_1829659	16	But Dr. Gasasira said that because the adult and pediatric studies used different methodologies , the findings could not be directly compared .
2007_03_01_1829659	17	Her study found that among 561 healthy children who were assumed not to be H.I.V.-infected and who did not take the antibiotic and sleep under bed nets , there were 356 episodes of malaria .
2007_03_01_1829659	18	This compared with four episodes among 300 children who were known to be H.I.V.-infected .
2007_03_01_1829659	19	The 97 percent reduction was calculated by including other factors like the time they were under observation in the study that began in October 2005 .
2007_03_01_1829659	20	The data were measured as of last August , but the study is continuing to determine if the findings hold up over a longer period .
2007_03_01_1829659	21	Additional studies are planned .
2007_03_01_1829659	22	The infected children also received antiretroviral therapy , Dr. Gasasira said .
2007_03_01_1829659	23	Her team included researchers from the University of California at San Francisco and was paid for by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda , Md. .
2007_03_01_1829659	24	The study came up with another important finding on the relationship between fever and malaria .
2007_03_01_1829659	25	Only 4 percent of fevers were from malaria among children who received the combination therapy in the study .
2007_03_01_1829659	26	In the past , doctors assumed that a child who came to a clinic for fever in Uganda had malaria until it was proved otherwise .
2007_03_01_1829659	27	But because malaria was far less common among the participants who received the combination therapy , Dr. Gasasira said , doctors now assume that any fever in a young child must be investigated for a cause other than malaria .
2007_03_01_1829659	28	Dr. Abrams , the Columbia expert , said in an interview that the Uganda findings had additional implications for treating H.I.V.-infected children in malarious areas .
2007_03_01_1829659	29	Because pediatricians are concerned that prolonged use of cotrimoxazole could lead to resistant malaria , they often stop the drug among AIDS patients when tests show significant improvement in the health of their immune system after antiretroviral therapy . ''
2007_03_01_1829659	30	This data will make us reconsider whether to stop cotrimoxazole '' in such circumstances , she said .
2007_03_01_1829660	0	Garbled conversations and dropped calls are the bane of cellphone users -- not to mention the dead zones where calls can not go through to begin with .
2007_03_01_1829660	1	But some recent products are designed to overcome these annoyances , improve cellular reception , and , in some cases , even extend coverage .
2007_03_01_1829660	2	The simplest and least expensive option is to use a passive antenna .
2007_03_01_1829660	3	Like the antennas installed in cars at the dawn of the cellphone revolution , these devices work like rabbit ears on a TV or an FM aerial .
2007_03_01_1829660	4	Their increased size and sensitivity make it easier to pick up a signal , improving reception .
2007_03_01_1829660	5	They do not amplify or boost the signal , but they can help connect a call in otherwise difficult areas .
2007_03_01_1829660	6	A portable model from Arc Wireless Solutions , the Freedom Antenna ( $ 34.95 ) , stands a little taller than a deck of cards and about half the thickness .
2007_03_01_1829660	7	It uses a cable to attach to the antenna test port of a cellphone .
2007_03_01_1829660	8	The test port is usually hidden under a tiny round rubber plug that is easily pried off to make the connection .
2007_03_01_1829660	9	In a test on the road , the Freedom Antenna did indeed improve signal strength and the quality of cellular calls , particularly in troublesome areas .
2007_03_01_1829660	10	In spots where I typically receive only two signal bars , the antenna managed to more than double the signal strength .
2007_03_01_1829660	11	And while the unit looked suspiciously like a radar detector on my dashboard , it was worth the aesthetic compromise .
2007_03_01_1829660	12	The Freedom Antenna covers a broad spectrum of signals , from 800 MHz to 2.5 GHz , so it will work with any cellular service in the United States .
2007_03_01_1829660	13	It is also compatible with over 200 models of wireless handsets , although Nokia and BlackBerry owners are out of luck .
2007_03_01_1829660	14	If no signal at all is available , the solution may be a powered signal amplifier .
2007_03_01_1829660	15	Known as repeaters or boosters , such equipment is now available to consumers .
2007_03_01_1829660	16	Basically , these devices use a sensitive antenna that is connected by cable to an amplified base station that must be at least 15 feet away from the antenna .
2007_03_01_1829660	17	The base station in turn uses its own antenna to beam a signal throughout an office or home .
2007_03_01_1829660	18	Professional systems installed by cellular services on large corporate campuses have been used for years to improve coverage , but smaller models for consumers are relatively new .
2007_03_01_1829660	19	The first repeater I tried was the $ 299 Spotwave Z1900 indoor wireless coverage system .
2007_03_01_1829660	20	The Z1900 works only with 1900 MHz wireless services , which include Sprint and T-Mobile and some Cingular coverage areas .
2007_03_01_1829660	21	( Buyers can see if their areas are covered by entering their ZIP codes on Spotwave 's Web site , www.spotwave.com . )
2007_03_01_1829660	22	Setting up the Z1900 is relatively easy .
2007_03_01_1829660	23	The directional antenna box must be pointed toward the source of your cellular signal .
2007_03_01_1829660	24	I found the strongest signal near a front window using my phone ( only two bars ) and then positioned the antenna until its blue light indicated a signal was being received .
2007_03_01_1829660	25	I then situated the indoor coverage unit about 25 feet away from the antenna .
2007_03_01_1829660	26	Initially , the Spotwave delivered solid coverage within the entire room in which it was installed -- a big improvement .
2007_03_01_1829660	27	But when I tried to place a call from my office on the other side of the house , I still could not receive a signal on my Motorola Razr .
2007_03_01_1829660	28	Juggling various test phones , I was able to get reception on a newer Samsung Blackjack smart phone from Cingular , which proved to be more sensitive .
2007_03_01_1829660	29	I was also able to place a call from my office using a T-Mobile BlackBerry Pearl .
2007_03_01_1829660	30	Neither smart phone yielded crystal-clear reception , but it was better than no reception at all .
2007_03_01_1829660	31	For comparison , I tested a repeater from Wi-Ex , the zBoost .
2007_03_01_1829660	32	At $ 399 , it is more expensive than the Spotwave , but because it operates in both the 800 MHz and 1900 MHz bands , the zBoost works with nearly all the major wireless carriers in the United States , including Verizon Wireless , Alltel and Cingular nationwide .
2007_03_01_1829660	33	Like the Spotwave , it will not work with Nextel 's service .
2007_03_01_1829660	34	The zBoost is more industrial in appearance , with a 16-inch-long tube antenna that can be difficult to position .
2007_03_01_1829660	35	Further complicating the installation , the indicator lights are only on the base coverage station .
2007_03_01_1829660	36	That meant I had to run back and forth between the antenna and the base station to find the ideal reception position for the antenna .
2007_03_01_1829660	37	The zBoost performed much like the Spotwave , although I was unable to get the Blackjack to work in my office .
2007_03_01_1829660	38	On the other hand , I had great success with all of the phones in the room in which the repeater was installed , and I was even able to place calls from the basement directly below .
2007_03_01_1829660	39	After I tried both repeater systems , the limitations were apparent .
2007_03_01_1829660	40	Although either can provide coverage for a 2,500-square-foot home , reception areas are significantly reduced if the original signal is weak .
2007_03_01_1829660	41	In my case , with just two bars showing on the phone , the original signal was weak indeed , and the repeaters could extend coverage only over about 200 square feet .
2007_03_01_1829660	42	Furthermore , concrete walls , metal roofs and other construction materials can foil a repeater 's attempts to boost the signal .
2007_03_01_1829660	43	Conferring with wireless carriers during the course of my tests , I also learned that while cellular companies install repeaters in corporate settings to improve service , they are not quite so sanguine about allowing individual consumers to install their own boosters .
2007_03_01_1829660	44	And while the two boosters I tested are approved by the Federal Communications Commission , whether consumers are free to use them wherever they please is a matter of considerable contention .
2007_03_01_1829660	45	While repeaters are not illegal to purchase or own , the fact that they operate in the frequencies licensed by the government to the carriers means that individual users are violating the terms of those licenses when they switch them on .
2007_03_01_1829660	46	According to a representative of Cingular , the company therefore believes that the Federal Communications Act prohibits the unauthorized use of repeaters by consumers .
2007_03_01_1829660	47	And wireless companies assert that the use of unauthorized repeaters can cause interference for other customers .
2007_03_01_1829660	48	Indeed , CTIA -- the Wireless Association , the trade group that represents carriers and manufacturers , asserts that repeaters have sometimes caused temporary service disruptions for adjacent customers .
2007_03_01_1829660	49	Christopher Guttman-McCabe , the CTIA 's vice president for regulatory affairs , says the group believes that '' some discussion with the carrier '' must occur in advance to seek approval of a repeater 's use .
2007_03_01_1829660	50	He warns that without such authorization , a repeater could even endanger lives by disrupting e911 location-based emergency services .
2007_03_01_1829660	51	But none of the carriers offer a standard approval process .
2007_03_01_1829660	52	There appear to be conflicting F.C.C. regulations as to whether cellular subscribers may use cell boosters .
2007_03_01_1829660	53	An F.C.C. spokeswoman said the agency was aware of the issue , but it has not issued an official interpretation of the regulations .
2007_03_01_1829660	54	John Davis , director of product management for Wi-Ex , conceded that oscillation -- a type of interference akin to feedback that can create noise on a carrier 's network -- '' is a valid concern . ''
2007_03_01_1829660	55	But he says the zBoost will automatically shut down if it detects such interference .
2007_03_01_1829660	56	The makers of the Spotwave also say that their device reduces its power in such cases .
2007_03_01_1829660	57	Passive antennas , like the Freedom Antenna , present no such legal or interference concerns .
2007_03_01_1829660	58	And it is extremely unlikely that in my rural test location a properly installed , low-powered repeater could cause interference -- or be detected by the wireless carriers .
2007_03_01_1829660	59	Nevertheless , installing your own repeater is no panacea for poor cellular coverage .
2007_03_01_1829660	60	So like the adage that you need money to make money , it turns out that you also need a signal to improve a signal .
2007_03_01_1829661	0	The Daily Fight Against Spam Q. I made the mistake of filling out a survey online , and ever since I have spent 10 to 15 minutes a day adding addresses to my '' block senders '' list .
2007_03_01_1829661	1	Is there any way I can block all of these at once and report them to some entity ?
2007_03_01_1829661	2	A. Fighting spam can be a daily battle for many people , especially because those who send junk mail are constantly finding new methods of delivering unsolicited messages .
2007_03_01_1829661	3	There are several approaches to cleaning up your mailbox , including buying a third-party spam-filter program , which is often included now in many Internet security software suites .
2007_03_01_1829661	4	Other defenses against in-box invasion include using a mail program with a built-in junk-mail filter or subscribing to a service that culls spam from your legitimate messages .
2007_03_01_1829661	5	Using a spam-screening service may require you to get a new e-mail address -- or ask your correspondents to verify their identities by quickly filling out an online form before their messages can get through -- but this approach can almost eliminate junk mail because any unapproved sender is blocked .
2007_03_01_1829661	6	ChoiceMail ( www.digiportal.com/choicemail.html ) is one company that offers this sort of permission-based e-mail , and there are links and reviews to several similar mail-screening systems at spamlinks.net/filter-cr.htm .
2007_03_01_1829661	7	Using a separate spam filter with or within your mail program can trap a lot of unsolicited messages in a Junk Mail box , but may require some fine-tuning on your part as the program learns what you consider spam .
2007_03_01_1829661	8	These types of spam filters tag suspected junk mail and can usually reroute spam into its own separate mailbox for easy mass deletion .
2007_03_01_1829661	9	If you find a piece of legitimate mail has been caught in the spam filter ( or a piece of junk has wiggled through ) , you typically just have to select the message and tag it yourself as wanted or unwanted so the filter remembers what to do the next time it encounters a similar message .
2007_03_01_1829661	10	As for reporting spam , the Federal Trade Commission has advice for consumers at www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/online/inbox.htm .
2007_03_01_1829661	11	The Hidden Life Of Inactive Icons Q .
2007_03_01_1829661	12	What is Windows XP doing when it offers to hide my '' inactive '' icons ?
2007_03_01_1829661	13	In an attempt to tidy up the notification area on the right side of the Taskbar ( also known as the system tray ) , Windows XP tries to tuck any unused program icons out of sight .
2007_03_01_1829661	14	You can quickly see all your icons by clicking on the arrow on the left side of the notification area .
2007_03_01_1829661	15	If you 'd rather see what 's in the notification area without having to click around , you can change the Taskbar properties .
2007_03_01_1829661	16	Right-click in the notification area and select Properties from the menu .
2007_03_01_1829661	17	Click the Taskbar tab , remove the check in the box next to '' Hide inactive icons , '' and then click Apply and O.K. Burning CDs In iTunes Q. I ca n't burn iTunes Store songs to CD , even though Apple says you can -- I get error messages or the Burn CD button wo n't work .
2007_03_01_1829661	18	How do you make a CD from purchased music ?
2007_03_01_1829661	19	According to Apple , you can burn the same playlist containing tracks purchased from iTunes Store up to seven times to an audio CD .
2007_03_01_1829661	20	You ca n't convert your purchases to other audio formats , so you 'll probably get an error message if you try to burn a playlist with iTunes Store songs to an MP3 CD instead of a regular audio CD .
2007_03_01_1829661	21	The iTunes program lets you record three types of discs : standard audio CD , an MP3 CD and a data CD or DVD .
2007_03_01_1829661	22	Audio CDs are meant to play in most compact disc players , while the MP3 discs play hours of tunes in the MP3 format but need a compatible player .
2007_03_01_1829661	23	The data discs you can record with iTunes are meant for file backup and storage .
2007_03_01_1829661	24	You choose what type of disc to burn in the iTunes preferences area .
2007_03_01_1829661	25	For the Windows version , go to the Edit menu to Preferences ; click on the Advanced tab and then on the Burning tab to select your disc type .
2007_03_01_1829661	26	On the Mac version , go to the iTunes menu to Preferences , and then click on Advanced and Burning .
2007_03_01_1829661	27	If you want to record a disc containing iTunes Store purchases , make sure you select the Audio CD option .
2007_03_01_1829661	28	The songs you want to record also need to be part of a playlist within iTunes .
2007_03_01_1829661	29	( The playlist options are under the program 's File menu . )
2007_03_01_1829661	30	Once you create your playlist , you should be able to click the Burn CD button or choose the '' Burn Playlist to Disc '' option under the program 's File menu .

2007_03_01_1829662	4	The drives , which range from 1 to 4 gigabytes and start around $ 65 , take security seriously .
2007_03_01_1829662	5	They prompt a user periodically for a third password as an extra precaution .
2007_03_01_1829662	6	And after 10 unsuccessful attempts to log on , the drive is locked down .
2007_03_01_1829662	7	Companies can pay extra for a master unlocking program , but for the individual user , the only way to use a drive once it is locked is to reformat it and start over .
2007_03_01_1829662	8	While the drive is meant for business uses , it is available to anyone with data security needs .
2007_03_01_1829662	9	Just do n't forget those passwords .
2007_03_01_1829663	0	The upgraded computer components needed to run Microsoft 's new operating system , Windows Vista , can come at a high price .
2007_03_01_1829663	1	Acer 's TravelMate 2480-2779 laptop , however , costs about $ 550 and runs Vista without complaint .
2007_03_01_1829663	2	The TravelMate has an Intel Celeron M processor running at 1.6 gigahertz , 512 megabytes of RAM and an 80-gigabyte hard drive .
2007_03_01_1829663	3	It comes with Vista Home Basic installed and is available now online and in stores .
2007_03_01_1829663	4	The laptop also has a DVD writer and CD burner along with a 5-in-1 memory card reader .
2007_03_01_1829663	5	It has a 14-inch screen and uses Intel 's graphics chip , the Graphics Media Accelerator 950 .
2007_03_01_1829663	6	Granted , Windows Vista Home Basic , which costs $ 99 by itself , does n't include Microsoft 's flashy new Aero graphical interface .
2007_03_01_1829663	7	This edition does , however , include updated search features and improved security and virus protection .
2007_03_01_1829663	8	Acer 's 2480 line is aimed at the home user who is n't looking for an expensive system but wants all the benefits of Microsoft 's improved operating system -- or at least the basic functions .

2007_03_01_1829664	1	They do not tell you what the terrain is like , or what is beyond the next hill or bend .
2007_03_01_1829664	2	But the DeLorme Earthmate GPS PN-20 knows what is there , displaying topographical maps ( with elevation profiles , campgrounds , trails , streets and highways ) as realistic 3-D flyover simulations , or as bird 's - eye aerial or satellite views showing landmarks .
2007_03_01_1829664	3	DeLorme 's Topo USA 6.0 DVD software , with topological and road maps of the United States and major-highway maps of the world , is included in the PN-20 's $ 370 price .
2007_03_01_1829664	4	Roads can be superimposed on topological maps and aerial imagery downloaded from the Web ; these can be stored in a 75-megabyte internal memory or on optional SD cards .
2007_03_01_1829664	5	The 2.2-inch display can show trip details , compass headings , rising and setting times of the sun and moon , and tide schedules .
2007_03_01_1829664	6	Available at shop.delorme.com , the PN-20 can guide you through street or trail routes , signaling turns with a warning tone , so it can be used on the road as well .
2007_03_01_1829665	0	Converting video for use on an iPod or PlayStation Portable is often time-consuming and complex .
2007_03_01_1829665	1	The iLuv i182 is meant to change that .
2007_03_01_1829665	2	This dock connects to any source with an S-video port and records television ( and other video and audio ) directly to the iPod 's hard drive .
2007_03_01_1829665	3	An attachable SD and MemoryStick card reader can also save video for use in the PSP portable game system or other video players .
2007_03_01_1829665	4	The i182 will be available this month for $ 229 at www.i-luv.com and in stores .
2007_03_01_1829665	5	It records at 640-by-480 pixel resolution for iPods and 720-by-480 pixel resolution for the PSP and other devices .
2007_03_01_1829665	6	The device can be set to stop recording at a preset time , so you can turn it on -- at , say , the beginning of '' Lost '' -- and let it record for later consumption .
2007_03_01_1829665	7	The recordings are encoded specifically for each playback device and are immediately available once recording is complete .
2007_03_01_1829665	8	Unfortunately , you still need to initiate the recording manually , so the iLuv i182 is n't a replacement for a TiVo .
2007_03_01_1829666	0	Put a rock band in your mouth , along with a dab of toothpaste , with Tooth Tunes , a $ 10 musical toothbrush from Tiger Electronics , a division of Hasbro .
2007_03_01_1829666	1	The theory is that two minutes of brushing is needed to give teeth a proper cleaning .
2007_03_01_1829666	2	So the brush is really a kind of timer .
2007_03_01_1829666	3	The feeling is a bit eerie .
2007_03_01_1829666	4	The sound is transferred through the brush tip , into the teeth , and right into the inner ear , so you feel the music .
2007_03_01_1829666	5	Because volume is related to pressure , you can turn up the volume by applying steady pressure to your teeth .
2007_03_01_1829666	6	Unfortunately , you can also hear better when not brushing , which children can soon learn .
2007_03_01_1829666	7	The brushes , first released last fall , are being sold nationwide this month in stores or at www.toothtunes.com .
2007_03_01_1829666	8	They feature 17 artists , including the Black Eyed Peas , Hilary Duff , Kiss and others .
2007_03_01_1829666	9	There is even one that plays '' Y.M.C.A. , '' so theoretically you can have the Village People in your head .
2007_03_01_1829666	10	The switch is slime-proof , and batteries are included , providing power for up to six months .
2007_03_01_1829666	11	When they run out , you throw the brush away -- and , Hasbro hopes , buy a new tune .
2007_03_01_1829666	12	Now you can tell your child to '' keep brushing until Queen has finished , honey . ''
2007_03_01_1829667	0	All the presidential candidates this year will talk about education .
2007_03_01_1829667	1	The conventional ones will talk about improving the schools .
2007_03_01_1829667	2	The creative ones will talk about improving the lives of students .
2007_03_01_1829667	3	The conventional ones , though they do n't know it , are prisoners of the dead husk of behaviorism .
2007_03_01_1829667	4	They will speak of education as if children were blank slates waiting to have ideas inputted into their brains with some efficient delivery mechanism .
2007_03_01_1829667	5	The creative ones will finally absorb the truth found in decades of research : the relationships children have outside school shape their performance inside the school .
2007_03_01_1829667	6	The conventional candidates will give the same old education reform speeches , trumpeting this or that bureaucratic reshuffle .
2007_03_01_1829667	7	The creative ones will give speeches like the one David Cameron , who is reviving the British Tory party , gave last month .
2007_03_01_1829667	8	They will talk , as Cameron did , about the mushy things , like love and attachment , and will say , as Cameron did , '' Family relationships matter more than anything else . ''
2007_03_01_1829667	9	They will understand that schools filled with students who ca n't control their impulses , who ca n't focus their attention and who ca n't regulate their emotions will not succeed , no matter how many reforms are made by governors , superintendents or presidents .
2007_03_01_1829667	10	These candidates will emphasize that education is a cumulative process that begins at the dawn of life and builds early in life as children learn how to learn .
2007_03_01_1829667	11	These candidates will point out that powerful social trends -- the doubling of single-parent families over the past generation , the rise of divorce rates -- mean that government has to rethink its role .
2007_03_01_1829667	12	They 'll note that if we want to have successful human capital policies , we have to get over the definition of education as something that takes place in schools between the hours of 8 and 3 , between the months of September and June , and between the ages of 5 and 18 .
2007_03_01_1829667	13	As Bob Marvin of the University of Virginia points out , there is a mountain of evidence demonstrating that early childhood attachments shape lifelong learning competence .
2007_03_01_1829667	14	Children do have inborn temperaments and intelligence .
2007_03_01_1829667	15	Nevertheless , students make the most of their natural dispositions when they have a secure emotional base from which to explore , and even the brightest children stumble when there is chaos inside .
2007_03_01_1829667	16	Research over the past few decades impressively shows that children who emerge from attentive , attuned parental relationships do better in school and beyond .
2007_03_01_1829667	17	They tend to choose friends wisely .
2007_03_01_1829667	18	They handle frustration better .
2007_03_01_1829667	19	They 're more resilient in the face of setbacks .
2007_03_01_1829667	20	They grow up to become more productive workers .
2007_03_01_1829667	21	On the other hand , as Martha Farah of the University of Pennsylvania has found , students who do not feel emotionally safe tend not to develop good memories ( which is consistent with cortisol experiments in animals ) .
2007_03_01_1829667	22	Students from less stimulating environments have worse language skills .
2007_03_01_1829667	23	The question , of course , is , What can government do about any of this ?
2007_03_01_1829667	24	The answer is that there are programs that do work to help young and stressed mothers establish healthier attachments .
2007_03_01_1829667	25	These programs usually involve having nurses or mature women make a series of home visits to give young mothers the sort of cajoling and practical wisdom that in other times would have been delivered by grandmothers or elders .
2007_03_01_1829667	26	The Circle of Security program has measurably improved attachments and enhanced social skills .
2007_03_01_1829667	27	The Nurse-Family Partnerships program , founded by David Olds , has produced rigorously examined , impressive results .
2007_03_01_1829667	28	Children who have been in this program had 59 percent fewer arrests at age 15 .
2007_03_01_1829667	29	( Presidential candidates are commanded to read Katherine Boo 's Feb. 6 , 2006 , New Yorker article to get a feel for how these programs work . )
2007_03_01_1829667	30	It 's important not to get carried away . ''
2007_03_01_1829667	31	Enhancing Early Attachments , '' a review of the literature edited by Lisa Berlin and others , is filled with phrases like '' marginal success '' and '' modest but significant benefits . ''
2007_03_01_1829667	32	But these programs can be expanded .
2007_03_01_1829667	33	And one thing is clear : It 's crazy to have educational policies that , in effect , chop up children 's brains into the rational cortex , which the government ministers to in schools , and the emotional limbic system , which the government ignores .
2007_03_01_1829667	34	In nature there is no neat division .
2007_03_01_1829667	35	Emotional engagement is the essence of information processing and learning .
2007_03_01_1829667	36	In Britain , where both David Cameron and Gordon Brown have grappled with this reality , policy is catching up with the research .
2007_03_01_1829667	37	In the United States , we are forever behind .
2007_03_01_1829667	38	But that wo n't last .
2007_03_01_1829667	39	This year , some smart presidential candidate will help us catch up .
2007_03_01_1829668	0	AS the presidential primary campaigns begin in earnest , the Iraq war is overshadowing all other issues , as it did during the midterm elections .
2007_03_01_1829668	1	Presidential candidates who were in the Senate in October 2002 are particularly under the microscope , as they are being called upon to justify their votes for going to war .
2007_03_01_1829668	2	As someone who was in the Senate at the time , I have been struck by the contours of the debate .
2007_03_01_1829668	3	The situation facing the candidates who cast war votes has , to my surprise , often been presented as a binary one -- they could either vote for the war , or not .
2007_03_01_1829668	4	There was no middle ground .
2007_03_01_1829668	5	There was indeed a third way , which Senator James Jeffords , independent of Vermont , hailed at the time as '' one of the most important votes we will cast in this process . ''
2007_03_01_1829668	6	And it was opposed by every single senator at the time who now seeks higher office .
2007_03_01_1829668	7	A mere 10 hours before the roll was called on the administration-backed Iraq war resolution , the Senate had an opportunity to prevent the current catastrophe in Iraq and to salvage the United States ' international standing .
2007_03_01_1829668	8	Carl Levin , Democrat of Michigan , offered a substitute to the war resolution , the Multilateral Use of Force Authorization Act of 2002 .
2007_03_01_1829668	9	Senator Levin 's amendment called for United Nations approval before force could be authorized .
2007_03_01_1829668	10	It was unambiguous and compatible with international law .
2007_03_01_1829668	11	Acutely cognizant of the dangers of the time , and the reality that diplomatic options could at some point be exhausted , Senator Levin wrote an amendment that was nimble : it affirmed that Congress would stand at the ready to reconsider the use of force if , in the judgment of the president , a United Nations resolution was not '' promptly adopted '' or enforced .
2007_03_01_1829668	12	Ceding no rights or sovereignty to an international body , the amendment explicitly avowed America 's right to defend itself if threatened .
2007_03_01_1829668	13	An opponent of the Levin amendment said that the debate was not over objectives , but tactics .
2007_03_01_1829668	14	And he was right .
2007_03_01_1829668	15	To a senator , we all had as our objectives the safety of American citizens , the security of our country and the disarming of Saddam Hussein in compliance with United Nations resolutions .
2007_03_01_1829668	16	But there was a steadfast core of us who believed that the tactics should be diplomacy and multilateralism , not the '' go it alone '' approach of the Bush doctrine .
2007_03_01_1829668	17	Those of us who supported the Levin amendment argued against a rush to war .
2007_03_01_1829668	18	We asserted that the Iraqi regime , though undeniably heinous , did not constitute an imminent threat to United States security , and that our campaign to renew weapons inspections in Iraq -- whether by force or diplomacy -- would succeed only if we enlisted a broad coalition that included Arab states .
2007_03_01_1829668	19	We also urged our colleagues to take seriously the admonitions of our allies in the region -- Egypt , Jordan , Kuwait , Pakistan , Saudi Arabia and Turkey .
2007_03_01_1829668	20	As King Abdullah of Jordan warned , '' A miscalculation in Iraq would throw the whole area into turmoil . ''
2007_03_01_1829668	21	Unfortunately , these arguments fell on deaf ears in that emotionally charged , hawkish , post-9 / 11 moment , less than four weeks before a midterm election .
2007_03_01_1829668	22	The Levin amendment was defeated by a 75 to 24 vote .
2007_03_01_1829668	23	Later that night , the Iraq War Resolution was approved , 77 to 23 .
2007_03_01_1829668	24	It was clear that most senators were immune to persuasion because the two votes were almost mirror images of each other -- no to the Levin amendment , aye to war .
2007_03_01_1829668	25	Their minds were made up .
2007_03_01_1829668	26	It was incomprehensible to me at the time that the Levin amendment received only 24 votes .
2007_03_01_1829668	27	However , there were some heroes , like Paul Wellstone , Democrat of Minnesota , who even in the midst of a very difficult re-election campaign voted to slow the march to war .
2007_03_01_1829668	28	And then there was the moving statement by Robert Byrd , Democrat of West Virginia , in support of the Levin amendment and against the administration-backed resolution : '' This is an unprecedented and unfounded interpretation of the president 's authority under the Constitution of the United States -- not to mention the fact that it stands the charter of the United Nations on its head . ''
2007_03_01_1829668	29	Americans are gravely concerned about Iraq , and yearn for leadership to stabilize the situation there and gradually end United States involvement .
2007_03_01_1829668	30	Calling on presidential hopefuls to justify or recant their vote authorizing the president to take us to war almost misses the point .
2007_03_01_1829668	31	The Senate had the opportunity to support a more deliberate , multilateral approach , one that still would have empowered the United States to respond to any imminent threat posed by Saddam Hussein .
2007_03_01_1829668	32	We must not sidestep the fact that a sensible alternative did exist , but it was rejected .
2007_03_01_1829668	33	Candidates -- Democrat and Republican -- should be called to account for their vote on the Levin amendment .
2007_03_01_1829668	34	Op-Ed Contributor Lincoln D. Chafee , a Republican senator from Rhode Island from 1999 to 2006 , is a visiting fellow at the Watson Institute for International Studies at Brown University .
2007_03_01_1829670	0	The Rev. Al Sharpton seemed subdued , quiet , reflective -- which was unusual .
2007_03_01_1829670	1	Just when we thought the news could n't get any weirder , we learned this week , via The Daily News , that Mr. Sharpton 's great-grandfather was a slave who was owned by relatives of Senator Strom Thurmond , the longtime archsegregationist who ran for president as a Dixiecrat in 1948 . ''
2007_03_01_1829670	2	There 's not enough troops in the Army , '' Mr. Thurmond told a screaming crowd during that campaign , '' to force the Southern people to break down segregation and admit the nigra race into our theaters , into our swimming pools , into our schools and into our homes . ''
2007_03_01_1829670	3	Mr. Sharpton seemed a little shaken by the revelation . ''
2007_03_01_1829670	4	You 're always kind of thinking that your ancestors were slaves , '' he said . ''
2007_03_01_1829670	5	But this was my grandfather 's father .
2007_03_01_1829670	6	I knew my grandfather .
2007_03_01_1829670	7	It 's eerie when it becomes so personal . ''
2007_03_01_1829670	8	The days of slavery are closer than we tend to think , and they were crueler than we tend to realize .
2007_03_01_1829670	9	Mr. Sharpton 's great-grandfather , Coleman Sharpton , was sent with his wife and two children from South Carolina to Florida so a woman named Julia Thurmond Sharpton could send them out as laborers to pay off debts left by her late husband .
2007_03_01_1829670	10	Julia Sharpton was a first cousin , twice removed , of Strom Thurmond . ''
2007_03_01_1829670	11	They were sent there solely for that reason , '' Mr. Sharpton said . ''
2007_03_01_1829670	12	To make money to pay her debt .
2007_03_01_1829670	13	It was just so clear that they were nothing but property .
2007_03_01_1829670	14	The complete dehumanization -- I do n't think I fully understood it until this hit home . ''
2007_03_01_1829670	15	There 's a great deal that Americans do n't fully understand about slavery .
2007_03_01_1829670	16	It 's such an uncomfortable subject that the temptation is to relegate it to the distant past and move on .
2007_03_01_1829670	17	But the long tentacles of that evil institution are still with us .
2007_03_01_1829670	18	Slavery was the foundation of the thriving consumer society that we have today and the wellspring of the racism that still poisons so many white attitudes and black lives .
2007_03_01_1829670	19	The sheer size of the phenomenon of slavery , which was woven into the very being of the early Americas , is not well known today .
2007_03_01_1829670	20	The historian David Brion Davis , in his book '' Inhuman Bondage , '' tells us : '' By 1820 nearly 8.7 million slaves had departed from Africa for the New World , as opposed to only 2.6 million whites , many of them convicts or indentured servants , who had left Europe .
2007_03_01_1829670	21	Thus by 1820 African slaves constituted almost 77 percent of the enormous population that had sailed toward the Americas , and from 1760 to 1820 this emigrating flow included 5.6 African slaves for every European . ''
2007_03_01_1829670	22	For most of the time between the Revolutionary War and the Civil War , the United States was governed by presidents who owned slaves .
2007_03_01_1829670	23	One of the points Mr. Davis stressed was that the commodities produced in such tremendous volume by slaves -- sugar , tobacco , coffee , chocolate , cotton -- were crucial to the formation of the world 's first global mass market . ''
2007_03_01_1829670	24	From the very beginnings , '' wrote Mr. Davis , '' America was part black , and indebted to the appalling sacrifices of millions of individual blacks who cleared the forests and tilled the soil .
2007_03_01_1829670	25	Yet even the ardent opponents of slaveholding could seldom if ever acknowledge this basic fact . ''
2007_03_01_1829670	26	Instead of reaping rewards for this seminal role in the creation of a rich and powerful nation , blacks have been relentlessly vilified by a profoundly racist society and frozen out of most of the nation 's bounty .
2007_03_01_1829670	27	Consigned to the bottom of the caste heap after emancipation , and denied some of the most basic human rights , blacks became the convenient depository of whatever blame and negative stereotypes whites chose to cast their way .
2007_03_01_1829670	28	The abject state ruthlessly imposed upon blacks for so long became , perversely , proof of their inferiority .
2007_03_01_1829670	29	Blacks gave whites of all classes someone to look down upon .
2007_03_01_1829670	30	Slavery , like the past , as Faulkner reminded us , is not dead .
2007_03_01_1829670	31	It 's not even past .
2007_03_01_1829670	32	It 's not something that you can wish away .
2007_03_01_1829670	33	The other night Reverend Sharpton flew into Miami to attend a conference .
2007_03_01_1829670	34	At the airport someone asked for his autograph . ''
2007_03_01_1829670	35	It was the first time in my life that I thought about why my name is Sharpton , '' he said . ''
2007_03_01_1829670	36	I mean this whole thing is as personal as why your name is what it is .
2007_03_01_1829670	37	You 're named after someone who owned your great-grandparents . ''
2007_03_01_1829671	0	THE decision of the global Anglican Communion to threaten the Episcopal Church , its American affiliate , with expulsion is about much more than the headline issue of homosexuality .
2007_03_01_1829671	1	Yes , the impending divorce has been precipitated by the decision of the Episcopal Church to consecrate a gay bishop and to allow individual congregations to decide whether or not to allow gay marriages .
2007_03_01_1829671	2	But as so often in religious history , the deeper issue is one of church governance .
2007_03_01_1829671	3	In effect , the Episcopalians left the Church of England more than two centuries ago .
2007_03_01_1829671	4	The problem dates back to the time of the American Revolution , when the Church of England in America was just what that name says : it was the Church of England , merely in America .
2007_03_01_1829671	5	Since the 16th century , when King Henry VIII made himself , in effect , the pope of England , the English king had been the supreme church authority .
2007_03_01_1829671	6	Time had somewhat eroded this authority by 1776 , thanks in part to the Puritan revolution in the mid-17th century .
2007_03_01_1829671	7	Nonetheless , the authority structure within the church remained officially monarchical .
2007_03_01_1829671	8	So it was no surprise that after the newborn United States broke with the crown in the political realm , the Church of England in the United States did so in the religious realm as well , establishing a democratic form of self-governance under a '' presiding bishop , '' whose title echoed that of the chief executive of the new nation .
2007_03_01_1829671	9	The name the new church adopted -- from episkopos , the ancient Greek word for bishop -- signaled that its governance would be neither by pope nor by king but , as in early Christianity , by elected bishops .
2007_03_01_1829671	10	British colonial history did not end in 1776 , of course .
2007_03_01_1829671	11	As the British Empire grew , the Church of England went wherever the crown went , evolving in the process into a religious multinational , called the Anglican Communion , in which the Archbishop of Canterbury exercised a global spiritual jurisdiction .
2007_03_01_1829671	12	Structurally , however , the Episcopal Church , though long since reconciled with Britain , remained uneasy under this arrangement .
2007_03_01_1829671	13	Because the deepest rationale for the creation of the Church of England had been that church governance through separate national churches better reflected the practice of the early church than did papal governance .
2007_03_01_1829671	14	During its first centuries , Christianity had governed itself as separate but equal dioceses or administrative units , each coinciding with a great capital city , each headed by a bishop ; the pope , at that time , was merely the bishop of Rome .
2007_03_01_1829671	15	Thus , the same logic that dictated the initial creation of the Church of England dictated that , once the United States had become a separate nation , it ought not to belong any longer to the Church of England nor to the Anglican Communion as a colonial extension .
2007_03_01_1829671	16	For sentimental reasons , including now fading American Anglophilia , Episcopalians and Anglicans alike tended to mute this logic .
2007_03_01_1829671	17	However , under the improbable stimulus of a dispute over homosexuals , the logic may be about to assert itself , with consequences that may be larger for the Anglican Communion , and in particular for the Archbishop of Canterbury , than for the Episcopal Church itself .
2007_03_01_1829671	18	Numerically , the 2.3 million Episcopalians do not loom large among 77 million Anglicans .
2007_03_01_1829671	19	Symbolically , however , given the global importance of the United States , the departure of the Americans will leave the archbishop exposed as a quasi-colonial , quasi-papal figurehead heading a church made up , anachronistically , of Britain and her mostly African and Asian former colonies .
2007_03_01_1829671	20	This will be an awkward state of affairs , and portends further fissures along the same logic that underlies the impending departure of the Americans .
2007_03_01_1829671	21	There is , finally , a quintessentially 21st-century implication to this quite likely split .
2007_03_01_1829671	22	A solid majority of American Episcopalians supports their church 's stance on homosexuality and gay marriage .
2007_03_01_1829671	23	A minority disagrees , and some of these members have even sought to pull out their congregations from the Episcopal Church and affiliate with one of the Anglican churches in Africa that have been most vehemently opposed to the Episcopalians ' decisions on homosexuality .
2007_03_01_1829671	24	The flip side of such threats is that , along the same lines , any British or Canadian or Australian congregations that wished to disaffiliate from their local forms of Anglicanism might well affiliate with the Episcopal Church .
2007_03_01_1829671	25	In fact , a few have already signaled their readiness , though in the hope of preserving Anglican unity the Episcopal Church has not encouraged them .
2007_03_01_1829671	26	I pass over , for the moment , the many legal complications involved in such rearrangements , the surrendering of church property that is entailed and so forth .
2007_03_01_1829671	27	The broader point is that communications technology makes new forms of church organization possible , and geographically distant congregations can easily join together .
2007_03_01_1829671	28	Rather than voting with your feet , you may now vote with your mouse , perhaps the most amicable form of religious divorce .
2007_03_01_1829671	29	A generation from now , when we look back on the breakup of the Anglican Communion and on the status of homosexuals within the churches of the world , what may we expect to see ?
2007_03_01_1829671	30	An old proverb holds that '' God writes straight with crooked lines , '' and at this juncture , the Author of Liberty , as a venerable American hymn names him , seems to have taken pen in hand .

2007_03_01_1829672	0	Ali Mezar has spent his life fishing a narrow , muddy patch of the Nile in this , one of the most crowded cities in the world .
2007_03_01_1829672	1	But Mr. Mezar has little contact with urban civilization .
2007_03_01_1829672	2	He sleeps in his boat , makes tea from the dirty Nile water and on good days earns a few dollars .
2007_03_01_1829672	3	Not far away , on the shoulder of a busy avenue , Karim Sayed , 21 , herds sheep and goats matted with urban filth .
2007_03_01_1829672	4	He spends his days staring into oncoming traffic , hoping to make a sale before the police move him or confiscate a sheep .
2007_03_01_1829672	5	At the city 's edge , in a packed neighborhood built entirely by its residents , Mina Fathy and his neighbors fix sewerage , water and electricity problems on their own because they say the government offers them virtually no service in such functions .
2007_03_01_1829672	6	Cairo is home to 15 million and often described as the center of the Arab world , an incubator of culture and ideas .
2007_03_01_1829672	7	But it is also a collection of villages , a ruralized metropolis where people live by their wits and devices , cut off from the authorities , the law and often each other .
2007_03_01_1829672	8	That social reality does not just speak to the quality and style of life for millions of Egyptians .
2007_03_01_1829672	9	It also plays a role in the nation 's style of governance .
2007_03_01_1829672	10	The fisherman on the Nile , the shepherd in the road and residents of so-called informal communities say their experiences navigating city life have taught them the same lessons : the government is not there to better their lives ; advancement is based on connections and bribes ; the central authority is at best a benign force to be avoided . ''
2007_03_01_1829672	11	Everything is from God , '' said Mr. Mezar , the fisherman , who was speaking practically , not theologically . ''
2007_03_01_1829672	12	There is no such thing as government .
2007_03_01_1829672	13	The government is one thing , and we are something else .
2007_03_01_1829672	14	What am I going to get from the government ? ''
2007_03_01_1829672	15	Cairo has been the capital of Egypt for more than 1,000 years , and sits where the dry sands of the desert lead to the fertile Nile Delta .
2007_03_01_1829672	16	Egyptian officials like to say that this is where modern bureaucracy was invented , where the mechanics of governance first took shape .
2007_03_01_1829672	17	While the Egyptian government is the country 's largest employer , it is by all accounts an utterly unreliable source of help for the average citizen .
2007_03_01_1829672	18	That combination , social scientists say , helps create a system that has stifled political opposition and allowed a small group to remain in power for decades .
2007_03_01_1829672	19	One brick in the foundation of single-party rule has been public resignation .
2007_03_01_1829672	20	There is no widespread expectation that the authorities will give the common man a voice , and so there is rarely any outrage when they do not .
2007_03_01_1829672	21	The fisherman , the shepherd and Mr. Fathy all said that the most they could hope for from the government was that it stay out of their lives . ''
2007_03_01_1829672	22	We hope God keeps the municipality away from us , '' Mr. Sayed said as he sat in a wooden chair , surveying his fetid flock of goats and sheep with headlights streaming by .
2007_03_01_1829672	23	Such a feeling of separation is one reason that the leadership has been able to clamp down on opposition political activities without incurring widespread public wrath , political analysts say . ''
2007_03_01_1829672	24	People see the government as something quite foreign or removed from their lives , '' said Diane Singerman , a professor in government at American University in Washington who has written extensively about Cairo . ''
2007_03_01_1829672	25	Commuters to the city , or poor peddlers and working people , do not see the government as particularly interested in their lives , and they also see politics as quite elite and risky and something to stay away from . ''
2007_03_01_1829672	26	Officials say part of the disillusionment comes from unrealistic expectations , a holdover from the heady days of Gamal Abdel Nasser , Egypt 's leader from 1954 to 1970 , when government jobs were deemed a right and cradle-to-grave care a promise .
2007_03_01_1829672	27	Mr. Mezar and his cousin Muhammad Hassan fish the Nile just as their parents and their grandparents did , living in the bottom of their small wooden boats .
2007_03_01_1829672	28	Dark from the sun , hands callused from their oars , they are the image of Egypt , and they often smile and wave dutifully as tour boats motor up the river , with tourists snapping their pictures .
2007_03_01_1829672	29	They dock their boats beneath a busy overpass , waking each morning at 6 , filling their glasses with tea made from water scooped directly from the Nile .
2007_03_01_1829672	30	They worry that despite their fishing licenses , the police will demand their fish or write a ticket for some invented infraction . ''
2007_03_01_1829672	31	There is only despair , '' Mr. Hassan said as he slowly rowed while his son , Rageb , 22 , stood barefoot on the front of the boat putting out the net . ''
2007_03_01_1829672	32	It is all about connections .
2007_03_01_1829672	33	If you know someone , you get 20 jobs .
2007_03_01_1829672	34	If not , you get nothing . ''
2007_03_01_1829672	35	He said they knew about bilharzia , the life-threatening parasite in the slow-moving waters on the edge of the Nile , but their priority is catching fish . ''
2007_03_01_1829672	36	We get checked for bilharzia , '' he said . ''
2007_03_01_1829672	37	he was asked . ''
2007_03_01_1829672	38	No , never , '' he replied , shaking his head .
2007_03_01_1829672	39	There were four boats working the river one morning , including Mr. Hassan 's .
2007_03_01_1829672	40	The crews were all relatives of his .
2007_03_01_1829672	41	No one expressed anger -- or depression .
2007_03_01_1829672	42	I am sick of Egypt , '' Mr. Mezar said . ''
2007_03_01_1829672	43	I like fishing , but you see , are there any fish ?
2007_03_01_1829672	44	I would give all of this if the government gave me a job . ''
2007_03_01_1829672	45	Cairo has grown like a living organism , swallowing up agricultural lands and villages as its population has ballooned .
2007_03_01_1829672	46	Nearly three-quarters of the population live like Mr. Fathy , in informal communities .
2007_03_01_1829672	47	Mr. Fathy comes from Manshiet Nasser , a sprawling labyrinth of brick apartment buildings along trash-strewn dirt roads that is home to hundreds of thousands of people .
2007_03_01_1829672	48	Informal communities are not shantytowns , but neighborhoods that grew organically , without any urban planning .
2007_03_01_1829672	49	People simply built homes , some buying agricultural land , some squatting on desert land .
2007_03_01_1829672	50	The nature of these communities has bred a sense of distance and alienation from the government , experts in Cairo 's life say .
2007_03_01_1829672	51	The government only provided services when the neighborhoods reached a critical mass , when the numbers of people could no longer be ignored .
2007_03_01_1829672	52	Roads are so narrow that police trucks can not enter .
2007_03_01_1829672	53	Order is established by the community , independent from the authorities . ''
2007_03_01_1829672	54	My impression is that they think they are something different from the rest of the city , '' said Abdel Halim Ibrahim Abdel Halim , an urban planner and architect . ''
2007_03_01_1829672	55	They feel like they provided housing for themselves , they control that housing . ''
2007_03_01_1829672	56	Residents of Manshiet Nasser , which is on a plateau , often refer to those in the formal center of the city as '' people who come from under , '' as Salah Ibrahim , 40 , meant when he said , '' People who come from under never listen to us . ''
2007_03_01_1829672	57	He said a road in front of his house had been flooded with sewage for days until , finally , the neighbors all donated money to have it repaired . ''
2007_03_01_1829672	58	Every house is on its own , '' said Mr. Fathy , who said he had paid a bribe of 2,000 pounds , about $ 350 , when inspectors insisted that he tear down the third-floor apartment he was building on top of his parents ' building . ''
2007_03_01_1829672	59	Every house has to solve its own problems . ''
2007_03_01_1829674	0	Facing skeptical lawmakers , Mel Karmazin , the architect of a proposed merger of the nation 's two satellite radio companies , announced at a hearing in Congress on Wednesday that the companies would agree to government-imposed price controls and other unspecified measures to gain regulatory approval for the deal .
2007_03_01_1829674	1	Appearing before an antitrust task force of the House Judiciary Committee , Mr. Karmazin , the chief executive of Sirius Satellite Radio , repeatedly and angrily contested charges by opponents , including the major trade group for broadcasters , that merging his company with XM Satellite Radio Holdings would simply transform a duopoly into a monopoly . ''
2007_03_01_1829674	2	There is no monopoly or duopoly , '' he said . ''
2007_03_01_1829674	3	That 's the most bizarre thing I have ever heard . ''
2007_03_01_1829674	4	He maintained that the relevant market for the services offered by the two satellite radio companies includes all terrestrial broadcasters , Internet radio and other popular listening devices , including iPods and other portable music players .
2007_03_01_1829674	5	With so much competition from other sources , he said , satellite radio lacks the sway of a dominant industry power .
2007_03_01_1829674	6	But as he tried to sell the proposed deal to Washington , he also acknowledged the major challenges he faced in persuading policy makers that it would not be anticompetitive .
2007_03_01_1829674	7	He made it clear that he was willing to embark on the same kind of deal - making with the regulators that has been a hallmark of his career as a broadcast executive . ''
2007_03_01_1829674	8	We 're prepared to make concessions , and we 're willing to work with the F.C.C. on doing it , '' he said , speaking about the discussions the two companies will have with regulators at the Justice Department 's antitrust division and the Federal Communications Commission .
2007_03_01_1829674	9	When a Republican lawmaker , Representative Ric Keller of Florida , pressed Mr. Karmazin over whether the company would agree to price controls , Mr. Karmazin said yes , adding , '' We believe we need to show you this is in the public interest and price is important . '' ''
2007_03_01_1829674	10	We should be held accountable for everything we say , '' he told another Republican lawmaker , Representative J. Randy Forbes of Virginia , in response to a question about how to enforce the commitments Mr. Karmazin was making for more programming and better services at lower prices . ''
2007_03_01_1829674	11	I 'll leave it to the regulators , '' he added . ''
2007_03_01_1829674	12	This is n't about ` Trust me . '
2007_03_01_1829674	13	We should be able to be accountable . ''
2007_03_01_1829674	14	But toward the end of the hearing , when a Democratic lawmaker , Representative Sheila Jackson-Lee of Texas , complained that there was too much concentration in the broadcasting industry and a lack of adequate diversity in both programming and ownership , Mr. Karmazin appeared to hedge about making any further commitments . ''
2007_03_01_1829674	15	I do n't want to make promises to suggest I 'll do anything to get the merger done , '' he said . ''
2007_03_01_1829674	16	You can be damned if you do , and damned if you do n't . ''
2007_03_01_1829674	17	The specific commitments that Mr. Karmazin sought to make did not assuage some of the proposed merger 's more vociferous critics .
2007_03_01_1829674	18	Representative F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. , the Wisconsin Republican who until this year had headed the Judiciary Committee , said Mr. Karmazin 's proposal reminded him of '' an old regulated gas company '' or some other highly regulated utility with rates set by the government . ''
2007_03_01_1829674	19	I do n't think that 's the policy we want to promote , '' Mr. Sensenbrenner said . ''
2007_03_01_1829674	20	What you said is so far from the truth , '' Mr. Karmazin replied . ''
2007_03_01_1829674	21	But you are a monopoly , '' Mr. Sensenbrenner said . ''
2007_03_01_1829674	22	We are absolutely not a monopoly , '' Mr. Karmazin responded .
2007_03_01_1829674	23	The generally hostile reception to Mr. Karmazin reflected the fact that the political forces all seem to be leaning in one direction regarding the proposed merger .
2007_03_01_1829674	24	A powerful alliance of broadcasters and consumer groups has challenged the deal as a violation of antitrust laws and contrary to the '' public interest '' standards applied by regulators when they consider whether to approve radio mergers .
2007_03_01_1829674	25	The National Association of Broadcasters , with powerful members in every Congressional district , has waged a political and public relations campaign attacking the deal .
2007_03_01_1829674	26	By contrast , the two satellite networks have no significant industry allies on their side .
2007_03_01_1829674	27	They were warmly embraced at the hearing by only one Democratic lawmaker , Representative Anthony Weiner of New York .
2007_03_01_1829674	28	Sirius and XM point to the opposition from broadcasters as proof that the deal would make satellite radio still more competitive with the rest of the radio industry .
2007_03_01_1829674	29	The unanswered question after the hearing is what resonance the Congressional reaction would have with lawyers at the Justice Department and policy makers at the F.C.C. Government officials are not expected to reach their conclusions about the deal for many months , although Kevin J. Martin , the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission , has expressed skepticism .
2007_03_01_1829674	30	A commission rule forbidding the merger of the satellite companies would have to be waived for the deal to be completed .
2007_03_01_1829674	31	At the Justice Department , XM and Sirius have more reason to be optimistic , in large part because the Bush administration has been more permissive on antitrust issues than any administration in modern times .
2007_03_01_1829674	32	The consumer groups and broadcasters -- political opponents on other issues -- have struck a fragile alliance as they have gone about challenging the satellite radio deal .
2007_03_01_1829674	33	On Wednesday , one consumer group , Public Knowledge , called for the regulators to heavily condition the deal with price controls and free airwaves for alternative voices before approving it .
2007_03_01_1829674	34	The group also said that broadcasters opposing the deal on antitrust grounds were hypocritical because they were simultaneously trying to ease rules that have prevented more consolidation in their industry .
2007_03_01_1829675	0	For voyeurs of billionaires , a brief period from mid-February to mid-March serves up two of the juiciest glimpses they will get all year .
2007_03_01_1829675	1	In February , the Slate 60 list of the year 's biggest philanthropic gifts comes out , followed in March by the Forbes magazine list of the world 's richest people .
2007_03_01_1829675	2	This time , one name -- Warren E. Buffett -- will appear conspicuously on both .
2007_03_01_1829675	3	His fortune will probably rank second in the world behind only Bill Gates 's , as it has for some years .
2007_03_01_1829675	4	In philanthropy , however , Mr. Buffett is No. 1 by a wide margin .
2007_03_01_1829675	5	Last year , he shook the world of billionaires by pledging more than $ 42 billion for charity -- by far the largest philanthropic donation in history and close to the total of all the Slate 60 donations for the last six years combined .
2007_03_01_1829675	6	You could almost see the editors at Forbes airbrushing the perplexed and stricken looks off the faces of their other billionaires .
2007_03_01_1829675	7	He 's giving away $ 42 billion ?
2007_03_01_1829675	8	Certainly that is not what most of them had in mind for their fortunes .
2007_03_01_1829675	9	But the move by Mr. Buffett raises the question of exactly what the other billionaires do have in mind for their money .
2007_03_01_1829675	10	According to the economist Christopher Carroll at Johns Hopkins University , in his article '' Why Do the Rich Save So Much ?
2007_03_01_1829675	11	, '' the seemingly obvious question of why people would want so much money turns out to be a real puzzle .
2007_03_01_1829675	12	The rational economic argument for accumulating wealth says that people want to use it for something : to spend , to give to their families to enhance their future standard of living or to do something philanthropic .
2007_03_01_1829675	13	When you look at the Slate 60 list , however , you see that philanthropy ca n't be the main reason .
2007_03_01_1829675	14	For all of their amazing generosity , the super-rich typically do not give away their entire fortunes , or even a big share .
2007_03_01_1829675	15	That 's what makes Mr. Buffett so notable .
2007_03_01_1829675	16	For 2006 , the Slate 60 not including Mr. Buffett pledged or gave a little over $ 7 billion to charity .
2007_03_01_1829675	17	Yet as of September 2006 , the 60 richest Americans had an estimated $ 630 billion of wealth , up more than $ 62 billion ( about 10 percent ) from the year before .
2007_03_01_1829675	18	People are accumulating money much faster than they are giving it away .
2007_03_01_1829675	19	Professor Carroll says the super-rich ca n't be accumulating the money with the intention of spending it , either , because no one could spend that much .
2007_03_01_1829675	20	To see his point , take Oracle 's founder , Lawrence J. Ellison .
2007_03_01_1829675	21	Mr. Ellison 's net worth last year was around $ 16 billion .
2007_03_01_1829675	22	And it will probably be much bigger when the list comes out in a few weeks .
2007_03_01_1829675	23	With $ 16 billion and a 10 percent rate of return , Mr. Ellison would need to spend more than $ 30 million a week simply to keep from accumulating more money than he already has , to say nothing of trying to spend down the $ 16 billion itself .
2007_03_01_1829675	24	He spent something like $ 100 million on his Japanese-style mansion in Woodside , Calif. , making it among the more expensive private residences ever built .
2007_03_01_1829675	25	But that is only about three weeks worth of the interest he earns on his wealth .
2007_03_01_1829675	26	And a house does n't actually spend down his net worth because it is an asset that can be resold .
2007_03_01_1829675	27	At least part of the $ 100 million is just a different way of saving .
2007_03_01_1829675	28	Mr. Ellison would have to spend that $ 30 million a week -- $ 183,000 an hour -- on things that ca n't be resold , like parties or meals , just to avoid increasing his wealth .
2007_03_01_1829675	29	While somebody might be able to spend like that -- Paris Hilton , maybe -- it certainly would n't be easy , and it ca n't explain why the super-rich accumulate .
2007_03_01_1829675	30	The last of the seemingly rational explanations is that the billionaires want to pass it on to their children .
2007_03_01_1829675	31	But , again , their fortunes are growing far faster than their number of heirs , so each of the children will have the same problems spending the money that their parents had .
2007_03_01_1829675	32	Sam Walton 's fortune is now divided among his family , and the Forbes list will probably show that his children account for 4 of the 10 richest Americans in the world ( with his wife being No. 11 ) .
2007_03_01_1829675	33	The children are in their 50s and 60s , and if they live to be 80 , and their wealth grows at 10 percent a year , their fortunes will rise by four to eight times and they will each have more than they can ever spend or their children can spend , and so on .
2007_03_01_1829675	34	Further , the data , according to Professor Carroll , just does n't indicate that children make much of a difference .
2007_03_01_1829675	35	He found in the government 's 1992 Survey of Consumer Finances , for example , that only 4 percent of the richest Americans said that providing an inheritance ranked in their top five reasons for saving .
2007_03_01_1829675	36	On top of that , he says , the data shows that elderly super-rich people who do not have children save just as much as the ones who do .
2007_03_01_1829675	37	If it is n't to spend , to give to their children , or to give to charity , then why do the rich save so much ?
2007_03_01_1829675	38	Professor Carroll says maybe they love money , not for what it can buy but just for its own sake .
2007_03_01_1829675	39	Perhaps they get something different from having money -- clout , power , the ability to dominate an industry .
2007_03_01_1829675	40	Or perhaps these are just competitive people who care about their position compared with other people on the list .
2007_03_01_1829675	41	They accumulate more so they can lord it over the other families who have less -- a bit like having enough nuclear weapons to blow up the world several times but making more to stay ahead of the other guy .
2007_03_01_1829675	42	However you look at it , though , it is n't for the reasons that everyone else saves money .
2007_03_01_1829675	43	In a few weeks , you will see the list of the world 's wealthiest people and how vastly their wealth has increased .
2007_03_01_1829675	44	Warren Buffett will probably be the only one pledging to give his fortune away .
2007_03_01_1829675	45	The other billionaires will probably think he 's crazy , but it may make him the most rational person on the list .

2007_03_01_1829677	1	Are they waiting for him to kill someone else 's son ? ''
2007_03_01_1829677	2	TOSHA BRASWELL , whose 15-year-old son was killed in Newark , on prosecutors who have not brought charges despite a witness 's identification .
2007_03_01_1829678	0	NATO and American forces knew that a suicide bomber was at large in the Bagram area before the suicide bomb attack on Tuesday that killed 23 people at the main gate of the United States air base where Vice President Dick Cheney was staying , a NATO spokesman said Wednesday .
2007_03_01_1829678	1	But despite the vice president 's presence , the Afghan police chief in the area said he had not been informed of the possible threat . ''
2007_03_01_1829678	2	We know for a fact that there has been recent intelligence to suggest that there was the threat of a bombing in the Bagram area , '' the spokesman , Col. Tom Collins , said at a news briefing in Kabul . ''
2007_03_01_1829678	3	It is clear there are suicide bombers ' cells operating in this country , '' he said . ''
2007_03_01_1829678	4	There are some operating in the city of Kabul and , as our intelligence suggests , they had the capability in the Bagram area . ''
2007_03_01_1829678	5	The Afghan police chief of Bagram district , Muhammad Salem Ehsas , said Wednesday that he had been unaware of any threat of a suicide bomber in the area , suggesting a lack of coordination between the security forces on the ground even while Mr. Cheney was present .
2007_03_01_1829678	6	Afghan police officers guard the outer gate at the Bagram air base , and it is possible that they let the bomber through to the second gate , which is operated by American soldiers and other members of the international military force .
2007_03_01_1829678	7	Commander Ehsas said it was also possible that the bomber gained access to the American gate through the residential areas near the base .
2007_03_01_1829678	8	At least 19 Afghan workers , including a 12-year-old boy , were killed in the blast , as were a South Korean soldier , an American soldier , an American civilian contractor and the bomber , the military said in a statement .
2007_03_01_1829678	9	Many of the workers were lined up outside the gate , waiting to clear the security checkpoint before going to work inside .
2007_03_01_1829678	10	Mr. Cheney spent the night at Bagram unexpectedly after heavy snow prevented him from getting to a meeting with President Hamid Karzai at the presidential palace in Kabul .
2007_03_01_1829678	11	Mr. Cheney was at the base when the bomber struck at 10 a.m. Tuesday , but he continued on to Kabul to meet President Karzai at midday as planned .
2007_03_01_1829678	12	The Taliban claimed responsibility for the blast and said it had been aimed at Mr. Cheney , and even named the bomber , saying he came from Logar , a province south of the capital , Kabul .
2007_03_01_1829678	13	But Colonel Collins said that their claim was '' absurd '' and that the timing of the bombing could have been just a coincidence . ''
2007_03_01_1829678	14	Their claim is simply going for more psychological impact on the population , '' he said . ''
2007_03_01_1829678	15	Clearly what they have done here is simply killing more innocent people . ''
2007_03_01_1829678	16	Afghanistan has been hit by more than 100 suicide bombings in the past year , and many have appeared to be opportunistic attacks , where the bombers had been walking , loitering or driving around looking for a target , usually a foreign military convoy .
2007_03_01_1829678	17	Others have approached military bases and government buildings on foot and set off their explosion at an entrance .
2007_03_01_1829678	18	The American military is conducting the investigation of the bomb blast , said Colonel Collins , the spokesman for the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force , or ISAF . ''
2007_03_01_1829678	19	Unfortunately , we do expect more attacks , '' he said . ''
2007_03_01_1829678	20	And the enemy knows that they can not defeat Afghan National Security Forces and ISAF forces in the conventional sense , so we do expect them increasingly to go after soft targets , which means civilians . ''
2007_03_01_1829678	21	Mr. Ehsas said he also believed that it was more likely that the bombing was an opportunistic attack against the civilians lined up at the gate . ''
2007_03_01_1829678	22	I do n't think it was connected to Cheney 's visit , '' he said . ''
2007_03_01_1829678	23	The aim was the people in the crowd . ''
2007_03_01_1829679	0	The top Iranian national security official , Ali Larijani , indicated Wednesday that Iranian officials would take part in a regional security conference on Iraq , setting the stage for the highest-level contact between American and Iranian officials in more than two years .
2007_03_01_1829679	1	A day after the Bush administration said it had agreed to such talks , Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki of Iraq announced Wednesday that the first stage of the conference would be held March 10 in Baghdad , the capital .
2007_03_01_1829679	2	The agenda will be how to rescue Iraq from a civil war that claimed about two dozen more lives on Wednesday , and that is likely to require the American military to maintain a greatly enlarged force in Baghdad until at least fall , a top United States commander said .
2007_03_01_1829679	3	In the deadliest attack on Wednesday , a car bomb exploded in a marketplace in the Bayaa district of Baghdad , killing 10 people and wounding 27 others , officials from the Interior Ministry and Yarmouk Hospital said .
2007_03_01_1829679	4	In central Baghdad , two Iraqi policemen died when a suicide bomber struck the entrance to the Bab al-Sheik police station .
2007_03_01_1829679	5	Also on Wednesday the American military command said a soldier was killed by small-arms fire in an unspecified western district of Baghdad on Tuesday while on patrol with the Iraqi national police .
2007_03_01_1829679	6	North of the capital in Diyala Province , where Sunni Arab insurgents and foreign fighters have been waging a deadly struggle for control against Shiite militias and death squads , two brothers of a prominent Sunni Arab member of the Iraqi national Parliament , Dr. Salim Abdullah , were shot to death on Wednesday , security officials there said .
2007_03_01_1829679	7	Also on Wednesday , mortar attacks killed at least six people and wounded 14 in Shurta , a neighborhood in western Baghdad , an Interior Ministry official said .
2007_03_01_1829679	8	Other mortar barrages have killed at least four people in the past two days near Iskandariya , a town south of Baghdad , the local police said .
2007_03_01_1829679	9	In Salahuddin Province north of Baghdad , two Iraqi policemen were killed in a drive-by shooting near Baiji .
2007_03_01_1829679	10	Farther north , in Mosul , a police colonel and his driver were shot dead in their car .
2007_03_01_1829679	11	Two weeks have passed since American forces began large-scale operations as part of the Baghdad security plan .
2007_03_01_1829679	12	Iraqi officials have called the plan a success , but American commanders are much more measured .
2007_03_01_1829679	13	Some American officers have said they believe many death squad and militia leaders fled the capital to avoid stepped up American patrols and will return once the Baghdad security plan is completed .
2007_03_01_1829679	14	The plan , which calls for 17,000 additional troops in Baghdad , will continue until at least this fall , the second-ranking commander in Iraq , Lt. Gen. Raymond T. Odierno , told CNN on Wednesday . ''
2007_03_01_1829679	15	I do n't want to put an exact time on it , but a minimum of six to nine months , '' General Odierno said .
2007_03_01_1829679	16	He also said that Sunni militants were responsible for about 70 percent of the attacks on American troops .
2007_03_01_1829679	17	The willingness of American officials to attend the March 10 security conference with Syrian and Iranian officials has been widely seen as reflecting a decision by the Bush administration to yield to critics who have argued that it should no longer avoid high-level contacts with Tehran .
2007_03_01_1829679	18	Mr. Larijani , in a statement translated into English on the official Iranian news agency Web site , said that the Iranian foreign minister , Manouchehr Mottaki , had received a formal invitation from his Iraqi counterpart , Hoshyar Zebari . ''
2007_03_01_1829679	19	We will participate in the conference of Iraqi neighboring states in Baghdad in March , if it will be of help to Baghdad , '' Mr. Larijani said . ''
2007_03_01_1829679	20	We will carry out everything necessary to advance Iraqi interests .
2007_03_01_1829679	21	Iraqi leaders have a great potential for administering the country 's affairs . ''
2007_03_01_1829679	22	Iraqi officials have also said that Syria has agreed to attend .
2007_03_01_1829680	0	The Department of Defense has identified 3,150 American service members who have died since the start of the Iraq war .

2007_03_01_1829681	0	Israeli undercover forces fatally shot three Islamic Jihad militants in Jenin in the West Bank on Wednesday , and nearby a large contingent of Israeli soldiers re-entered Nablus just a day after withdrawing .
2007_03_01_1829681	1	In recent days , Israeli forces have stepped up operations in the northern West Bank , a center of Palestinian militancy throughout the past six years of violence .
2007_03_01_1829681	2	Israeli security officials say many of the attacks against Israel in the past year , including shootings and suicide bombing attempts , have originated in Nablus and Jenin .
2007_03_01_1829681	3	However , Israel has maintained tight restrictions on both places , and the last West Bank suicide bomber to strike in Israel was in April 2006 .
2007_03_01_1829681	4	In the Gaza Strip , Ismail Haniya , the Palestinian prime minister , said the recent Israeli raids were intended to cause turmoil and undermine Palestinian efforts to form a national unity government . ''
2007_03_01_1829681	5	This escalation aims to abort the Palestinian and Arab steps which aim to break the siege imposed on our people , '' Mr. Haniya said .
2007_03_01_1829681	6	In the confrontation in Jenin on Wednesday , an undercover unit from the Israeli border police came under fire as it approached three Islamic Jihad men in a car , Israeli security officials said .
2007_03_01_1829681	7	Two of the militants were shot dead , and the third , Ashraf Saadi , escaped from the car but was fatally shot a moment later .
2007_03_01_1829681	8	Palestinians said he was killed while fleeing , but the Israeli officials said he was shot after he fired on the Israeli forces .
2007_03_01_1829681	9	One policeman was lightly injured , Israeli officials said .
2007_03_01_1829681	10	Israeli security officials described Mr. Saadi as a senior Islamic Jihad commander in the area who was responsible for previous attacks against Israel .
2007_03_01_1829681	11	He also organized an attempted suicide bombing last week in the Tel Aviv area , the security officials said .
2007_03_01_1829681	12	In that case , the bomber was arrested at an apartment near Tel Aviv , and then led the police to the spot were his explosives were hidden , the police said .
2007_03_01_1829681	13	Islamic Jihad has been involved in almost all the suicide bombings against Israel in recent years , and Jenin is one of the group 's strongholds . ''
2007_03_01_1829681	14	This new crime will not pass without tough punishment , '' Abu Ahmad , a spokesman for the group in the Gaza Strip , said in a text message .
2007_03_01_1829681	15	In response to the Israeli raid in Jenin , Islamic Jihad militants in Gaza fired five rockets into southern Israel , but they caused no injuries or serious damage .
2007_03_01_1829681	16	In Nablus , meanwhile , Israeli forces pulled out of the old city , or casbah , before dawn on Tuesday after three days of searches for militants , which led to five arrests .
2007_03_01_1829681	17	The forces , traveling in jeeps and armored vehicles , returned early Wednesday morning and reimposed a curfew as they began another round of searches .
2007_03_01_1829681	18	One Israeli soldier was moderately wounded by a bomb , and Israel announced no new arrests .
2007_03_01_1829681	19	The military did not say why the forces returned a day after leaving , though the break allowed the tens of thousands of residents in the city center to restock food and other supplies .
2007_03_01_1829681	20	In the latest ethics scandal involving an Israeli official , Esterina Tartman , a member of Parliament and the nominee to become tourism minister , said Wednesday that she would not seek the post after it was revealed that she made false claims about her education and business experience .
2007_03_01_1829681	21	Ms. Tartman , a member of the far-right Yisrael Beiteinu party , had said she had a bachelor 's degree from Hebrew University and a master 's degree from Bar-Ilan University .
2007_03_01_1829681	22	But the two universities said she never enrolled .
2007_03_01_1829681	23	She also claimed that she had been a vice president of a bank , but the bank said she had held a lower ranking position .
2007_03_01_1829681	24	Several leading Israeli politicians have been involved in scandals or have come under investigation recently .
2007_03_01_1829681	25	Israel 's attorney general has indicated that he plans to indict President Moshe Katsav on charges of rape and sexual assault .
2007_03_01_1829681	26	Prime Minister Ehud Olmert is under investigation involving actions taken when he was finance minister in 2005 .
2007_03_01_1829681	27	And Haim Ramon , the former justice minister , was convicted in January of sexual misconduct .
2007_03_01_1829682	0	Subpoenas were served on the offices of Gov. Jon S. Corzine and his chief counsel on Wednesday seeking documents about last-minute appropriations that have been added to state budgets since 2004 .
2007_03_01_1829682	1	Anthony Coley , a spokesman for the governor , said that Mr. Corzine 's office would comply with the subpoena and that Mr. Corzine had directed Attorney General Stuart Rabner and his own counsel 's office to oversee that compliance .
2007_03_01_1829682	2	Experts in state government said that while subpoenas of the governor 's office were not common , they were not unprecedented .
2007_03_01_1829682	3	The subpoenas , issued by the office of Christopher J. Christie , the United States attorney for New Jersey , were among several that he has served on state politicians over the last month .
2007_03_01_1829682	4	Republican and Democratic lawmakers acknowledged last week that their legislative offices had been subpoenaed for documents in connection with the appropriations , known as '' Christmas tree items . ''
2007_03_01_1829682	5	And earlier in February , a similar subpoena was delivered to the Office of Legislative Services , the Legislature 's research , analysis and legal arm .
2007_03_01_1829682	6	In addition , officials with knowledge of the subpoenas said that last week , Mr. Christie sought similar budget records from the Department of Treasury and the state 's Department of Community Affairs .
2007_03_01_1829682	7	Over the last five years , both offices played a role in dispensing the money for the Christmas tree items , which often found their way into the budget with little debate or review .
2007_03_01_1829682	8	The Treasury subpoena specifically mentioned contacts between the department and State Senator Wayne R. Bryant '' regarding matters involving the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey or any of its schools or departments , '' as well as pension benefits due to Mr. Bryant , according to one of the officials with knowledge of the investigation .
2007_03_01_1829682	9	The Senate president , Richard J. Codey , whose office was among those subpoenaed last week , said that from what he knew of the latest subpoenas , they were not aimed at the governor specifically .
2007_03_01_1829682	10	The United States attorney 's office is simply gathering more records for its investigation , he said .
2007_03_01_1829682	11	Mr. Christie 's office would not comment on his investigation or on the latest subpoenas .
2007_03_01_1829682	12	Many lawmakers have said they believe that despite the wide net the prosecutor is casting , the investigation is focused mainly on Senator Bryant , a Camden County Democrat who once headed the Senate Budget Committee .
2007_03_01_1829682	13	Mr. Bryant stepped down from that post after revelations that he had held a $ 38,000-a-year job with the University of Medicine and Dentistry in which he did little or no work , according to federal monitors .
2007_03_01_1829682	14	Federal investigators , according to lawmakers , are trying to determine whether the job was given to Mr. Bryant in exchange for helping the school secure funds through the Christmas tree items .
2007_03_01_1829682	15	Under the practice , legislators would try to get money included in the budget for broad purposes , like helping the elderly , that dovetailed with specific projects being sought by governments or nonprofit groups in their districts .
2007_03_01_1829682	16	The government or group would then have to apply for grants to the state agencies that administered them , and if approved , the funds would be disbursed .
2007_03_01_1829682	17	Edward Hartnett , an expert in state law who teaches at Seton Hall University Law School , said the subpoenas were not so unusual , and pointed out that '' just because you are seeking information from someone , it does not mean that they have done anything wrong . '' ''
2007_03_01_1829682	18	But it has to make people edgy and worried about what exactly they have said or written down , '' he said .
2007_03_01_1829683	0	The Manhattan district attorney 's office has found that there is no basis to prosecute a city police inspector for perjury or any other offense related to arrests at protest rallies during the 2004 Republican National Convention .
2007_03_01_1829683	1	In a letter faxed yesterday to the New York Civil Liberties Union , James M. Kindler , chief assistant district attorney , said that his office had looked into the group 's complaint that police officers had not given hundreds of demonstrators proper warnings to disperse before arresting them , and that a police inspector had lied about whether such warnings had been given .
2007_03_01_1829683	2	Mr. Kindler said his office took the complaint seriously because of the gravity of the allegations and the importance of basing criminal prosecutions on accurate information .
2007_03_01_1829683	3	But , he said in his letter , '' After careful consideration , we have concluded that the evidence does not support or warrant a prosecution for perjury or any other offense . ''
2007_03_01_1829683	4	In response to Mr. Kindler 's letter , Christopher Dunn , associate legal director of the civil liberties union , said yesterday , '' The fact that most of the cases were later dismissed does nothing to undo the harm to those who were falsely arrested and prosecuted , nor does it allay our concerns about false statements by police officials about the circumstances of convention arrests . ''
2007_03_01_1829683	5	The investigation grew out of a letter that the civil liberties group sent last March to Robert M. Morgenthau , the Manhattan district attorney , suggesting that the Police Department may have provided false information to prosecute people arrested in demonstrations on East 16th Street near Union Square and on Fulton Street , near the World Trade Center site , in August 2004 .
2007_03_01_1829683	6	Those were , according to the civil liberties union , the largest mass arrests during the convention ; nearly 400 people were arrested at East 16th Street .
2007_03_01_1829683	7	In a deposition taken on behalf of demonstrators who claimed to have been falsely arrested , a police inspector , James Essig , answered '' no '' when asked whether he had given demonstrators a warning to disperse or be arrested , according to the civil liberties group .
2007_03_01_1829683	8	The group said Inspector Essig 's deposition testimony contradicted a sworn statement attached to the Criminal Court complaints , saying that he and other police officials gave the demonstrators a proper warning .
2007_03_01_1829683	9	A police spokesman said that Inspector Essig 's answer had been taken out of context and that he was simply saying he did not remember what words he used to tell the demonstrators to leave .
2007_03_01_1829683	10	In his letter yesterday , Mr. Kindler noted that all the criminal cases arising from the Fulton Street protest had been dismissed on a motion by his office in October 2004 .
2007_03_01_1829683	11	Most of the cases arising from the East 16th Street demonstration had also been dismissed , his letter said .
2007_03_01_1829683	12	Of the 10 convictions in the East 16th Street protest , it turned out that none of the defendants were convicted of disorderly conduct for '' failing to comply with a lawful order of the police '' -- the only charge that required proof that a dispersal order was given , Mr. Kindler said . ''
2007_03_01_1829683	13	All the convictions were on other charges , and nearly all were based on guilty pleas , '' he said .
2007_03_01_1829683	14	In two cases , he continued , the defendants were convicted after trial , but Inspector Essig 's order to disperse was not an issue .
2007_03_01_1829683	15	In one case , the charge of failing to comply with an order to disperse was dismissed before trial , he said .
2007_03_01_1829683	16	Paul J. Browne , deputy police commissioner , declined to comment yesterday on Mr. Kindler 's letter .
2007_03_01_1829683	17	In an interview yesterday , Mr. Kindler said : '' Large demonstrations often present the police with confusing and difficult situations , and drawing individualized complaints where large numbers of demonstrators have been arrested is not an easy task .
2007_03_01_1829683	18	Complaints arising out of R.N.C. demonstrations need to be evaluated in that light . ''
2007_03_01_1829685	0	China and the United States are close to an accord to let North Korea regain some of the $ 25 million in its funds frozen in a bank in Macao now that it has agreed to start dismantling its nuclear arms program , American officials said Wednesday .
2007_03_01_1829685	1	The American officials said arrangements for North Korea to get a portion of the funds frozen at Banco Delta Asia , a small family-owned bank accused of money laundering , have been the subject of intense discussions this week in China .
2007_03_01_1829685	2	A deal could be announced in the next few weeks , they said .
2007_03_01_1829685	3	The issue of the funds , frozen a year and a half ago , was a major factor in the off-again-on-again six-party negotiations with North Korea over its nuclear program .
2007_03_01_1829685	4	North Korea angrily boycotted the talks for most of the last year , charging that the bank action was based on false charges and was an example of economic coercion .
2007_03_01_1829685	5	The intention to ease the freeze on the North Korean funds was not announced at the time of the North Korea accord reached on Feb. 13 , but officials said at the time that they expected the issue to be resolved .
2007_03_01_1829685	6	Daniel Glaser , a deputy under secretary of the Treasury , has been in China this week for discussions about the subject .
2007_03_01_1829685	7	Mr. Glaser said this week that the United States had gone through more than 300,000 documents from Banco Delta Asia and consulted on them with both North Korea and China .
2007_03_01_1829685	8	The effort , American officials said , was meant to determine which of the North Korean funds were tainted by illegal activities and which were legitimate . ''
2007_03_01_1829685	9	All of this work that we 've done has put us in a position where we can begin to take steps to resolve the Banco Delta Asia matter , '' Mr. Glaser told reporters in Hong Kong on Monday .
2007_03_01_1829685	10	He said the resolution of the matter would be completed '' in a timely fashion '' and '' as quickly as possible . ''
2007_03_01_1829685	11	The expected return of some of the frozen funds to North Korea -- officials involved in the discussions say the sum could exceed $ 12 million -- offers a striking case study of how the United States has used its financial laws to extend its reach to foreign banks and isolate a country from the international financial system .
2007_03_01_1829685	12	Christopher R. Hill , the assistant secretary of state who negotiated the nuclear deal with North Korea , said Wednesday that he had no doubt that freezing the funds compelled North Korea to negotiate . ''
2007_03_01_1829685	13	I think they were concerned about the fact that we were able to go after an important note of their financing , '' he said , testifying before the House Foreign Affairs Committee .
2007_03_01_1829685	14	Mr. Hill added that the agreement on nuclear matters meant no easing of American concerns over North Korea 's illicit activities on drugs , weapons or counterfeiting . ''
2007_03_01_1829685	15	I can assure you that we have not , and will not , trade progress on denuclearization by turning a blind eye to some of these other activities , '' he said .
2007_03_01_1829685	16	The Bush administration hopes to replicate the North Korean experience with Iran , but American officials involved in the planning acknowledge that this might be more difficult because Iran has a web of banking relationships throughout Europe and the Middle East .
2007_03_01_1829685	17	Sanctions against Iran approved by the United Nations Security Council in December have contributed to Iran 's economic isolation , administration officials say .
2007_03_01_1829685	18	In addition , Treasury steps similar to those against Banco Delta Asia have forced Iranian banks to carry out transactions , including the sale of oil , in currencies other than the dollar .
2007_03_01_1829685	19	These steps have complicated business deals and the willingness of some foreign companies to invest in Iran , energy experts say .
2007_03_01_1829685	20	Recently , for example , Russia said it was slowing its investment in an Iranian civilian nuclear plant , saying that it objected to being paid in euros .
2007_03_01_1829685	21	Banco Delta Asia was seen in financial circles as an early test case of American efforts to use such sanctions against not only North Korea but also other countries charged with supporting terrorism or illegal weapons proliferation .
2007_03_01_1829685	22	In 2005 , for example , the Bush administration labeled Banco Delta Asia a '' primary money laundering concern '' and charged that it was helping North Korea carry out counterfeiting , narcotics trafficking and other illicit activities .
2007_03_01_1829685	23	North Korea denied the accusations , and Banco Delta Asia , in filings with the Treasury Department , said it had no evidence of such activities for North Korea .
2007_03_01_1829685	24	Nevertheless , the bank and the Chinese government closed accounts of 20 North Korean banks , 11 North Korean trading companies , 9 North Korean citizens and 8 Macao-based companies that do business with North Korea , according to bank records .
2007_03_01_1829685	25	The bank also promised to cease any further business with North Korea or its business partners .
2007_03_01_1829685	26	American officials have suggested that some of these accounts helped North Korea 's leader , Kim Jong-il , maintain a lavish lifestyle in Pyongyang , the capital .
2007_03_01_1829685	27	While the $ 25 million in Banco Delta Asia is believed to be a small part of North Korea 's financial activities with the outside world , it reflects only the amount of money in the bank at the time the funds were frozen .
2007_03_01_1829685	28	The volume of transactions conducted by the bank for North Korea could involve many times that amount of money , according to people close to the investigation into the bank .
2007_03_01_1829685	29	The main enforcement tool by the United States was an announcement that it was considering a step barring American banks from doing business in dollars with Banco Delta Asia , effectively threatening to shut it out of the international banking system .
2007_03_01_1829685	30	To protect themselves , American banks then stopped doing business with Banco Delta Asia .
2007_03_01_1829685	31	Those steps , in turn , forced the bank to shut itself down , hand itself over to the Chinese government and freeze all funds linked to North Korea .
2007_03_01_1829687	0	Analysts have been stumped by the apparent resilience of the American economy , which seemed to be bounding ahead at a 3.5 percent pace in the final quarter of last year even as the housing market fell and the Federal Reserve raised interest rates .
2007_03_01_1829687	1	The paradox has been solved : the economy was not bounding .
2007_03_01_1829687	2	The Commerce Department reported yesterday that economic growth inched ahead by 2.2 percent in the fourth quarter of last year , only slightly faster than the 2 percent growth recorded in the third quarter and substantially below the economy 's long-term trend rate of growth The downward revision , by 1.3 percentage points , in the preliminary estimate of gross domestic product was almost three times the average adjustment since the early 1980s , which is 0.5 percentage point .
2007_03_01_1829687	3	Coupled with a 17 percent decline in new-home sales in January and a 7.8 percent drop last month in orders of durable goods like computers and washing machines , the new data indicated the economy was much weaker than it seemed . ''
2007_03_01_1829687	4	I think we are going to discover that the economy is softer than the Fed thinks , '' said Robert Barbera , chief economist at ITG Hoenig .
2007_03_01_1829687	5	In Congressional testimony , the chairman of the Federal Reserve , Ben S. Bernanke , offered a sanguine view .
2007_03_01_1829687	6	He said the revised numbers were '' more consistent with our view of the economy '' than the prior estimates .
2007_03_01_1829687	7	He said the Fed expected '' moderate growth '' going forward , which could pick up by midyear if housing managed to break its fall .
2007_03_01_1829687	8	But concerns over the prospects of a slowing economy were heightened by the steep declines in equity markets around the globe on Tuesday , which came after a near 9 percent drop in the Shanghai market .
2007_03_01_1829687	9	Investors were also given the jitters by comments made to a business conference in Hong Kong on Monday by the former Fed chairman , Alan Greenspan .
2007_03_01_1829687	10	Mr. Greenspan warned that the American economy could be in recession by the end of the year .
2007_03_01_1829687	11	Not many economists agree that a recession is in sight .
2007_03_01_1829687	12	Still , the slowing economy , economists say , should eventually take its toll on jobs . ''
2007_03_01_1829687	13	It virtually guarantees labor market deterioration in the form of a higher unemployment rate , '' said Jan Hatzius , chief United States economist at Goldman Sachs .
2007_03_01_1829687	14	While the statement of the Fed 's interest-rate-setting committee in January expressed more concern about inflation than about growth , warning '' inflation risks remain , '' economists say evidence of slower growth is likely to refocus the Fed 's attention . ''
2007_03_01_1829687	15	They are going to discover in the next 90 days that they are leaning the wrong way , '' Mr. Barbera added .
2007_03_01_1829687	16	Not all of the economic news was bad .
2007_03_01_1829687	17	Inflation appeared tamer in the revised G.D.P. report than earlier estimates indicated .
2007_03_01_1829687	18	The price index for consumer goods excluding food and energy , the inflation gauge most favored by the Fed , rose at an annual rate of only 1.9 percent in the last three months of 2006 , less than the 2.1 percent originally reported .
2007_03_01_1829687	19	Moreover , about half of the revision to gross domestic product was because of lower inventory accumulation than the government had previously estimated .
2007_03_01_1829687	20	This means that companies have lower stocks of unsold goods in their warehouses , which would force them to increase production quicker to respond to consumer demand .
2007_03_01_1829687	21	Also , the consumer confidence index of the Conference Board reached a five-year high in January .
2007_03_01_1829687	22	But there are more signs of economic weakness .
2007_03_01_1829687	23	Trade , which had been thought to add 1.64 percentage points to growth in the quarter , added only 1.5 percentage points , according to the revised data .
2007_03_01_1829687	24	The growth in consumer spending in the fourth quarter of last year was brought down a notch in the revised report , to 4.2 percent from 4.4 percent .
2007_03_01_1829687	25	And much of this growth was merely because of a fall in prices .
2007_03_01_1829687	26	In nominal dollars , consumer spending slowed markedly .
2007_03_01_1829687	27	Housing , it seems , still has a way to fall .
2007_03_01_1829687	28	The Commerce Department reported that builders faced a growing glut of unsold homes in January as the pace of new-home sales slowed 16.6 percent -- the most in 13 years .
2007_03_01_1829687	29	The seasonally adjusted annual sales rate fell to 937,000 last month from 1.1 million in December .
2007_03_01_1829687	30	Compared with a year earlier , January 's rate was down 20.1 percent .
2007_03_01_1829687	31	Since the housing market hit its peak in the summer of 2005 , new-home sales have fallen by nearly a third .
2007_03_01_1829687	32	But perhaps the more troubling adjustment in the G.D.P. report was to investment by businesses .
2007_03_01_1829687	33	Capital investment growth had been one of the sunnier components of economic activity in the second half of last year , picking up some slack from the collapse in residential construction -- which declined 19 percent in the final quarter of last year .
2007_03_01_1829687	34	Yet according to the revised figures , nonresidential investment in things like factories and computers declined by 2.4 percent in the fourth quarter , much more than the original estimate of a 0.4 percent decline . ''
2007_03_01_1829687	35	Corporations have become a little more risk averse , '' said Nariman Behravesh , chief economist at Global Insight in Lexington , Mass. .
2007_03_01_1829687	36	The economic outlook could deteriorate further if Tuesday 's financial turbulence intensifies .
2007_03_01_1829687	37	Yesterday , American equity markets recovered some of their Tuesday loss .
2007_03_01_1829687	38	But many markets in Asia and Europe fell for a second consecutive day .
2007_03_01_1829687	39	And there are weak points in the American financial system -- mortgage-backed bonds , for instance .
2007_03_01_1829687	40	Yet , barring a financial disaster , many economists say they believe that a recession will be averted .
2007_03_01_1829687	41	This is contingent on proper action by the Fed . ''
2007_03_01_1829687	42	There is substantial downward pressure on growth , '' Mr. Hatzius said . ''
2007_03_01_1829687	43	But with little to worry about inflation pressures , there is no reason that monetary policy could n't provide enough support to stabilize things . ''
2007_03_01_1829688	0	MADISON AVENUE is taking a cue from the adage that history repeats itself first as tragedy and then as farce .
2007_03_01_1829688	1	In a trend perhaps also inspired by the popular 1980 movie '' Airplane !
2007_03_01_1829688	2	, '' agencies are hiring venerable actors , once known for serious straight roles , to display cleverly self-mocking sides of their personalities in campaigns aimed at younger as well as older consumers .
2007_03_01_1829688	3	The stars of the ads are ( mostly ) men , among them Robert Goulet , Peter Graves , George Hamilton , Ricardo Montalban , Burt Reynolds and William Shatner .
2007_03_01_1829688	4	One female celebrity taking part is Charo .
2007_03_01_1829688	5	The spots offer celebrities another day in the limelight , while giving older consumers a chance to revisit the stars from their childhood , this time indulging in funny shtick .
2007_03_01_1829688	6	Younger consumers often appreciate the wink-wink , nudge-nudge aspects of the self-referential tone .
2007_03_01_1829688	7	For advertisers , the older actors can be reassuring -- they are unlikely to fall out of favor by behaving badly .
2007_03_01_1829688	8	In one spot , Peter Graves , who took a turn at self-parody in '' Airplane !
2007_03_01_1829688	9	, '' takes part in a testimonial for Geico insurance created by the Martin Agency in Richmond , Va. , part of the Interpublic Group of Companies .
2007_03_01_1829688	10	Mr. Graves sits next to a Geico customer as she talks about the company 's good service .
2007_03_01_1829688	11	He interprets her words with the deadpan delivery he used in '' Mission : Impossible , '' including the use of a phrase one just does not expect Mr. Graves to utter : '' I put on some tangerine lip gloss . ''
2007_03_01_1829688	12	Steve Bassett , creative director at Martin , said the commercial works in part because the celebrities are cultural icons . ''
2007_03_01_1829688	13	You do n't have to catch up , trying to figure out who these people are , '' Mr. Bassett said .
2007_03_01_1829688	14	The perpetually tan Mr. Hamilton stars in a campaign by the Chicago office of JWT , part of the WPP Group , for Nabisco Toasted Chips , sold by Kraft Foods .
2007_03_01_1829688	15	In one ad for Pita Thins , Mr. Hamilton samples the product with his former foe from '' Dancing With the Stars , '' the wrestling hottie Stacy Keibler ; he then breaks into solo acrobatics in a colorful Greek costume and affirms with a wink at his bronzed self , '' I know toasted . ''
2007_03_01_1829688	16	A spokeswoman for Kraft Foods , Laurie Guzzinati , said that Mr. Hamilton was chosen because '' his charisma , humor and charm fit with the consumer , brand and platform . ''
2007_03_01_1829688	17	And '' women across multiple age groups , '' who are the target market , '' love him , '' Ms. Guzzinati said .
2007_03_01_1829688	18	In what may be the longest association between a celebrity and a brand , Mr. Shatner has been working for Priceline.com for a decade .
2007_03_01_1829688	19	The association has even outlasted agencies ; he returned in January for a new campaign from the new Priceline agency , Butler , Shine , Stern & Partners in Sausalito , Calif. .
2007_03_01_1829688	20	The latest campaign presents Mr. Shatner as '' the Negotiator , '' fielding calls from distraught would-be travelers and making deals for them .
2007_03_01_1829688	21	In one spot , he charms a female hotel clerk into marking down a room . ''
2007_03_01_1829688	22	Sometimes doing the wrong thing can feel so right , '' Mr. Shatner says as he places his hand over hers on the computer 's mouse .
2007_03_01_1829688	23	When she discounts the room by half , he purrs , '' You 're so naughty . ''
2007_03_01_1829688	24	Brett Keller , chief marketing officer at Priceline.com , said Mr. Shatner was chosen in 1997 because it was the dawn of the online era and the actor , best known for his '' Star Trek '' role as Captain James T. Kirk , '' stood for the future , and we were a futuristic brand . ''
2007_03_01_1829688	25	Why do these long-shining stars who parody their own images work so well ? ''
2007_03_01_1829688	26	They are making use of the peripheral rather than the central route to persuasion , '' said Rod A. Martin , professor of psychology at the University of Western Ontario and the author of '' The Psychology of Humor : An Integrative Approach . ''
2007_03_01_1829688	27	It is '' difficult to make a compelling , logical , rational argument for these products ' superiority over their rivals , '' Mr. Martin said , so advertisers need to '' evoke positive associations with the product in the minds of the viewers without encouraging them to think too much about it . ''
2007_03_01_1829688	28	That was what Taco Bell seems to be doing with a campaign from Draft FCB in Chicago , part of Interpublic , for its steak grilled taquitos .
2007_03_01_1829688	29	In the commercials , two lions discuss the pronunciation of '' carne asada . ''
2007_03_01_1829688	30	One lion rolls the '' r '' to say the word as '' carrrne '' as the other one tries to .
2007_03_01_1829688	31	Finally , the first lion urges the second to '' think sexy like Ricardo Montalban . ''
2007_03_01_1829688	32	The second lion asks , '' Ricardo Montalban ?
2007_03_01_1829688	33	, '' as the actor 's voice intones , '' Taco Bell 's new steak grilled taquitos with carne asada steak .
2007_03_01_1829688	34	For authentic carrrne asada . ''
2007_03_01_1829688	35	Mr. Montalban , who decades ago purred the praises of '' rich Corinthian leather '' for Chrysler , was '' the perfect fit '' for Taco Bell , said Martin Hennessey , senior director for brand communications at Taco Bell , part of Yum Brands , because '' his appeal is timeless and he provides the ad with that unexpected punch that our customers associate with Taco Bell . ''
2007_03_01_1829688	36	The Super Bowl brought the first commercials in an offbeat campaign for Emerald nuts that gives Mr. Goulet , the actor and singer , a new persona that is wildly out of character .
2007_03_01_1829688	37	In the Emerald ads by Goodby , Silverstein & Partners in San Francisco , part of the Omnicom Group , Mr. Goulet behaves like a gremlin .
2007_03_01_1829688	38	He is seen pawing through the belongings of office workers and interfering with their work .
2007_03_01_1829688	39	The commercials proclaim that a midafternoon snack of Emerald nuts will keep Mr. Goulet away so his nefarious pranks will not prevent you from performing your job .
2007_03_01_1829688	40	A chastened Mr. Goulet slinks away on the ceiling .
2007_03_01_1829688	41	Mr. Goulet is recognizable , said Andrew Burke , vice president for marketing at Diamond Foods , the maker of Emerald nuts , but not so well known that consumers are tired of seeing him .
2007_03_01_1829688	42	That enabled Diamond to follow up the Super Bowl campaign , he added , with additional marketing programs that make Mr. Goulet '' that much more tied to Emerald nuts . ''
2007_03_01_1829688	43	The newest member of the gang of old stars is Mr. Reynolds , who in two campaigns mocks his image from the 1970s as a sex god .
2007_03_01_1829688	44	He appears in print ads for the M&M 's brand of candies sold by the Masterfoods USA division of Mars as an M&M version of how he appeared in the 1977 movie '' Smokey and the Bandit . ''
2007_03_01_1829688	45	The M&M 's ad was created by BBDO Worldwide in New York , a division of Omnicom .
2007_03_01_1829688	46	And in the recent swimsuit issue of Sports Illustrated , DirecTV -- in an ad created by Deutsch in New York , an Interpublic agency -- reprinted the 1972 centerfold of Mr. Reynolds from Cosmopolitan magazine ( minus the cigarette he had in the original ) . ''

2007_03_01_1829689	1	Terms of the deal , which is expected to be announced today , were not disclosed .
2007_03_01_1829689	2	Ecount will be Citigroup 's latest purchase in the last few months aimed at improving the company 's sluggish performance .
2007_03_01_1829689	3	Charles O. Prince III , Citigroup 's chairman and chief executive , is under pressure from investors to reverse years of disappointing results .
2007_03_01_1829689	4	Ecount , a nine-year-old company based near Philadelphia , has developed a prepaid rewards card program that has about 1,000 corporate customers .
2007_03_01_1829689	5	With the acquisition , Citigroup 's Global Transaction Services group plans to offer the cards to its 41,000 corporate and government clients .
2007_03_01_1829689	6	Transaction growth in prepaid cards is expected to rise more than 50 percent this year , according to the Nilson Report , a newsletter for the payments industry .
2007_03_01_1829689	7	Government agencies use the cards to dispense welfare payments , and many companies use them to reimburse employees or pay people who do not have bank accounts .
2007_03_01_1829690	0	Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo said in a legal opinion on Wednesday that the boards of two state housing authorities illegally granted themselves lifetime health insurance benefits at state expense .
2007_03_01_1829690	1	The opinion , requested by the recently appointed chief executive of both agencies , the New York State Housing Finance Agency and the State of New York Mortgage Agency , means the boards will not receive the benefits from the HIP Health Plan .
2007_03_01_1829690	2	An aide to Mr. Cuomo said the attorney general 's office would now investigate whether other state authority boards are receiving benefits they are not legally entitled to .
2007_03_01_1829690	3	The housing boards -- whose agencies are interrelated and whose members are not supposed to be compensated -- granted themselves the benefits in the last days of the Pataki administration .
2007_03_01_1829690	4	Priscilla Almodovar , who was appointed chief executive of both agencies by Gov. Eliot Spitzer , questioned the actions after she took over and moved quickly to freeze the benefit payments .
2007_03_01_1829690	5	The benefits were to be paid to current and retired board members and would have had the agencies pay the premiums ' full cost . ''
2007_03_01_1829690	6	We conclude the agencies are without legal authority to pay for any portion of the health insurance premiums , '' Mr. Cuomo wrote in his opinion .
2007_03_01_1829690	7	The insurance contracts , he added , are void .
2007_03_01_1829690	8	Ms. Almodovar said in a statement : '' We are pleased that the attorney general 's office has responded to our request for an opinion so quickly and has clarified that the agencies ' prior practice of paying for health insurance benefits for current and retired board members was inappropriate . ''
2007_03_01_1829690	9	That practice will now end . ''
2007_03_01_1829691	0	New York 's top Democrats have spoken for weeks about trying to wrest control of the Republican-led State Senate by persuading a few Republican senators to switch parties or retire .
2007_03_01_1829691	1	The Senate 's minority leader , Malcolm A. Smith of Queens , even introduced a new acronym to Albany when he announced that several Republicans were in the ZOPA , or '' zone of possible agreement . ''
2007_03_01_1829691	2	So it was with more than a little glee that the Senate majority leader , Joseph L. Bruno , announced on Wednesday that he was making Carl Kruger , a Democratic senator from Brooklyn with a history of endorsing Republicans , the chairman of a Senate committee .
2007_03_01_1829691	3	Typically , only Republicans get such positions .
2007_03_01_1829691	4	Republican senators and their staffs had been a bit gloomy since the loss of a seat in a special election on Long Island that reduced their majority in the 62-member chamber to four seats , 33 to 29 .
2007_03_01_1829691	5	Now they were the ones greeting each other with calls of '' ZOPA ! ''
2007_03_01_1829691	6	But Senator Kruger -- a maverick who has supported George E. Pataki and other Republicans in the past , but endorsed Eliot Spitzer for governor last year -- said he intended to remain a Democrat and hoped the Democrats win a majority of the Senate '' sooner rather than later . ''
2007_03_01_1829691	7	Of course , Democrats outnumber Republicans in his district in southern Brooklyn by nearly four to one .
2007_03_01_1829691	8	And the two Democratic senators from New York City whom Senator Bruno persuaded to join or vote with the Republicans in recent years , Olga A. Mendez and Pedro Espada Jr. , both lost their seats in subsequent elections .
2007_03_01_1829691	9	Senator Kruger 's new position as chairman of the Committee on Social Services , Children and Families , comes with a stipend of $ 12,500 on top of his regular salary of $ 79,500 .
2007_03_01_1829691	10	If this was a setback for Mr. Smith , he was not showing it .
2007_03_01_1829691	11	Mr. Smith held a news conference at which he shared a lectern with Mr. Kruger and took credit for the move , saying that he had been urging Mr. Bruno to give Democrats more authority .
2007_03_01_1829691	12	But Mr. Smith acknowledged that neither Mr. Kruger nor Mr. Bruno had told him what was afoot .
2007_03_01_1829691	13	Several Democratic senators , speaking privately , questioned whether the move would give Mr. Bruno more influence over Mr. Kruger .
2007_03_01_1829691	14	In the past , Democratic senators have been wooed to switch parties with the promise of more money for their districts in the form of member items , which are controlled by the Republicans in the majority .
2007_03_01_1829691	15	Asked if Mr. Kruger would be getting more money for his district , Senator Bruno said merely , '' Any other questions ? ''
2007_03_01_1829691	16	Senator Kruger , for his part , said , '' There was no quid pro quo I 've made , nor was I asked to make any commitments . ''

2007_03_01_1829697	0	In a way , the stock market 's rebound yesterday was as troubling as Tuesday 's rout .
2007_03_01_1829697	1	Ben Bernanke , the chairman of the Federal Reserve , managed to calm the market , saying that one could reasonably hope for a stronger economy by midyear if housing stabilized soon , and if manufacturing strengthened .
2007_03_01_1829697	2	But those are big ifs .
2007_03_01_1829697	3	The torrent of bad news on housing is only worsening , with a report yesterday that new home sales for January had their steepest slide in 13 years .
2007_03_01_1829697	4	And as David Leonhardt pointed out in yesterday 's Times , manufacturing has already slipped into a recession , with activity contracting in two of the last three months .
2007_03_01_1829697	5	How is it then that investors took Mr. Bernanke 's words as a '' buy '' signal ?
2007_03_01_1829697	6	The short answer is that investors have a proclivity to hear what they want to hear .
2007_03_01_1829697	7	On Tuesday , warning bells were simply too loud to ignore , including the steep sell-off in stocks in Shanghai , downbeat reports on the United States economy and an attempt in Afghanistan on the life of Vice President Dick Cheney .
2007_03_01_1829697	8	Yesterday , investors needed only the slightest prod to revert to '' hear no evil '' form .
2007_03_01_1829697	9	The more complete answer is also more troubling .
2007_03_01_1829697	10	In recent years , as housing and stock markets surged , even highly speculative investors have been encouraged to an unusual degree by their bankers and regulators , who are supposed to restrain investors ' more maniacal bents , but instead have done little to quell or question excessive risk-taking .
2007_03_01_1829697	11	Just last week , Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson Jr. and top financial regulators said the government need not -- and should not -- provide greater oversight for the $ 1.4 trillion hedge fund industry , or , by extension , the trillions of dollars more in complex derivative transactions spawned by the industry .
2007_03_01_1829697	12	That stance is mostly free-market ideology run amok .
2007_03_01_1829697	13	But it is also based on the unproven assumption that unregulated investing , which dispersed risk and reduced volatility as markets surged , will continue to do so when markets tank .
2007_03_01_1829697	14	The upshot is a one-sided bet for investors .
2007_03_01_1829697	15	They have explicit assurances from regulators and policy makers that almost anything goes when the markets are hot , and implicit assurances -- based on past experience -- that the Fed would lower interest rates to contain a financial crisis should one erupt .
2007_03_01_1829697	16	Unfortunately , there is no guarantee that easing up on rates would have the same powerful effect in a future crisis as it had in the past .
2007_03_01_1829697	17	The next crisis appears to be building around weakness in the United States , not in Russia or Asia or South America .
2007_03_01_1829697	18	That means money could flow out of the country if markets were rattled .
2007_03_01_1829697	19	That would weaken the dollar and require speedy and complex remedial action by the world 's central banks -- not just a rate cut by the Fed .
2007_03_01_1829697	20	Tuesday 's stock market decline could turn out to have been a garden-variety correction .
2007_03_01_1829697	21	But major market participants would be wise to rethink their assumptions .
2007_03_01_1829698	0	There were so many reasons to be appalled by President Bush 's decision to detain people illegally and subject them to mental and physical abuse .
2007_03_01_1829698	1	The unfolding case of Jose Padilla reminds us of one of the most important : mistreating a prisoner makes it hard , if not impossible , for a real court to judge whether he has committed real crimes .
2007_03_01_1829698	2	Mr. Padilla is a former Chicago gang member whose arrest in 2002 was touted by the Bush administration as the disruption of a high-level plot by Al Qaeda to set off a '' dirty bomb '' in the United States .
2007_03_01_1829698	3	Mr. Padilla was held without charge for three years and eight months in a Navy brig , his windows blackened , his every move watched .
2007_03_01_1829698	4	Then , rather than defend its actions before the Supreme Court , the White House declared a year ago that Mr. Padilla was no longer an illegal combatant , transferred him to civilian custody and filed conspiracy charges that have nothing to do with dirty bombs .
2007_03_01_1829698	5	Yesterday , Judge Marcia Cooke of the Federal District Court in Miami ruled against Mr. Padilla 's defense lawyers , who argued that his abusive confinement was so traumatic that he could not assist them in a trial .
2007_03_01_1829698	6	They had wanted to send Mr. Padilla to a hospital for treatment first .
2007_03_01_1829698	7	That still leaves the far bigger question of whether Mr. Padilla was tortured , as he has claimed .
2007_03_01_1829698	8	For there to be a trial , Judge Cooke will have to rule that Mr. Padilla was not tortured , and she made a point of saying yesterday that her ruling on his competence was not a judgment on the torture claim .
2007_03_01_1829698	9	At one point in the mental competency hearing , a prosecutor wanted to introduce what he said was a Qaeda manual instructing captured operatives to claim torture even if none had occurred .
2007_03_01_1829698	10	Judge Cooke refused , pointing out that there was no evidence that Mr. Padilla had ever heard of the manual , much less studied it .
2007_03_01_1829698	11	The government has yet to show evidence that Mr. Padilla was even a member of Al Qaeda .
2007_03_01_1829698	12	The government 's arguments at the hearing sounded ridiculous and shameful .
2007_03_01_1829698	13	Prosecutors said Mr. Padilla always seemed fine to his jailers , but it was his jailers who did things like standing on his bare feet with boots so they could shackle him .
2007_03_01_1829698	14	The brig psychologist testified that he had spoken to Mr. Padilla only twice , once when he was first detained , and two years later -- through a slit in his cell door .
2007_03_01_1829698	15	When a psychologist testified for the defense that Mr. Padilla was '' an anxiety-ridden , broken individual , '' the prosecution said her tests were invalid -- because the jailers had kept Mr. Padilla handcuffed throughout .
2007_03_01_1829698	16	We will probably never know if Mr. Padilla was a would-be terrorist .
2007_03_01_1829698	17	So far , this trial has been a reminder of how Mr. Bush 's policy on prisoners has compromised the judicial process .
2007_03_01_1829698	18	And it has confirmed the world 's suspicions of the United States ' stooping to the very behavior it once stood against .
2007_03_01_1829699	0	Much attention has been focused on the cardiovascular risks posed by Vioxx and other so-called cox-2 inhibitors in recent years , so the American Heart Association provided an important service this week by reminding us that many other painkillers have risks associated with them .
2007_03_01_1829699	1	The association spelled out gradations of cardiovascular risk and recommended a step-by-step approach -- starting with nonmedicinal remedies -- that doctors should follow when treating joint and ligament pain .
2007_03_01_1829699	2	The scientific statement applies specifically to patients who already have or are at risk of heart disease and also need relief from pain -- whether caused by short-term sprains or long-term rheumatoid arthritis .
2007_03_01_1829699	3	But the lead author believes that everyone might benefit from the same cautious approach toward pain relief .
2007_03_01_1829699	4	A lot has happened since the heart association issued a similar advisory two years ago .
2007_03_01_1829699	5	The evidence has gotten even stronger that the cox-2 inhibitors -- Celebrex is the only one left on the market in this country -- increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes .
2007_03_01_1829699	6	And new evidence has emerged that some other painkillers also increase the cardiovascular risks .
2007_03_01_1829699	7	The most striking recommendation is that pain treatments should start with nonmedicinal approaches , like physical therapy and exercise , weight loss to reduce stress on joints , and hot or cold packs .
2007_03_01_1829699	8	Only if those do n't provide enough relief should drugs be used , and the doctor should take a step-by-step approach in prescribing medications , from the safest to the riskiest .
2007_03_01_1829699	9	The first medication would usually be acetaminophen or aspirin at the lowest effective dose , or certain other low-risk drugs .
2007_03_01_1829699	10	Only if those fail should doctors progress to riskier drugs , starting with naproxen and then perhaps ibuprofen , both available over the counter .
2007_03_01_1829699	11	A cox-2 inhibitor should be prescribed only as a last resort .
2007_03_01_1829699	12	The overall message is that one should use the lowest effective dose of the safest drug for the shortest period of time .
2007_03_01_1829699	13	That is always good advice , but it tends to be forgotten in an age when drugs are so heavily promoted .
2007_03_01_1829700	0	For the past few years , the New York City Opera has been looking beyond Lincoln Center , wondering where it will make its home .
2007_03_01_1829700	1	The City Opera has named a new general manager and artistic director , Gerard Mortier -- currently director of the Paris National Opera -- who has convinced the board that the opera should stay put .
2007_03_01_1829700	2	This heralds the opening of a dynamic era for opera at Lincoln Center , a head-to-head competition between two vigorous , creative personalities : Peter Gelb , the general manager at the Metropolitan Opera , and Mr. Mortier next door at City Opera .
2007_03_01_1829700	3	Mr. Gelb has already shown that he is committed to expanding the reach of the Metropolitan Opera by bringing nonoperatic directors to its stage and by broadcasting opera to audiences in Times Square and Lincoln Center Plaza .
2007_03_01_1829700	4	Mr. Mortier has a reputation for being brash , and he is likely to take the City Opera in directions that are eye-popping in production and contemporary in repertoire .
2007_03_01_1829700	5	He will undoubtedly challenge audiences , performers and the big opera company next door .
2007_03_01_1829700	6	Mr. Mortier 's appointment is also a reminder of how hard it is to find exactly the right person for such a complex role .
2007_03_01_1829700	7	He is not noted as a fund-raiser , at least in part because in Paris he has directed an opera company that is largely state-financed , unlike the City Opera .
2007_03_01_1829700	8	And he will not take over full time at Lincoln Center for another two years .
2007_03_01_1829700	9	Until then , the City Opera will be working to extend the legacy of its current leader , Paul Kellogg , who has turned it into a company worth bequeathing to Mr. Mortier .
2007_03_01_1829700	10	What we have to look forward to is a grand new opportunity for opera in New York .

2007_03_01_1829701	9	To the Editor : You point to declining reading and math scores and assume that the problems are a result of inferior teachers .
2007_03_01_1829701	10	I do not doubt that inferior teachers share some culpability , but teachers are just one part of the equation .
2007_03_01_1829701	11	Teenagers generally spend more time with their families than with any one high school teacher , and I have seen students succeed with moderately proficient teachers because the students knew that that teacher cared about them , and they worked harder for this teacher than for other '' more qualified '' teachers .

2007_03_01_1829701	19	Have you considered distraction and exhaustion ?
2007_03_01_1829701	20	Here are some trends in today 's youth and education when compared with kids of an earlier , higher-achieving age : less discipline in the classroom ; more sexual activity with predictable drama ; easy availability of street drugs ; exploding increases in communications ( cellphones , e-mail , chat rooms , YouTube ) ; lack of free time ( overscheduled extracurricular activities , too much homework ) ; reduced family time and influence , along with bad parental example ( who has time to read ? )
2007_03_01_1829701	21	; and tension from religious , cultural , ethnic and racial differences .
2007_03_01_1829701	22	Do any of these play a role in reducing performance ?
2007_03_01_1829701	23	Or will you still blame the teachers ?
2007_03_01_1829701	24	Lon Nesseler San Diego , Feb. 27 , 2007 To the Editor : I am in full agreement that the state of public education in our country needs to change , and the most recent national report card on literacy and math skills is evidence of this need .
2007_03_01_1829701	25	But I am not in full agreement with your suggested solution .
2007_03_01_1829701	26	You imply that the reason students are n't doing well is that teachers are doing a poor job of teaching .
2007_03_01_1829701	27	Over all , teachers do the best job they can given the circumstances .
2007_03_01_1829701	28	This reality is a symptom of a system that has few incentives to bring in the best and the brightest people to prepare our youth .
2007_03_01_1829701	29	It has become increasingly difficult to teach because of the growing number of special-needs students in mainstream classes even as class resources are shrinking and class sizes are growing .
2007_03_01_1829701	30	It is quite simple : if we want test scores to improve , we need to make class sizes smaller , invest more money in education ( including lengthening the school year and student time in class ) , and provide more resources to teachers to help with increasingly diverse populations of students of various abilities and learning needs .

2007_03_01_1829701	33	You decry the '' odious practice of supplying the neediest students with the least qualified teachers . ''
2007_03_01_1829701	34	Usually , the neediest students are in inner-city schools .
2007_03_01_1829701	35	Most teachers avoid these schools for fear of their own safety .
2007_03_01_1829701	36	Why would any teacher want to be in a dangerous environment ?
2007_03_01_1829701	37	Parents and students bear some responsibility for scaring away some of the best qualified and caring teachers .

2007_03_01_1829703	0	To the Editor : Re '' Charity Group Lags in Efforts on Gulf Homes '' ( front page , Feb. 22 ) : We are proud of our work with Habitat for Humanity and its New Orleans area affiliate .
2007_03_01_1829703	1	Unable to build houses because of the conditions on the ground , the New Orleans affiliate of Habitat coordinated early-arriving volunteers to gut more than 2,000 homes hardest hit by flooding .
2007_03_01_1829703	2	To accomplish this , the affiliate had to persuade the Federal Emergency Management Agency to allow volunteers to stay in its base camps designated for first responders .
2007_03_01_1829703	3	When FEMA closed these camps last July , it was Habitat that came to the rescue by providing the money that has sustained Camp Hope , a housing site for out-of-town volunteers now known as Habitat Camp .
2007_03_01_1829703	4	When the relevant agencies came back online in 2006 and began granting housing permits , the New Orleans affiliate of Habit was among the first to act .
2007_03_01_1829703	5	After Katrina , Habitat has been granted one of every eight single-home construction permits awarded in New Orleans , easily making it not merely the area 's leading low-income home builder but the leading builder of homes of any type .
2007_03_01_1829703	6	Now that the infrastructure is in better condition , Habitat has set still greater goals of constructing hundreds of additional homes in the next five years .
2007_03_01_1829703	7	We realize that a nonprofit , primarily volunteer-driven organization can not lead the response to this cataclysmic tragedy .
2007_03_01_1829703	8	Yet given the slow overall progress in responding to Hurricanes Rita and Katrina , the relief that Habitat and its more than 25,000 volunteers have provided to poor families to date is truly heroic .

2007_03_01_1829704	0	To the Editor : Re '' Trapped on an Airplane '' ( editorial , Feb. 23 ) : It may at first blush seem that federal legislation is necessary to induce airlines to avoid the recent JetBlue and other airline debacles .
2007_03_01_1829704	1	Yet JetBlue is following some of the better crisis management practices from both a business and a political perspective : it admitted fault , offered compensation and announced steps that it would take to correct the problem .
2007_03_01_1829704	2	The harsh gaze of media scrutiny drove JetBlue to rapid action .
2007_03_01_1829704	3	It 's likely that this event and other similar airline abuses have finally caused airlines to take notice -- without federal regulation .
2007_03_01_1829704	4	And federal regulation of other aspects of aviation -- particularly safety and security -- has generally fallen short of perceived needs .
2007_03_01_1829704	5	But the recent JetBlue incident may well give fliers a reason to flex their power as consumers , and the airlines the opportunity to prove that they care about their customers .
2007_03_01_1829704	6	The fear of losing passengers appears to be a greater motivator than the fear of potential regulation .

2007_03_01_1829705	1	I ca n't imagine that after the groundbreaking collaboration between the Department of Education and New York City 's cultural community in the design of specific curriculum guidelines in all of the arts disciplines , the department would jeopardize its goal of providing academic parity to the arts for all public school students .
2007_03_01_1829705	2	Many principals give greater priority to skill-based learning in an effort to guarantee that their students achieve high grades on competitive exams ; they have never experienced or even experimented with visual arts , music , dance or drama .
2007_03_01_1829705	3	Invaluable as subjects by themselves , overall academic performance and conceptual thinking are natural byproducts of arts education .
2007_03_01_1829705	4	Project Arts was created to ensure that arts training was available to every student : the funds are not unrestricted funds to be spent to fill in other financing deficiencies .

2007_03_01_1829706	1	We complain that public education is underfinanced , and the PTAs raise money for playground equipment and classroom supplies ; that kids do n't get enough exercise , and they lobby for longer recess ; that parents are n't involved in the schools , and they serve pizza and plan innovative events .

2007_03_01_1829709	0	I ASK you , gardeners : is there some vegetable out there that eludes you , that you can not grow no matter how hard you try ?
2007_03_01_1829709	1	For me it is the leek .
2007_03_01_1829709	2	What I would give to have those mild white roots and those blue-green leaves to chop into creamy soup on a cold winter 's day .
2007_03_01_1829709	3	But I 'm doing something wrong .
2007_03_01_1829709	4	They will not grow for me .
2007_03_01_1829709	5	Every winter about this time I start the little black seeds indoors and nurse the threadlike seedlings until early spring , when I plant them in a raised bed enriched with compost .
2007_03_01_1829709	6	They seem to thrive at first , standing straight and tall , but somehow over the course of the summer -- be it weeds , a lack of water or my own evil eye -- my leeks turn to mush .
2007_03_01_1829709	7	I called Scott Chaskey , the manager of Quail Hill , a community farm in Amagansett , N.Y. , to find out his secret to growing them .
2007_03_01_1829709	8	I 've literally gone over leeks with our chisel plow and they show up weeks later , '' Mr. Chaskey said . ''
2007_03_01_1829709	9	They pop right back up , sort of sideways , growing on an angle . ''
2007_03_01_1829709	10	Same story from Leslie Rose Close , who gardens in Bridgehampton , N.Y. '' Leeks are invincible , '' she said . ''
2007_03_01_1829709	11	They 're sort of a pest in my garden . ''
2007_03_01_1829709	12	She planted them about 20 years ago . ''
2007_03_01_1829709	13	They just drop seed and I get new ones every year in the same patch , '' she said .
2007_03_01_1829709	14	Every four or five years she might transplant some seedlings to a new bed , because leeks are heavy feeders and they need rich soil to thrive .
2007_03_01_1829709	15	But she does n't ever bother to blanch them , as the books advise , by pulling up soil around their stems as they grow . ''
2007_03_01_1829709	16	I do n't have the time or the discipline , '' she said . ''
2007_03_01_1829709	17	I just use them as they are .
2007_03_01_1829709	18	There 's quite a bit of white below the surface . ''
2007_03_01_1829709	19	The ones she does n't eat just bloom . ''
2007_03_01_1829709	20	They 're gorgeous , '' she said .
2007_03_01_1829709	21	All shades of purple , or creamy white .
2007_03_01_1829709	22	And then , of course , they set seed and make more leeks .
2007_03_01_1829709	23	In her garden , that is .
2007_03_01_1829709	24	All summer she grills them ; in winter she digs them up , for soups .
2007_03_01_1829709	25	Is it the temperate climate , the sandy loam out on the East End ?
2007_03_01_1829709	26	My garden in Maryland has swings of dry heat , heavy rain , smothering humidity .
2007_03_01_1829709	27	And this heavy clay could always use more compost .
2007_03_01_1829709	28	I sent an e-mail message to Wayne Winterrowd , at North Hill , the garden he shares with Joe Eck in southern Vermont .
2007_03_01_1829709	29	Heat could n't be the problem , Mr. Winterrowd wrote back .
2007_03_01_1829709	30	After all , '' leeks were an important food crop in Egypt , '' he reasoned . ''
2007_03_01_1829709	31	So I am stumped . ''
2007_03_01_1829709	32	He shared the secrets of his soil : plenty of decomposed chicken and pig litter , and a bit of 10-10-10 sprinkled lightly around the base of the young leeks once they are established in the ground . ''
2007_03_01_1829709	33	We do not earth them up because we enjoy whole braised leeks and so do n't want the problem of sand in their leaves , '' he wrote .
2007_03_01_1829709	34	( His recipe : Brown the leeks lightly in butter ; simmer them in chicken stock until it is reduced to a syrup and the leeks are tender .
2007_03_01_1829709	35	Dust them with hard Italian cheese and set under the broiler . )
2007_03_01_1829709	36	I almost ran to Whole Foods , in the snow , to buy some , for $ 2.99 a pound .
2007_03_01_1829709	37	A lack of moisture , we both agreed , could be at the heart of my leek failure .
2007_03_01_1829709	38	Just like other members of the onion family , Mr. Winterrowd wrote , leeks '' will go into premature dormancy if they are allowed to dry out at the roots . ''
2007_03_01_1829709	39	He suggested working some damp peat moss into the bottom of the row , to retain moisture . ''
2007_03_01_1829709	40	Or , better , plant them in about an inch or two of peat slurry , made from getting the moss very wet in a plastic bucket , '' he said .
2007_03_01_1829709	41	I do n't like to use peat because , despite the peat industry 's claims , I 'm not so sure it 's renewable .
2007_03_01_1829709	42	So I could substitute fibrous , half-digested compost , Mr. Winterrowd suggested , or decomposed sods -- those chunks of lawn one digs up on occasion -- or layers of newspaper .
2007_03_01_1829709	43	Well-rotted manure would help .
2007_03_01_1829709	44	Or , of course , I could finally set up that drip irrigation system I keep talking about .
2007_03_01_1829709	45	I 've ordered seeds of Giant Musselburgh ( veseys.com ) , a Scottish variety favored by Mr. Chaskey . ''
2007_03_01_1829709	46	It 's thicker and squatter than the tall , long ones , '' he said . ''
2007_03_01_1829709	47	And the leaves are a deeper blue green . ''
2007_03_01_1829709	48	And I could n't resist a French heirloom , Blue Solaise ( cooksgarden.com ) , a hardy , large variety that overwinters in Vermont .
2007_03_01_1829709	49	Mr. Chaskey and his crew start seeds in Speedling trays , which are made of plastic foam . ''
2007_03_01_1829709	50	That sounds nonrenewable , '' he said . ''
2007_03_01_1829709	51	But these are 15 years old , and much better than black plastic . ''
2007_03_01_1829709	52	The Speedling tray he likes has 200 cells .
2007_03_01_1829709	53	Each one is three inches deep , which gives those baby leeks plenty of root space .
2007_03_01_1829709	54	By planting two seeds per cell , his crew gets 400 leeks from each tray .
2007_03_01_1829709	55	And when it 's time to plant them in the field , the seedlings are easy to separate , unlike ones grown in one big flat , which have to be ripped apart , injuring roots .
2007_03_01_1829709	56	( Speedling trays are available at groworganic.com . )
2007_03_01_1829709	57	Mr. Chaskey suggests using a dibble to make a three-inch hole for each seedling , then pressing the soil in firmly . ''
2007_03_01_1829709	58	That 's the key , '' Mr. Chaskey said . ''
2007_03_01_1829709	59	Onions , including leeks , like soil to be packed around them . ''
2007_03_01_1829709	60	Then he and his crew just hill them up as they grow .
2007_03_01_1829709	61	Other leek lovers , however , insist on keeping that hole open . ''
2007_03_01_1829709	62	I dibble about a six-inch-deep hole and take the leek by the tip of its leaf and just drop it in , '' said Rob Johnston Jr. , the founder and chairman of Johnny 's Selected Seeds , in Winslow , Me . ''
2007_03_01_1829709	63	I just leave it there .
2007_03_01_1829709	64	I do n't fill the soil in . ''
2007_03_01_1829709	65	( A fine dibble is available at johnnyseeds.com . )
2007_03_01_1829709	66	Since the plant might not be taller than the hole , you do n't want to cover its growing tip . ''
2007_03_01_1829709	67	You could take a watering can or fine mist on a hose and sprinkle them nicely , '' he said .
2007_03_01_1829709	68	Nature will do the rest , filling in the holes gradually , as it rains and as those leeks grow . ''
2007_03_01_1829709	69	They wo n't miss a beat , '' he said .
2007_03_01_1829709	70	So , maybe I 'll press the soil around some of them , and leave the other ones to Nature .
2007_03_01_1829709	71	But do n't cover that growing tip .
2007_03_01_1829709	72	Mr. Johnston , who considers leeks '' one of my basic food groups , '' likes King Richard , a long variety with green leaves , which he deems tastier than the fashionable blue types .
2007_03_01_1829709	73	And here 's how he stores them , to keep them as fresh as possible through the winter : He lifts them with a spading fork before the ground freezes and packs them in a five-gallon pail , with an inch of soil on the bottom . ''
2007_03_01_1829709	74	Leave soil on the roots , and crowd the leeks into the pail , one by one , as close together as you can , '' Mr. Johnston said .
2007_03_01_1829709	75	Keep the pail in a cold cellar . ''
2007_03_01_1829709	76	Just above freezing is best . ''
2007_03_01_1829709	77	There you have it : how to grow , store and eat the perfect leek .
2007_03_01_1829709	78	So , I 'll try again .
2007_03_01_1829709	79	But apparently I 'm not alone in my failure with a particular plant .
2007_03_01_1829709	80	Mr. Winterrowd confides that he can not grow pak choi , although his climate is theoretically perfect for it , and Mr. Johnston tells me that '' some people ca n't grow peas . ''

2007_03_01_1829714	0	A Hedge of Green and Red Q. I want to plant a holly hedge in Connecticut ( Zone 6 ) .
2007_03_01_1829714	1	Blue Princess , with Blue Prince for pollination , seems to offer the most red berries and the shiniest leaves .
2007_03_01_1829714	2	Can you suggest a source for these two or recommend something better ?
2007_03_01_1829714	3	A. For gardeners in Zones 5 and 6 , there are no better evergreen hollies than the Meserve hybrids , most of which have '' blue '' in their names to honor their dark , shiny leaves .
2007_03_01_1829714	4	Blue Princess is royal for two reasons : its abundant dark red berries and its full pyramidal shape .
2007_03_01_1829714	5	Height can be as much as 15 feet , though 8 to 10 feet is more common .
2007_03_01_1829714	6	Blue Girl grows faster but has fewer berries , and is a less bushy plant .
2007_03_01_1829714	7	Blue Prince is the Princess 's usual consort , similar in shape and size , with very dark , lustrous leaves .
2007_03_01_1829714	8	You might also consider the newer Mesan , a k a Blue Stallion .
2007_03_01_1829714	9	It grows slightly faster than Blue Prince , with no loss of shapeliness , and its leaves are a bit less spiny .
2007_03_01_1829714	10	And Mesan will pollinate Meschick , a k a Dragon Lady , as well as Blue Princess .
2007_03_01_1829714	11	The Lady is slightly less hardy than the Princess but taller , to 20 feet , and columnar , so it could make nice corners .
2007_03_01_1829714	12	No matter which of these hollies you choose , large plants from a local retailer will give you the strongest start .
2007_03_01_1829714	13	The wholesale grower Conard-Pyle , first to offer Kathleen Meserve 's handiwork ( back in the 1960s ) , has a dealer locator at conard-pyle .
2007_03_01_1829714	14	An alternative is Monrovia ( dealer locator at monrovia.com ) .
2007_03_01_1829714	15	Buds Can not Be Far Behind Q. I often see the houseplant care instruction '' Increase watering and fertilizing when new growth starts in spring . ''
2007_03_01_1829714	16	Is new growth the tiny buds at the leaf bases , or actual stems and leaves ?
2007_03_01_1829714	17	A. Sorry to be circular , but spring is when vigorous new growth starts , as early as February or late as May , depending on latitude and on the individual plant .
2007_03_01_1829714	18	And new means new .
2007_03_01_1829714	19	Buds can form in leaf axils and then stay put for many months .
2007_03_01_1829714	20	Resting plants may unfold a few leaves as they inch through the winter .
2007_03_01_1829714	21	Yet as you will soon see , the resumption of active growth is unmistakable .
2007_03_01_1829715	0	Responding to attacks by health care interests on cuts in his proposed budget , Gov. Eliot Spitzer defended his position yesterday in a television advertisement that portrayed him as someone battling the high cost of medical care in the state .
2007_03_01_1829715	1	The 30-second commercial was first shown in the New York City area last night and will be broadcast throughout the state beginning today .
2007_03_01_1829715	2	The ad comes a week after commercials by two prominent health care interests , 1199 S.E.I.U. United Healthcare Workers East , the huge health care workers ' union , and the Greater New York Hospital Association .
2007_03_01_1829715	3	In those commercials , a narrator said , '' Governor Spitzer is right to want to reform health care , but he 's doing it the wrong way . ''
2007_03_01_1829715	4	In his budget , the governor has proposed restructuring the way money is spent on Medicaid .
2007_03_01_1829715	5	During his campaign last year , he frequently complained that New York 's health care system '' was broken . ''
2007_03_01_1829715	6	And his dispute with the health care workers ' union and the hospital association represents the most contentious battle to date in Mr. Spitzer 's administration .
2007_03_01_1829715	7	Mr. Spitzer 's ad shows a maternity ward filled with crying newborns .
2007_03_01_1829715	8	A narrator says , '' In New York , we fund a health care system that rewards institutions , insurance companies and unions , not patients , giving us the most expensive Medicaid system in the country , and some of the highest rates of chronic disease . ''
2007_03_01_1829715	9	The commentary continues , saying that Mr. Spitzer 's health care plan '' puts the money where it belongs , toward bringing patient care up and disease down , making sure that every single kid born in New York will finally have medical coverage . ''
2007_03_01_1829715	10	It ends by saying that '' the only people crying about that are the usual special interests . ''
2007_03_01_1829715	11	As the narration concludes , the babies ' crying subsides .
2007_03_01_1829715	12	In a joint statement , officials from 1199 and the hospital association responded to the governor 's ad , which was paid for by Spitzer 2010 , the governor 's political Web site . ''
2007_03_01_1829715	13	Finger-pointing and name-calling will neither insure a single additional New Yorker nor improve patient care for any man , woman or child in our state , '' the statement said .
2007_03_01_1829715	14	They have contended that instead of cutting roughly $ 1 billion from hospitals and nursing homes , the governor should be looking for savings in the health maintenance organizations and drug industries .
2007_03_01_1829716	0	The police called it a high-priced brothel offering a dominatrix 's services .
2007_03_01_1829716	1	But as brothels go , the reputed one that Sandra L. Chemero is accused of operating out of her home had something else that set it apart : a ritzy ZIP code .
2007_03_01_1829716	2	Ms. Chemero , 46 , lives in a white Colonial-style house on four acres on Haines Road in Bedford Hills , in a neighborhood of multimillion-dollar homes .
2007_03_01_1829716	3	The Bedford Hills police said on Tuesday that Ms. Chemero was anything but discreet about the reputed bordello that they accused her of running in that home -- which is next to an Orthodox Jewish community center in a wooded area dotted with stately homes .
2007_03_01_1829716	4	For months , neighbors had complained of increased traffic at the house and people coming and going at all hours , the police said .
2007_03_01_1829716	5	They began to investigate in December , after they received an anonymous letter from a neighbor expressing concern about a '' business of a sexual nature '' and referring to a Web site offering a dominatrix 's services .
2007_03_01_1829716	6	Christian Menzel , Bedford 's chief of police , said that officers found pictures of whips and sexual devices and graphic images of Ms. Chemero on that site .
2007_03_01_1829716	7	The police said an undercover officer set up a meeting with Ms. Chemero at the house , and she offered to provide sexual services at a later date .
2007_03_01_1829716	8	On Tuesday , they arrested her , and said officers found a stun gun at her home .
2007_03_01_1829716	9	Ms. Chemero was charged with prostitution and weapons possession .
2007_03_01_1829716	10	She was released and is scheduled to appear in court on March 8 .
2007_03_01_1829716	11	Ms. Chemero could not be reached for comment by phone last night , and a knock at her door was not answered .
2007_03_01_1829716	12	There were purple flowers , visible through a window , neatly placed on a kitchen table .
2007_03_01_1829716	13	A bedroom is just off the entrance hall .
2007_03_01_1829716	14	Although the police said neighbors tipped them off , news of Ms. Chemero 's arrest came as a shock to some on Haines Road .
2007_03_01_1829716	15	Mary Ann Hawley , who lives across the street , said she had no idea about what the police described . ''
2007_03_01_1829716	16	I 'm appalled and I 'm shocked , '' she said . ''
2007_03_01_1829716	17	I find it hard to believe .
2007_03_01_1829716	18	But you have to understand , we do n't know our neighbors , because the houses are so far apart . ''
2007_03_01_1829717	0	Gov. Rick Perry removed the chairman of the Texas Youth Commission on Wednesday over charges that the agency covered up the sexual abuse of incarcerated juveniles .
2007_03_01_1829717	1	Mr. Perry also called for the ouster of the acting executive director , the appointment of an independent inspector general and a shake-up throughout the commission , which runs 13 schools housing 3,000 felons under age 21 . ''
2007_03_01_1829717	2	Leadership starts at the top , '' a spokesman for Mr. Perry , Ted Royer , said . ''
2007_03_01_1829717	3	And the governor believes the very top leadership has failed . ''
2007_03_01_1829717	4	Late Wednesday , the State Senate voted unanimously to demand that the governor appoint a conservator to take over the commission temporarily .
2007_03_01_1829717	5	On Tuesday , the Senate Criminal Justice Committee disclosed details of long-secret investigations by the commission and the Texas Rangers showing that two supervisors at the West Texas State School in remote Pyote routinely roused boys from their beds for sexual encounters that were reported but went unpunished by the school superintendent , who now has a top leadership position at the commission .
2007_03_01_1829717	6	The supervisors were allowed to resign without facing criminal charges , but are now under investigation .
2007_03_01_1829717	7	The dismissed chairman , Pete C. Alfaro , is a former mayor of Baytown who was first named to the commission in 1995 by Gov. George W. Bush and was appointed chairman by Mr. Perry in 2004 .
2007_03_01_1829717	8	Mr. Alfaro did not respond to messages seeking comment .
2007_03_01_1829717	9	His latest five-year term expires in August .
2007_03_01_1829717	10	Hours after the governor 's spokesman said that Mr. Alfaro had been told by phone that he was being replaced by his vice chairman , Donald R. Bethel , a spokesman for the Texas Youth Commission , Tim Savoy , said the agency had received no notice of the action .
2007_03_01_1829717	11	The board has a meeting scheduled for Tuesday .
2007_03_01_1829717	12	Mr. Perry , a Republican , also called on the board to replace the acting executive director , Neil Nichols , who is the general counsel and a 33-year veteran of the agency .
2007_03_01_1829717	13	Mr. Nichols took over last Friday upon the sudden retirement of the executive director , Dwight Harris , who started as a caseworker in 1981 .
2007_03_01_1829717	14	The governor said Ed Owens , deputy executive director of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice , had agreed to serve as the commission 's acting executive director .
2007_03_01_1829717	15	Though the governor makes appointments to the seven-member board , he has the power by himself only to remove the chairman , legal experts said .
2007_03_01_1829717	16	He can fire members upon a finding of gross fiscal mismanagement by a legislative audit committee made up of the lieutenant governor , who is the president of the Senate ; the House speaker ; and two other members from each chamber .
2007_03_01_1829717	17	Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst on Wednesday demanded sweeping changes in the commission .
2007_03_01_1829717	18	Senator John Whitmire , a Houston Democrat and chairman of the Criminal Justice Committee , said Wednesday that he had '' no confidence in the board '' but that Mr. Perry was not yet ready to seek its ouster .
2007_03_01_1829718	0	Stephen Hawking , the British cosmologist , Cambridge professor and best-selling author who has spent his career pondering the nature of gravity from a wheelchair , says he intends to get away from it all for a little while .
2007_03_01_1829718	1	On April 26 , Dr. Hawking , surrounded by a medical entourage , is to take a zero-gravity ride out of Cape Canaveral on a so-called vomit comet , a padded aircraft that flies a roller-coaster trajectory to produce periods of weightlessness .
2007_03_01_1829718	2	He is getting his lift gratis , from the Zero Gravity Corporation , which has been flying thrill seekers on a special Boeing 727-200 since 2004 at $ 3,500 a trip .
2007_03_01_1829718	3	Peter H. Diamandis , chief executive of Zero G , said that '' the idea of giving the world 's expert on gravity the opportunity to experience zero gravity '' was irresistible .
2007_03_01_1829718	4	In some ways , this is only a prelude .
2007_03_01_1829718	5	Dr. Hawking announced on his 65th birthday , in January , that he hoped to take a longer , higher flight in 2009 on a space plane being developed by Richard Branson 's company Virgin Galactic , which seeks to take six passengers to an altitude of 70 miles .
2007_03_01_1829718	6	Dr. Hawking says he wants to encourage public interest in spaceflight , which he believes is critical to the future of humanity . ''
2007_03_01_1829718	7	I also want to show , '' he said in an e-mail interview , '' that people need not be limited by physical handicaps as long as they are not disabled in spirit . ''
2007_03_01_1829718	8	Coming at a time when human spaceflight is at a crossroads , his trip into space is likely to shine a giant light on the burgeoning and hopeful industry of space tourism .
2007_03_01_1829718	9	NASA has redesigned the space program around finishing the International Space Station and sending people to the Moon again and then to Mars , much to the unhappiness of many scientists who fear that the growing costs of human flight will squeeze science out of the program .
2007_03_01_1829718	10	Some voices , including Martin Rees , Dr. Hawking 's old friend and president of the Royal Society , have been saying that space may be explored more economically and faster by private entrepreneurs , who can take risks and weather the occasional disaster without having to worry about a Congressional cancellation of financing .
2007_03_01_1829718	11	Last summer , at a news conference in Hong Kong , Dr. Hawking said humanity 's ultimate survival depended on colonizing the solar system and beyond . ''
2007_03_01_1829718	12	Life on Earth , '' he said , '' is at the ever-increasing risk of being wiped out by a disaster , such as sudden global nuclear war , a genetically engineered virus or other dangers we have not yet thought of . ''
2007_03_01_1829718	13	At an age when many of his contemporaries are thinking about retirement , Dr. Hawking seems determined to add yet another chapter to a tale of already legendary adventurousness and determination , not to mention scientific achievement .
2007_03_01_1829718	14	He was only a graduate student at Cambridge University in the 1960s when he was found to have amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , or Lou Gehrig 's disease , which usually kills its victims in two to five years .
2007_03_01_1829718	15	He persevered to get his degree and become the world 's reigning expert on black holes , the bottomless pits in which gravity has crushed dead stars , space and time out of existence .
2007_03_01_1829718	16	Along the way he has married twice , fathered three children ( he is now a grandfather ) , written the best-selling '' A Brief History of Time '' among other books , traveled the world and appeared as a guest on '' Star Trek : The Next Generation '' and '' The Simpsons . ''
2007_03_01_1829718	17	Dr. Hawking has been to the White House , the Great Wall of China and Antarctica , met the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders and been lowered into the pit of an underground particle accelerator .
2007_03_01_1829718	18	Lawrence M. Krauss , a cosmologist from Case Western Reserve University , who once took him down in a submarine , said , '' Stephen is a dreamer and an adventurer who enjoys the opportunities his celebrity brings in a way that happily perhaps compensates , although only minuscule-ly , for his physical affliction . ''
2007_03_01_1829718	19	The image of him floating through the stars in his wheelchair has become a symbol of humanity 's restless curiosity and wonder .
2007_03_01_1829718	20	Now it seems that the symbol is about to become the real thing , sans wheelchair .
2007_03_01_1829718	21	Dr. Diamandis , a space entrepreneur who is a founder of the $ 10 million Ansari X Prize , awarded in 2004 for the world 's first private spacecraft , on which the Branson craft is based , said he had offered Dr. Hawking a ride after hearing him express enthusiasm for spaceflight .
2007_03_01_1829718	22	There followed long discussions between Dr. Hawking 's doctors and the company 's to make sure that it would be safe .
2007_03_01_1829718	23	Almost completely paralyzed , and frail after decades in a wheelchair , Dr. Hawking long ago lost the power of speech and communicates with a computerized voice synthesizer that is controlled by his eye movements .
2007_03_01_1829718	24	Zero Gravity , founded in 1993 by Dr. Diamandis and Byron K. Lichtenberg , a former astronaut , has flown some 2,500 people , only 1 or 2 percent of whom , Dr. Diamandis said , have become spacesick .
2007_03_01_1829718	25	The aircraft has about 35 seats .
2007_03_01_1829718	26	Once the plane reaches some 24,000 feet , he said , the passengers leave their seats and lie in a large padded open area .
2007_03_01_1829718	27	As the plane flies its roller-coaster trajectory , they experience repeated swings between feeling heavier than normal , at the dip , and then weightless , at the peak , where they drift gently off the floor in what Dr. Diamandis , who has been on 40 or 50 such flights , described as a '' really a joyous experience , almost Zen-like , '' lasting about half a minute .
2007_03_01_1829718	28	Dr. Hawking 's flight will probably be even shorter , Dr. Diamandis said , with the pilots consulting with Dr. Hawking and his doctors after each cycle .
2007_03_01_1829718	29	In the e-mail interview , Dr. Hawking said , '' I 'm not worried about the zero gravity section , but the high-G part will be difficult . ''
2007_03_01_1829718	30	Asked what his family thought of the adventure , he replied , '' My family say ` Good on you ! ' ''
2007_03_01_1829719	0	Senator John McCain of Arizona took the platform of a late-night talk show Wednesday and said he would formally announce his campaign for the presidency in early April .
2007_03_01_1829719	1	His remarks erased entirely whatever doubt could have existed about his ambitions for the Republican nomination . ''
2007_03_01_1829719	2	The last time we were on this program -- I 'm sure you remember everything very clearly that we say -- but you asked me if I would come back on this show if I was going to announce , '' Mr. McCain told David Letterman . ''
2007_03_01_1829719	3	I am announcing that I will be a candidate for president of the United States . '' ''
2007_03_01_1829719	4	Oh , '' Mr. Letterman replied with what seemed at least a glimmer of surprise .
2007_03_01_1829719	5	Mr. McCain is known as something of a free spirit , and his aides suggested that his remarks to Mr. Letterman were , if formal-sounding , extemporaneous rather than a result of careful planning by his campaign .
2007_03_01_1829719	6	Nonetheless , aides said , his appearance clearly fit into the campaign 's effort to stir as much excitement and interest as possible in his plans -- a point Mr. McCain himself made as he and Mr. Letterman bantered on . ''
2007_03_01_1829719	7	By the way , I 'll be making a formal announcement in April , '' Mr. McCain said .
2007_03_01_1829719	8	By way of explanation , he added : '' This is the announcement preceding the formal announcement .
2007_03_01_1829719	9	You know you drag this out as long as you can .
2007_03_01_1829719	10	You do n't just have one rendition .
2007_03_01_1829719	11	You 've got to do it over and over . ''
2007_03_01_1829719	12	Acting a bit downcast , Mr. Letterman responded , '' How do you think that makes me feel ? ''
2007_03_01_1829719	13	The exchange was the latest example of how the customs of presidential campaigns are changing .
2007_03_01_1829719	14	Not all that long ago , an announcement was a defining moment in the evolution of candidates , in which they truly opened their campaigns .
2007_03_01_1829719	15	For 2008 , on the other hand , candidates have been not only announcing but also preannouncing on Web sites and various television shows and in random interviews .
2007_03_01_1829719	16	In truth , Mr. McCain has been running for the White House for nearly two years and , ever since forming a presidential exploratory committee in November , has repeatedly told interviewers that there are no circumstances he can foresee in which he would not run .
2007_03_01_1829719	17	He has assembled a full campaign staff , and his organization has been churning out nearly daily pronouncements of the latest political figure to endorse him .
2007_03_01_1829719	18	In Iowa two weeks ago , he talked at three events about what he would do as president .
2007_03_01_1829719	19	And he is going to the West Coast this weekend to raise money .
2007_03_01_1829719	20	Mr. McCain 's aides said Wednesday that they would not disclose any details about the announcement tour until later , no doubt in anticipation of drawing yet another round of publicity . ''
2007_03_01_1829719	21	Details on the formal announcement will be forthcoming , '' said Brian Jones , campaign spokesman .
2007_03_01_1829720	0	In the span of just two weeks , the United States has agreed to hold high-level contacts with Iran and Syria , and to start down the path toward formal diplomatic recognition of North Korea .
2007_03_01_1829720	1	Has the Bush administration gone soft on its foes ?
2007_03_01_1829720	2	As recently as Jan. 12 , Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice repeated what has been a constant of Bush foreign policy : a refusal to bestow on Iran , Syria and North Korea the legitimacy of diplomatic engagement as long as they refuse to bend on disputed issues . ''
2007_03_01_1829720	3	That 's not diplomacy , '' Ms. Rice said before a Senate panel , in defending the administration 's stand on Iran and Syria . ''
2007_03_01_1829720	4	That 's extortion . ''
2007_03_01_1829720	5	Administration officials insisted Wednesday that the new overtures , including an agreement to join Iran and Syria in talks on Iraq , did not mean there had been a change in policy . ''
2007_03_01_1829720	6	There is no crack , '' the White House spokesman , Tony Snow , said . ''
2007_03_01_1829720	7	A number of people have been characterizing U.S. participation in a regional meeting as a change in policy ; it is nothing of the sort . ''
2007_03_01_1829720	8	But foreign policy experts , administration critics on Capitol Hill and former diplomats disagreed , saying the administration appeared to have recognized the extent to which it had tied its own hands by insisting on talking only to friends .
2007_03_01_1829720	9	Even Ms. Rice had called the opening to Tehran and Damascus a '' diplomatic initiative . '' ''
2007_03_01_1829720	10	The question is n't whether the axis of evil is dead ; it 's alive as it was yesterday , '' said Daniel P. Serwer , a vice president at the United States Institute of Peace and a former diplomat who served as executive director of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group . ''
2007_03_01_1829720	11	The question is whether the concept , as it was applied , is dead .
2007_03_01_1829720	12	And it 's absolutely clear to me that you have to talk to who you have to talk to , in order to get things done . ''
2007_03_01_1829720	13	Within the administration , there has long been a tug of war between advocates of engagement , represented by the diplomats at the State Department and sometimes led by Ms. Rice , and those who have sought to isolate enemies , a group led by Vice President Dick Cheney and defended by the former United Nations ambassador , John R. Bolton .
2007_03_01_1829720	14	In the period leading up to the start of the Iraq war in 2003 and in the years immediately after , those pushing for isolation appeared to have the upper hand .
2007_03_01_1829720	15	But last November 's election results , along with the morass in Iraq and a yearning for some foreign-policy home runs as the clock winds down on the Bush administration , have made room for proponents of engagement .
2007_03_01_1829720	16	A senior administration official who advocates at least limited contacts with America 's enemies said , '' There was n't one big ` Aha ! '
2007_03_01_1829720	17	moment , when suddenly we were being heard . ''
2007_03_01_1829720	18	But , he said , '' there seems to be more of a recognition of the limited success '' of the approach .
2007_03_01_1829720	19	At a dinner and lecture on Tuesday night at the Library of Congress , it looked like a reunion of the pro-engagement crowd .
2007_03_01_1829720	20	Seated at the front was former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger , along with the new deputy secretary of state , John D. Negroponte ; also in attendance was Robert L. Gallucci , the former chief United States negotiator during the North Korean nuclear crisis of 1994 .
2007_03_01_1829720	21	It was a veritable bevy of advocates of realpolitik , headlined by former Secretary of State James A. Baker III , who told the audience , '' America must be prepared to talk to our enemies . ''
2007_03_01_1829720	22	Ms. Rice has come under criticism from conservative hard-liners , both in and out of the administration .
2007_03_01_1829720	23	So far , her close relationship with President Bush has allowed her to prod the administration toward more engagement , while at the same time taking pains not to push Mr. Bush further than he is willing to go , administration officials said .
2007_03_01_1829720	24	In the North Korea case , Ms. Rice pressed for United Nations Security Council sanctions after it exploded a nuclear device in October .
2007_03_01_1829720	25	Then , three months later , she telephoned Mr. Bush directly from Berlin , where she was traveling , to get his approval for the United States to pursue an accord with North Korea on nuclear issues .
2007_03_01_1829720	26	In doing so , she bypassed layers of government policy review that had derailed past efforts to negotiate an agreement , administration officials said .
2007_03_01_1829720	27	The State Department announced Wednesday that as part of the agreement , in which North Korea agreed to shut its main nuclear reactor in exchange for food and fuel aid , the United States and North Korea would hold '' working group talks '' on Monday and Tuesday on the normalization of relations .
2007_03_01_1829720	28	In the case of Iran and Syria , Ms. Rice followed a similar strategy .
2007_03_01_1829720	29	In the weeks leading up to Tuesday 's shift , she joined the rest of the Bush administration in increasingly confrontational oratory toward Iran .
2007_03_01_1829720	30	She accused Iran of aiding Shiite militias in attacks against American troops .
2007_03_01_1829720	31	She referred to '' increasing lethality '' in those attacks , which she said the United States would not stand for .
2007_03_01_1829720	32	One senior administration official said the hard line helped Ms. Rice answer critics who accused her of being too soft .
2007_03_01_1829720	33	It also allowed the United States to sit at the table with Iran and Syria from a position of strength , the official said . ''
2007_03_01_1829720	34	The government of the U.S. now feels as though it has leverage , '' another senior administration official said . ''
2007_03_01_1829720	35	People ask , ` What 's changed ? '
2007_03_01_1829720	36	That 's what 's changed . ''
2007_03_01_1829720	37	It remains unclear whether an administration that has been committed for so long to not talking to its enemies can make a sincere about-face .
2007_03_01_1829720	38	At this point , administration officials caution that they have no plans to negotiate one-on-one with Iran or Syria .
2007_03_01_1829720	39	But they said the same thing about talks with North Korea , maintaining that Washington was willing to talk to the North only within the context of six-nation talks , while American officials were actually meeting one-on-one with their North Korean counterparts .
2007_03_01_1829720	40	Still , there are not many people in the administration who believe that Vice President Cheney has suddenly changed his mind , and now favors engagement .
2007_03_01_1829720	41	That means that Ms. Rice will be under pressure to show results quickly , a tall task . ''
2007_03_01_1829720	42	You ca n't expect miracles here , '' said Lee H. Hamilton , a co-chairman , with Mr. Baker , of the Iraq Study Group , which advised the United States to engage Syria and Iran . ''
2007_03_01_1829720	43	There has to be a sustained effort , '' Mr. Hamilton said . ''
2007_03_01_1829720	44	Successful diplomacy requires very careful preparation and very extensive follow-through . ''
2007_03_01_1829721	0	Seated before a row of computer terminals flickering with stock charts in a large brokerage house in this bustling city , Li Ruichang insisted he was not too worried about Tuesday 's huge stock sell-off . ''
2007_03_01_1829721	1	Things like that happen , '' said Mr. Li , a 63-year-old engineer . ''
2007_03_01_1829721	2	But I 'm not worried about a crash .
2007_03_01_1829721	3	After a five-year-long bear market , the bull market should n't end that fast . ''
2007_03_01_1829721	4	Mr. Li , a self-professed speculator , said the Chinese stock market was like a giant government-regulated '' slot machine . ''
2007_03_01_1829721	5	Little did Mr. Li know how this regulated '' slot machine '' of a market , which fell nearly 9 percent Tuesday , set off a global sell-off in stocks .
2007_03_01_1829721	6	It recovered a substantial amount of those losses on Wednesday .
2007_03_01_1829721	7	Most international markets traded off sharply Wednesday for a second day , with losses of 2 percent or more on many major Asian exchanges and 1 percent declines common in Europe .
2007_03_01_1829721	8	But the New York Stock Exchange began advancing from the opening bell at 9:30 a.m. ; the Dow Jones industrial index closed 0.43 percent higher at 12,268.63 .
2007_03_01_1829721	9	China indirectly reassured its markets Wednesday , with its state-controlled media reporting that the government might allow greater foreign investment in Chinese stocks -- up to 10 percent of the market -- and would not impose capital gains taxes on stocks soon .
2007_03_01_1829721	10	But while China 's markets rebounded , markets around Asia fell in reaction to the sharp drop on Wall Street and to disappointing figures on the American economy .
2007_03_01_1829721	11	Investors here say there is no clear explanation for the plunge in the benchmark Shanghai composite index , which fell 8.8 percent on Tuesday , or for that matter Wednesday 's partial recovery .
2007_03_01_1829721	12	The index gained 3.9 percent to end at 2,881.07 , about 100 points above where it was at the start of February .
2007_03_01_1829721	13	It is still up about 120 percent from a year ago . ''
2007_03_01_1829721	14	Yesterday was very normal , '' said Wu Xiaowei , a 50-year-old who calls himself a professional investor . ''
2007_03_01_1829721	15	It 's a rule that in a bullish market the stock index always falls fast in an adjustment period . ''
2007_03_01_1829721	16	[ On Thurday , markets in Shanghai opened lower on concerns that stocks were too costly .
2007_03_01_1829721	17	In Tokyo , the Nikkei dropped more than 1.5 pecent as investors continued to be worried about the United States economy . ]
2007_03_01_1829721	18	Some investors blamed rumors about new government taxes for Tuesday 's steep market decline ; others called it profit taking ; and still others said many investors had celebrated too much on the first day of trading after the Chinese New Year by bidding shares up to record highs on Monday .
2007_03_01_1829721	19	The managing director general of the Asian Development Bank , Rajat M. Nag , said in an interview in Hong Kong on Wednesday morning that the fundamentals of most Asian economies remained strong .
2007_03_01_1829721	20	But he cautioned that the region remained dependent on exports to markets , especially the United States , where growth prospects were cloudy .
2007_03_01_1829721	21	China is among the most dependent of all , he said , with international trade in goods equal to 65 percent of its economic output last year . ''
2007_03_01_1829721	22	We are still fairly bullish on the Chinese economy 's growth potential , '' Mr. Nag said , but its dependence on exports '' is a vulnerability . ''
2007_03_01_1829721	23	One reason is that China has managed its currency , the yuan , limiting its rise against the dollar to keep exports strong .
2007_03_01_1829721	24	In doing so , Chinese officials may have indirectly helped create what some experts say are speculative bubbles in China 's stock and real estate markets .
2007_03_01_1829721	25	The government has bought dollars from exporters and foreign investors on a huge scale , issuing hundreds of billions of yuan notes to pay for them -- currency that otherwise might not have entered circulation .
2007_03_01_1829721	26	The government has tried to contain the potential inflationary effect of issuing so much currency by having banks and individuals buy government bonds , then effectively tearing up the yuan notes .
2007_03_01_1829721	27	Since not all the yuan can be clawed back this way , many of them end up in the stock and property markets instead , driving up prices .
2007_03_01_1829721	28	This excess of cash helps feed a bullish attitude toward the economy held by many Chinese individual investors , who still keep much of their money in bank accounts and saw Wednesday as a buying opportunity . ''
2007_03_01_1829721	29	I lost some money yesterday , but this morning I gained some , '' said Qin Changhai , a 37-year-old shoe salesman turned day trader . ''
2007_03_01_1829721	30	You see , this is what we go through every day . ''
2007_03_01_1829721	31	Other Asian markets initially turned their backs on the recovery in China 's markets .
2007_03_01_1829721	32	Instead , Asian investors reacted to potential weaknesses in the American economy .
2007_03_01_1829721	33	Shares of Asian companies that export to the United States , like Toyota , suffered heavy losses Wednesday after the Commerce Department 's report that orders for durable goods fell 7.8 percent in January . ''
2007_03_01_1829721	34	There is a worry that U.S. consumption could slow substantially , and that is a much bigger factor than China 's stock market , '' the chief Asia economist in the Hong Kong offices of Credit Suisse , Tao Dong , said .
2007_03_01_1829721	35	On top of concerns about a slump in American demand , analysts said the prospect of cuts in interest rates by the Federal Reserve to head off such a slump was also worrisome .
2007_03_01_1829721	36	Many investors in Japan appeared to be watching for signs of whether the sell-off would continue in New York . ''
2007_03_01_1829721	37	What comes next here really depends on New York , not Shanghai , '' said Eiji Kinouchi , chief technical analyst at the research arm of Daiwa Securities in Tokyo .
2007_03_01_1829721	38	The worst performer in Asia on Wednesday was the Philippine market , which fell nearly 8 percent .
2007_03_01_1829721	39	The broad extent of the decline in Asia underlined the region 's deepening connection to global financial markets and growing reliance on exports to the industrialized world . ''
2007_03_01_1829721	40	Every morning , most traders will get a fix on how the Asian markets are trading and how did the Nasdaq close -- I think people have gotten more globalized , '' said Sandeep Nanda , head of research at Sharekhan , a large retail brokerage firm in India .
2007_03_01_1829721	41	Tim Condon , the head of financial markets research at ING Financial Markets in Singapore , said that the most significant feature of the worldwide drop was that it was the first such global shock to financial markets to emerge from mainland China .
2007_03_01_1829721	42	In Japan , one of the biggest fears for investors is the possibility of rate cuts by the Federal Reserve , which could start narrowing the gap with Japan 's rock-bottom rates .
2007_03_01_1829721	43	Japanese overnight lending rates are 0.5 percent , compared with 5.25 percent in the United States .
2007_03_01_1829721	44	If the gap shrinks , it could slow or halt the so-called yen carry trade , in which investors borrow hundreds of billions of dollars ' worth of yen to invest in stock markets around the world in search of higher returns .
2007_03_01_1829721	45	If this flow of money stops , or reverses , it could prompt larger sell-offs on Wall Street and drive the yen even higher , hurting Japanese exporters even more , analysts said . ''
2007_03_01_1829721	46	Bernanke holds the trigger , '' said Kiichi Fujita , a strategist in Tokyo for Nomura Securities , referring to the Fed 's chairman , Ben S. Bernanke . ''
2007_03_01_1829721	47	If he cuts interest rates in America , the worry is that the yen carry trade will unwind . ''
2007_03_01_1829721	48	Back in China , though , state-controlled newspapers put on a positive spin Wednesday , reporting that more than 188,000 stock market accounts were opened .
2007_03_01_1829721	49	In the English-language Shanghai Daily , news of the stock slide was placed , perhaps somewhat deliberately , on Page 2 .
2007_03_01_1829721	50	After shares collapsed in 1996 , the government put in circuit breakers that restricted the market from falling more than 10 percent in a single session .
2007_03_01_1829721	51	Worried about a stock market bubble , government officials recently warned investors about '' blind optimism '' in the stock market . ''
2007_03_01_1829721	52	The government does n't want to see this go up or down too quickly , '' said Frank M. Song , director of the Center for China Financial Research at the University of Hong Kong . ''
2007_03_01_1829721	53	Their goal is to try to maintain stable growth . ''
2007_03_01_1829721	54	Stability seemed to rule again Wednesday at the Liaoning Securities brokerage house , where retirees lounged around , their feet up on the tables , watching the market go up .
2007_03_01_1829721	55	Ji Manli , watching a computer screen , said she had done '' pretty well . ''
2007_03_01_1829721	56	Her return was 300 percent . ''
2007_03_01_1829721	57	But I still think I did n't do well enough , '' said Ms. Ji , 67 , a retired electrical engineer . ''
2007_03_01_1829721	58	When some stocks hit their highs , I sold them .
2007_03_01_1829721	59	Other people did much better . ''
2007_03_01_1829722	0	Last October , the North Koreans tested their first nuclear device , the fruition of decades of work to make a weapon out of plutonium .
2007_03_01_1829722	1	For nearly five years , though , the Bush administration , based on intelligence estimates , has accused North Korea of also pursuing a secret , parallel path to a bomb , using enriched uranium .
2007_03_01_1829722	2	That accusation , first leveled in the fall of 2002 , resulted in the rupture of an already tense relationship : The United States cut off oil supplies , and the North Koreans responded by throwing out international inspectors , building up their plutonium arsenal and , ultimately , producing that first plutonium bomb .
2007_03_01_1829722	3	But now , American intelligence officials are publicly softening their position , admitting to doubts about how much progress the uranium enrichment program has actually made .
2007_03_01_1829722	4	The result has been new questions about the Bush administration 's decision to confront North Korea in 2002 . ''
2007_03_01_1829722	5	The question now is whether we would be in the position of having to get the North Koreans to give up a sizable arsenal if this had been handled differently , '' a senior administration official said this week .
2007_03_01_1829722	6	The disclosure underscores broader questions about the ability of intelligence agencies to discern the precise status of foreign weapons programs .
2007_03_01_1829722	7	The original assessment about North Korea came during the same period that the administration was building its case about Iraq 's unconventional weapons programs , which turned out to be based on flawed intelligence .
2007_03_01_1829722	8	And the new North Korea assessment comes amid debate over intelligence about Iran 's weapons .
2007_03_01_1829722	9	The public revelation of the intelligence agencies ' doubts , which have been brewing for some time , came almost by happenstance .
2007_03_01_1829722	10	In a little-noticed exchange on Tuesday at a hearing at the Senate Armed Services Committee , Joseph DeTrani , a longtime intelligence official , told Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island that '' we still have confidence that the program is in existence -- at the mid-confidence level . ''
2007_03_01_1829722	11	Under the intelligence agencies ' own definitions , that level '' means the information is interpreted in various ways , we have alternative views '' or it is not fully corroborated . ''
2007_03_01_1829722	12	The administration appears to have made a very costly decision that has resulted in a fourfold increase in the nuclear weapons of North Korea , '' Senator Reed said in an interview on Wednesday . ''
2007_03_01_1829722	13	If that was based in part on mixing up North Korea 's ambitions with their accomplishments , it 's important . ''
2007_03_01_1829722	14	Two administration officials , who declined to be identified , suggested that if the administration harbored the same doubts in 2002 that it harbored now , the negotiating strategy for dealing with North Korea might have been different -- and the tit-for-tat actions that led to October 's nuclear test could , conceivably , have been avoided .
2007_03_01_1829722	15	The strongest evidence for the original assessment was Pakistan 's sale to North Korea of upwards of 20 centrifuges , machines that spin fast to convert uranium gas into highly enriched uranium , a main fuel for atom bombs .
2007_03_01_1829722	16	Officials feared that the North Koreans would use those centrifuges as models to build a vast enrichment complex .
2007_03_01_1829722	17	But in interviews this week , experts inside and outside the government said that since then , little or no evidence of Korean procurements had emerged to back up those fears .
2007_03_01_1829722	18	The continuing doubts prompted the Office of the Director of National Intelligence on Wednesday to declassify a portion of the most recent , one-page update circulated to top national security officials about the status of North Korea 's uranium program .
2007_03_01_1829722	19	The assessment , read by two senior intelligence officials , speaking on the condition of anonymity in a joint interview , said the intelligence community still had '' high confidence that North Korea has pursued a uranium enrichment capability , which we assess is for a weapon . ''
2007_03_01_1829722	20	It added , they said , that all the government 's intelligence agencies '' judge -- most with moderate confidence -- that this effort continues .
2007_03_01_1829722	21	The degree of progress towards producing enriched uranium remains unknown , however . ''
2007_03_01_1829722	22	In other words , while the agencies were certain of the initial purchases , confidence in the program 's overall existence appears to have dropped over the years -- apparently from high to moderate .
2007_03_01_1829722	23	It is unclear why the new assessment is being disclosed now .
2007_03_01_1829722	24	But some officials suggested that the timing could be linked to North Korea 's recent agreement to reopen its doors to international arms inspectors .
2007_03_01_1829722	25	As a result , these officials have said , the intelligence agencies are facing the possibility that their assessments will once again be compared to what is actually found on the ground . ''
2007_03_01_1829722	26	This may be preventative , '' one American diplomat said .
2007_03_01_1829722	27	American intelligence agencies had long known of North Korea 's nuclear program employing plutonium , which can make compact weapons but requires large , easily detected reactors .
2007_03_01_1829722	28	By contrast , uranium warheads tend to be larger , but the technology for enriching uranium is much smaller and easier to hide .
2007_03_01_1829722	29	Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and the national security adviser , Stephen J. Hadley , declined to discuss the decisions to confront North Korea in 2002 or the quality of the intelligence behind that decision , though both have noted previously that North Korea purchased equipment from Pakistan that could only have been intended for use in producing weapons fuel .
2007_03_01_1829722	30	One former official said that it was Ms. Rice , in a meeting at the C.I.A. in 2004 , who encouraged intelligence officials to soften their assessments of how quickly the North Koreans could produce weapons-usable uranium . ''
2007_03_01_1829722	31	She asked , how did we know about the timing , and they did n't have answers , '' said the former official . ''
2007_03_01_1829722	32	Did they have Russians and Chinese helping them ?
2007_03_01_1829722	33	No one was sure .
2007_03_01_1829722	34	It was really a guesstimate about timing . ''
2007_03_01_1829722	35	Different players in the 2002 debate have different memories .
2007_03_01_1829722	36	John R. Bolton , the former American ambassador to the United Nations , who headed the State Department 's proliferation office at the time of the 2002 declaration , said in an interview on Wednesday evening that '' there was no dissent at the time , because in the face of the evidence the disputes evaporated . ''
2007_03_01_1829722	37	Mr. Bolton , one of the most hawkish voices in the administration and a vocal critic of its recent deal with North Korea , recalled that even the State Department 's own intelligence arm , which was the most skeptical of the Iraq evidence , '' agreed with the consensus opinion . ''
2007_03_01_1829722	38	But David A. Kay , a nuclear expert and former official who in 2003 and 2004 led the American hunt for unconventional arms in Iraq , said he had found the administration 's claims about the North Korean uranium program unpersuasive . ''
2007_03_01_1829722	39	They were driving it way further than the evidence indicated it should go , '' he said in an interview .
2007_03_01_1829722	40	The leap of logic , Dr. Kay added , turned evidence of equipment purchases into '' a significant production capability . ''
2007_03_01_1829722	41	But the doubts were on full display on Wednesday , when Christopher R. Hill , the chief American negotiator with North Korea , testified on Capitol Hill . ''
2007_03_01_1829722	42	If we determine that there is a program , it 's got to go , '' Mr. Hill said , words that were far more tentative than American policy makers have used about the program in the past .
2007_03_01_1829722	43	Expressing his resolve to get to the bottom of the mystery , he added : '' We can not have a situation where we -- you know , they pretend to disarm and we pretend to believe them .
2007_03_01_1829722	44	We need to run this into theground . ''
2007_03_01_1829722	45	He said that while there was no doubt that North Korea had bought centrifuges from Abdul Qadeer Khan , the rogue Pakistani engineer , there was doubt about '' how far they 've gotten . ''
2007_03_01_1829722	46	John E. McLaughlin , a former director of central intelligence and the deputy C.I.A. director in 2002 , defended the initial North Korean findings as accurate . ''
2007_03_01_1829722	47	At the time we reported this , we had confidence that they were acquiring materials that could give them the capability to do this down the road , '' he said in an interview .
2007_03_01_1829722	48	But no one , he added , '' said they had anything up and running .
2007_03_01_1829722	49	We also made clear that we did not have a confident understanding of how far along they were . ''
2007_03_01_1829722	50	That confidence has dropped further because inspectors have been banned from North Korea for four years , nearly as long as they were out of Iraq before their readmittance just before the 2003 invasion .
2007_03_01_1829722	51	In Iraq 's case , intelligence analysts extrapolated from the last information they had to assess what kind of weapons Iraq might be producing .
2007_03_01_1829722	52	Outside experts , including David Albright , president of the Institute for Science and International Security , a private group in Washington that tracks nuclear arms , have suggested in recent days that something similar happened in North Korea 's case . ''
2007_03_01_1829722	53	The evidence does n't support the extrapolation '' to the judgment that North Korea was making crucial strides in its uranium program , Mr. Albright said in an interview . ''
2007_03_01_1829722	54	The extrapolation went too far . ''
2007_03_01_1829722	55	He said administration analysts were right in thinking that Dr. Khan had sold North Korea about 20 centrifuges .
2007_03_01_1829722	56	Gen. Pervez Musharraf , the Pakistani president , confirmed that in a memoir published last year .
2007_03_01_1829722	57	But , Mr. Albright said , intelligence agencies overstated whether North Korea had used those few machines as models to construct row upon row of carbon copies .
2007_03_01_1829722	58	His report zeroed in on thousands of aluminum tubes that the North Koreans bought and tried to buy in the early 2000s .
2007_03_01_1829722	59	The C.I.A. and the Bush administration , the report said , pointed to these tubes as the '' smoking gun '' for construction of a large-scale North Korean plant for the enriching of uranium .
2007_03_01_1829722	60	It was assessments about the purpose of aluminum tubes that were at the center of the flawed Iraq intelligence .
2007_03_01_1829722	61	In the North Korea case , intelligence analysts saw the tubes as ideal for centrifuges .
2007_03_01_1829722	62	But Mr. Albright said the relatively weak aluminum tubes were suitable only for stationary outer casings -- not central rotors , which have to be very strong to keep from flying apart while spinning at tremendous speeds .
2007_03_01_1829722	63	Moreover , he added , the aluminum tubes were '' very easy to get and not controlled '' by global export authorities because of their potentially harmless nature .
2007_03_01_1829722	64	So that purchase , by itself , Mr. Albright added , was '' not an indicator '' of clandestine use for nuclear arms .
2007_03_01_1829723	0	The City Council passed a comprehensive bill yesterday to regulate New York City 's freewheeling pedicab industry for the first time , bringing to it a level of oversight similar to that imposed on taxis and tour buses .
2007_03_01_1829723	1	The bill passed 38-7 over the objections of pedicab drivers , who say the regulations go too far .
2007_03_01_1829723	2	The bill caps the number of pedicabs that can be operated in the city at 325 , bans the use of electric motors some drivers use to help in pedaling , and requires that operators carry liability insurance at a level similar to taxi owners ' .
2007_03_01_1829723	3	Currently , about half of pedicab operators are without insurance , Council officials say .
2007_03_01_1829723	4	The bill also requires that drivers be licensed and that the vehicles undergo inspections .
2007_03_01_1829723	5	Another significant feature of the bill allows the police to close off a large chunk of Midtown , where pedicabs proliferate , from Nov. 12 through Jan. 7 .
2007_03_01_1829723	6	The police can also restrict the pedicabs from other areas , at other times of year , for up to 14 days , if there is '' unusual , heavy pedestrian or vehicular traffic '' or events like parades .
2007_03_01_1829723	7	Pedicab drivers say the provisions give the police a blank check to ban them from Midtown , where most of their business is .
2007_03_01_1829723	8	The industry also objects to the cap , which it says will remove from the streets about 175 pedicabs currently operating , and to the restriction on electric motors .
2007_03_01_1829723	9	Chad Marlow , who represents the New York City Pedicab Owners Association , said the association agrees with much of the legislation , but plans to file a lawsuit challenging some elements of it .
2007_03_01_1829723	10	He said it believes that the Council was within its rights to impose a cap as the city does with taxis , but that the restriction on electric motors and the provision giving the police the power to ban pedicabs from Midtown run afoul of the law .
2007_03_01_1829723	11	Four council members abstained from yesterday 's vote , raising objections to the restriction against electric motors .
2007_03_01_1829723	12	At a council hearing before yesterday 's vote , Councilman Alan J. Gerson , who supported the original legislation but removed his name from the current version of the bill , said , '' They 're nonpolluting , they 're quiet ; why should the city care if they are electric assist or not ? ''
2007_03_01_1829723	13	But Councilman Leroy G. Comrie Jr. of Queens , one of the bill 's sponsors , said that under state law , the use of electric motors would cause the pedicabs to be classified as motorized vehicles .
2007_03_01_1829723	14	As such , they could not be registered because they lack the safety features required of cars and trucks .
2007_03_01_1829723	15	The bill requires the Department of Consumer Affairs and the New York Police Department to issue a report on the bill 's effectiveness in 18 months .
2007_03_01_1829723	16	If Michael R. Bloomberg signs the bill , as he is expected to do , the ban on electric motors will take effect immediately .
2007_03_01_1829723	17	Most of the remaining measures would go into effect about five months later .
2007_03_01_1829723	18	The area that could be closed off to pedicab drivers for up to two months is bounded on the north by 59th Street , on the south by 39th Street , on the east by Lexington Avenue and on the west by Eighth Avenue .
2007_03_01_1829723	19	That area includes the theater district .
2007_03_01_1829723	20	Being barred from there during the holidays , pedicab drivers say , would substantially cut their annual income . ''
2007_03_01_1829723	21	The best two months of the year they can take us off the streets , '' said Zlatan Davitkov , 55 , of Brooklyn , who drives a pedicab and rents out three others . ''
2007_03_01_1829723	22	Do n't they realize we need to pay our rent ? ''
2007_03_01_1829723	23	Pedicab operators say the claim that they cause congestion is exaggerated .
2007_03_01_1829723	24	They say the relatively small size and maneuverability of the pedicabs offer riders a way to skirt Manhattan traffic .
2007_03_01_1829723	25	And in the 11 years or so that the industry has operated in the city , there have been no fatal accidents involving a pedicab , the city 's Department of Consumer Affairs has said .
2007_03_01_1829723	26	But a collision on Dec. 19 , 2001 , with a private bus left a pedicab passenger with a severe shoulder injury .
2007_03_01_1829723	27	The accident resulted in a $ 2 million settlement , $ 100,000 of it paid by the pedicab company .
2007_03_01_1829723	28	Drivers of horse-drawn carriages and taxicabs have been calling for a crackdown on the unlicensed three-wheelers since they began appearing on city streets .
2007_03_01_1829723	29	Hackney and taxi operators say the pedicab drivers cut into their business without being bound by the same licensing , safety and insurance requirements as they are .
2007_03_01_1829723	30	Theater and hotel owners also lobbied for the bill . ''
2007_03_01_1829723	31	There is a lot of sentiment to remove the pedicabs altogether , '' Councilman Comrie said . ''
2007_03_01_1829723	32	People felt it was unfair they were being unregulated . ''
2007_03_01_1829723	33	Michael Woloz , who represents the Metropolitan Taxicab Board of Trade , called the legislation long overdue .
2007_03_01_1829723	34	The taxi industry , he said , had hoped the rules would go further by restricting pedicabs from picking up people who hail cabs .
2007_03_01_1829723	35	Taxi owners say their licenses give them exclusive rights to pick them up . ''
2007_03_01_1829723	36	There are certain issues that are n't quite addressed , '' Mr. Woloz said , '' but I think the legislation takes a very good step toward regulating an industry that had really grown wildly out of control . ''
2007_03_01_1829723	37	Mr. Comrie said it was the pedicab industry itself that initially sought regulation , seeking to help operators obtain insurance at group rates .
2007_03_01_1829723	38	Mr. Marlow , of the pedicab owners association , says the industry did want regulations , not for insurance purposes , but to force out irresponsible drivers .
2007_03_01_1829723	39	But he said that in the two years the proposal was being considered , the regulations have expanded and now threaten the industry 's ability to operate properly .
2007_03_01_1829723	40	Pedicab drivers -- many of them students , actors or recent immigrants -- typically charge $ 1 a minute , though they may charge more for passengers carrying extra weight .
2007_03_01_1829723	41	Charges are usually negotiated before the ride .
2007_03_01_1829723	42	The bill would require pedicab riders to post fare information prominently .
2007_03_01_1829723	43	Many of the drivers also act as impromptu tour guides , pointing out city landmarks and giving tidbits of history . ''
2007_03_01_1829723	44	It 's a very , very hard job , '' said Kader Dao , 27 , a pedicab driver from Brooklyn . ''
2007_03_01_1829723	45	The only reason you do n't get so tired is because you talk to your customers , and that 's what keeps you motivated .
2007_03_01_1829723	46	That 's why we love doing it . ''
2007_03_01_1829724	0	New York is poised to join more than a dozen states that continue to detain sex offenders after they have finished serving their prison sentences , under an agreement reached this week by Gov. Eliot Spitzer and the State Legislature .
2007_03_01_1829724	1	The agreement , which officials said they expected to announce on Thursday , will bring an end to several years of agonizing debates that pitted victims ' rights groups that argued that such laws were needed to protect the public from sex offenders against civil libertarians who were troubled that the state could confine people after their sentences were served .
2007_03_01_1829724	2	The new legislation will call for having mental health experts identify sex offenders in prison who they believe pose a risk of committing new crimes upon their release , several state officials who were briefed on the agreement said .
2007_03_01_1829724	3	Those offenders would be tried before a jury , and if the jury decided that they posed a threat , a judge would sentence them to further confinement or would release them under strict supervision .
2007_03_01_1829724	4	The state officials were granted anonymity to describe the bill because the formal announcement had not yet been made .
2007_03_01_1829724	5	Members of the Legislature were briefed on the agreement that their leaders made with the governor , and an announcement of the agreement was scheduled for Thursday morning in the Capitol . ''
2007_03_01_1829724	6	I think we are in agreement or very , very close to agreement , '' State Senator Joseph L. Bruno , the Republican majority leader , said Wednesday afternoon . ''
2007_03_01_1829724	7	And that , again , is a tremendous result on behalf of the people of this state . ''
2007_03_01_1829724	8	Such civil confinement legislation was long championed by the Republican-led Senate and by the former governor , George E. Pataki , a Republican , but it met with resistance in the Democratic-led Assembly , which raised concerns about civil liberties .
2007_03_01_1829724	9	For several years , it became a hot-button political issue , with the Republicans accusing the Democrats who opposed it of being soft on crime .
2007_03_01_1829724	10	Governor Pataki , who failed to get a civil confinement bill passed , started using the state 's mental hygiene laws to detain sex offenders in psychiatric hospitals after their prison terms ended , a practice that the Court of Appeals struck down in November .
2007_03_01_1829724	11	The mechanics of instituting civil confinement were complex .
2007_03_01_1829724	12	Some mental health professionals , who would be asked to screen sex offenders and supervise them in confinement , complained that it was a waste of scarce resources to combat mental illness .
2007_03_01_1829724	13	They warned that some states with similar laws almost never released offenders once they were civilly confined , raising questions about their rehabilitation efforts .
2007_03_01_1829724	14	Governor Spitzer , a Democrat who campaigned in support of such legislation , helped persuade the Assembly to reach an agreement , several officials said .
2007_03_01_1829724	15	Governor Spitzer made the bill a priority , calling for it recently in his first annual address to the Legislature .
2007_03_01_1829724	16	And his budget proposal called for the addition of 335 state workers to handle civil confinement efforts , the largest staff increase he has proposed .
2007_03_01_1829724	17	The agreement calls for the creation of a new state office of sex offender management , an official briefed on the agreement said .
2007_03_01_1829724	18	It calls for greater supervision of sex offenders once they are paroled , and would create a new class of crime , a sexually motivated felony , in which prosecutors could try to prove that someone intended to commit a sex crime , even if such a crime was not actually committed , the official said .
2007_03_01_1829724	19	Some groups worry about the passage of the new law . ''
2007_03_01_1829724	20	I think it 's a poor piece of public policy , and wo n't make things better in terms of crime prevention , '' said JoAnne Page , the chief executive of the Fortune Society , an advocacy group that promotes rehabilitation and alternatives to incarceration .
2007_03_01_1829724	21	She questioned the ability of a state to predict who will commit a new crime .
2007_03_01_1829724	22	But the agreement was hailed as a breakthrough in the Capitol .
2007_03_01_1829724	23	Assemblyman Ron Canestrari , the Democratic majority leader , said he was pleased that the governor , the Assembly and the Senate were continuing to reach agreements on new bills even as they battled one another politically . ''
2007_03_01_1829724	24	I 'm pleased with the outcome , and it 's another success of this legislative session , '' he said .
2007_03_01_1829724	25	Asked if the agreement was closer to the version proposed by the Assembly or the version proposed by the Senate , he said : '' It 's a mix .
2007_03_01_1829724	26	Maybe the fact that we 're all not totally satisfied with it is proof that it 's a real compromise . ''
2007_03_01_1829725	0	Warning that the proliferation of illegal immigrants is threatening the basic harmony and quality of life in the suburbs of Long Island , the Suffolk County executive , Steve Levy , outlined a list of initiatives on Wednesday to limit the influx , including a crackdown on day laborers and contractors and the assignment of federal immigration officials to the county jail .
2007_03_01_1829725	1	Flanked by other politicians and law enforcement officials , Mr. Levy charged that illegal immigrants were hurting the county 's economy by driving down wages '' that would otherwise be paid to legal residents , immigrants or not . ''
2007_03_01_1829725	2	Illegal immigrants , he said , are driving up costs for schools , hospitals , jails , courts and the police , and Suffolk taxpayers are '' unnecessarily footing the bill . ''
2007_03_01_1829725	3	News of the initiatives brought an immediate outcry from immigrant advocacy groups and Hispanic leaders , who have said that Mr. Levy 's stance smacks of bigotry .
2007_03_01_1829725	4	With the illegal immigration issue increasingly playing out in suburban settings , Mr. Levy , a co-founder of a national coalition called Mayors and Executives for Immigration Reform , has attracted a national spotlight because of his hard-line stance on the subject .
2007_03_01_1829725	5	He insists that the federal government has failed to address the problems of illegal immigration or to stem the flow of undocumented immigrants , and that local governments must take up the slack .
2007_03_01_1829725	6	Mr. Levy said that after two years of discussion , he had persuaded federal immigration officials to assign four enforcement officers to work full time in the county jail system to deal with inmates who are in the United States illegally .
2007_03_01_1829725	7	He said that anti-loitering legislation to prohibit traffic obstruction would help clear day laborers off the roadsides and street corners .
2007_03_01_1829725	8	In addition , he said there would be a seminar on March 14 at which county officials would explain to business owners a county law enacted in October that requires companies contracting with Suffolk County to verify that their employees are in the country legally , a move that he said would affect more than 6,000 companies and agencies .
2007_03_01_1829725	9	He said the policy of having county police officers look into the legal residency of anyone arrested and having them check the names against a federal database of illegal immigrants resulted in a dramatic increase in the number of illegal immigrants turned over for deportation .
2007_03_01_1829725	10	The aim of all these measures , he said , is to protect residents who '' do not want to see their neighborhood turned upside down . ''
2007_03_01_1829725	11	He estimated that of the 1.5 million people living in the county , 40,000 were illegal immigrants .
2007_03_01_1829725	12	Saying that federal immigration policy failed to address illegal immigration , he added , '' We 're trying to chip away at the problem '' by creating local legislation . ''
2007_03_01_1829725	13	There 's frustration on the local level regarding our nation 's broken borders , '' Mr. Levy said , calling the county initiatives an attempt to '' blaze the trail '' against widespread immigration problems .
2007_03_01_1829725	14	Jack Eddington , a Democratic county legislator and a co-sponsor of the anti-loitering legislation , told reporters that the problems of rising taxes and illegal immigration were '' two sides of the same coin , '' and warned illegal immigrants , '' You better beware . '' ''
2007_03_01_1829725	15	If you 're here in Suffolk County illegally , you will not stay here , '' Mr. Eddington said . ''
2007_03_01_1829725	16	If you are on the street looking for work and causing unsafe conditions , you will not stay .
2007_03_01_1829725	17	Suffolk County residents will not be victimized anymore . ''
2007_03_01_1829725	18	Another co-sponsor , Joseph T. Caracappa , Republican of Selden , said that taxpayers had '' had enough '' and that people had begun to move out of the county . ''
2007_03_01_1829725	19	Go down your block and see all the For Sale signs , '' he said .
2007_03_01_1829725	20	Mr. Levy said that in 2004 , the police informed federal authorities about 44 people who seemed to lack legal residency .
2007_03_01_1829725	21	In 2005 , the number increased to 1,063 .
2007_03_01_1829725	22	In 2006 , it rose to 2,287 .
2007_03_01_1829725	23	Sheriff Vincent DeMarco outlined the county 's new Criminal Alien Program , which would give federal immigration officials '' access to our jail management system . ''
2007_03_01_1829725	24	He said that roughly 10 percent of the 1,764 inmates in the county jail system seemed to be in the country illegally .
2007_03_01_1829725	25	Most of them are supposed to be turned over to federal authorities , he said , but in the meantime must be kept in county jails , costing the county $ 200 a day for each one . ''
2007_03_01_1829725	26	We want them out of county jails and into federal prisons ASAP , '' he said .
2007_03_01_1829725	27	The sheriff said that when people were arrested who could not show any legal residency status , '' the majority of them admit how they got in , believe it or not . ''
2007_03_01_1829725	28	Currently , federal immigration authorities must visit the jail to interview and pick up immigrants , but often the lag in waiting times allows some inmates to be bailed out or '' slip through the cracks , '' Mr. Levy said .
2007_03_01_1829725	29	Having officials assigned to the jail would make the process more efficient , he said .
2007_03_01_1829725	30	Mr. Levy has been accused by Latino leaders and immigrant advocates of failing to reach out to Spanish-speaking communities and of fostering racism against Latinos .
2007_03_01_1829725	31	They say that such attitudes led to the 2000 case in which two white men lured two Mexican day laborers to an abandoned warehouse with a promise of work and then beat them .
2007_03_01_1829725	32	The Latino leaders called the anti-loitering law an attempt to criminalize '' standing while Latino . '' ''
2007_03_01_1829725	33	He 's attacking a community for political gain , '' said Nadia Marin-Molina , executive director of the Workplace Project , a Latino advocacy group with offices in Hempstead and Farmingville . ''
2007_03_01_1829725	34	He 's making sure the public remembers that he is anti-immigrant .
2007_03_01_1829725	35	He 's playing to anti-immigrant sentiment for political gain , just to get additional votes .
2007_03_01_1829725	36	Suffolk County has low wages and a high cost of living , and he 's telling them to blame the immigrants . '' ''
2007_03_01_1829725	37	We 've tried to meet with him , but he 's refused , '' Ms. Marin-Molina said . ''
2007_03_01_1829725	38	He wo n't work with us and wo n't do anything to address the real issues .
2007_03_01_1829725	39	He 'll only attack us . ''
2007_03_01_1829726	0	The New York City Police Department has commissioned a six-month independent review of the way it stops people on the streets , sometimes searching them for illegal weapons , after the release of statistics that showed the department stopped 508,540 people in the five boroughs last year , officials said yesterday .
2007_03_01_1829726	1	The study will focus on the role that race plays in everyday street stops : some critics have suggested that minorities , particularly black people , were unfairly singled out , a claim the police deny .
2007_03_01_1829726	2	It will be done by the RAND Corporation , a private nonprofit organization that has studied the issue in other cities , including Oakland , Calif. , and Cincinnati , officials said .
2007_03_01_1829726	3	Nearly two months ago , Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly commissioned RAND to review several aspects of firearm use in the department after the fatal police shooting of Sean Bell in Queens in November .
2007_03_01_1829726	4	That study is still under way .
2007_03_01_1829726	5	The issue of stopping people on the streets -- known in department parlance as '' stop and frisks '' -- has been a source of occasional tension between the police and residents .
2007_03_01_1829726	6	As part of the study , analysts from RAND will not only examine last year 's 508,540 stops , but also ride with police officers on duty .
2007_03_01_1829726	7	The officers will be interviewed about their decisions to make stops .
2007_03_01_1829726	8	Analysts will also see firsthand how officers complete forms known as UF-250s , which they are supposed to fill out after all such stops .
2007_03_01_1829726	9	The form captures several points of data , including the circumstances that led to the stop , whether physical force was used , whether the stop included a frisk , and the race or ethnicity of the person stopped .
2007_03_01_1829726	10	A factor cited frequently on the forms is '' area has high crime incidence . ''
2007_03_01_1829726	11	The analysts will also review an electronic database of all the stops made by officers last year and '' take steps to audit the data collection process , '' said Greg Ridgeway , the associate director of RAND 's Safety and Justice Program , who will lead the research in New York .
2007_03_01_1829726	12	Police officials released statistics on Feb. 2 showing that the number of people stopped last year increased to 508,540 from 97,296 in 2002 , the last time the department divulged the data from a single calendar year .
2007_03_01_1829726	13	The officials have said that the steep increase is partly due to greater adherence to departmental rules for filling out the stop-and-frisk forms and more aggressive crime-fighting activities , particularly in high-crime neighborhoods .
2007_03_01_1829726	14	They have repeatedly said that officers do not practice racial profiling .
2007_03_01_1829726	15	In a statement announcing the RAND study yesterday , Mr. Kelly said that while the department 's own analysis of its data '' in general terms showed that stops were consistent with concentrations of crime and of victim descriptions of suspects , '' the RAND analysts would work '' to determine whether there are any flaws that we may need to address . ''
2007_03_01_1829726	16	Responding to complaints of profiling , the department noted that while 55.2 percent of those stopped were black , 68.5 percent of reported crimes involved suspects described as black .
2007_03_01_1829726	17	Mr. Kelly added , '' We thought it was important to have a separate , independent review , and we turned to RAND again because of its reputation for objectivity and quality research . ''
2007_03_01_1829726	18	The study will cost $ 120,000 and will be paid for by New York City Police Foundation , a charity that supports the Police Department .
2007_03_01_1829726	19	Donna Lieberman , the executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union , said that the department 's raw data -- not just its own summary of its data -- should be disclosed publicly and to an array of interested parties , not just to its '' chosen consultants '' at RAND . ''
2007_03_01_1829726	20	The situation cries out for an independent review , '' she said .
2007_03_01_1829726	21	Critics have said that the summary the department released in early February raises as many questions as it answers and , in isolation , is hard to understand .
2007_03_01_1829726	22	For instance , according to the department 's data , the average number of people arrested per quarter as a result of street stops doubled to 5,317 last year , from 2,819 in 2002 .
2007_03_01_1829726	23	But Ms. Lieberman pointed out that the story behind the numbers was that in 2002 , one person was arrested for every 8.5 stops , while last year , one person was arrested for every 25 stops .
2007_03_01_1829726	24	Thomas A. Reppetto , a police historian , said he was eager to hear what RAND finds . ''
2007_03_01_1829726	25	I want the constitutional question answered , '' Mr. Reppetto said . ''
2007_03_01_1829726	26	Are these stops , frisks and searches reasonable ?
2007_03_01_1829726	27	That is what the U.S. Constitution demands , that searches not be unreasonable . ''
2007_03_01_1829727	0	The arrests of four people in Florida on Tuesday and the indictments of at least six doctors around the country linked to a pharmacy in Orlando , Fla. , present striking evidence that authorities in several states have opened a new front in the war against illegal online sales of steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs .
2007_03_01_1829727	1	Albany County prosecutors , working with federal investigators and Florida officials , have linked 11 doctors to the pharmacy .
2007_03_01_1829727	2	Six face felony charges that they wrote prescriptions to patients they had never met .
2007_03_01_1829727	3	The pharmacy , Signature Pharmacy , has dispensed thousands of prescriptions in recent years and has sold tens of millions of dollars ' worth of controlled substances nationwide , including at least $ 10 million in New York State , the authorities said .
2007_03_01_1829727	4	Signature sold a variety of medications and supplements , some of them prescribed or provided legally , according to the officials .
2007_03_01_1829727	5	They described the typical Signature customer as a well-off man in early middle age , but confirmed that the clientele included people whom the Albany County district attorney described only as '' celebrities . ''
2007_03_01_1829727	6	It remains unclear who those people were or what they bought , although The Times Union of Albany has reported that professional athletes were among the customers of Signature and at least one other online pharmacy that is under investigation .
2007_03_01_1829727	7	Law enforcement officials said that investigators were still sorting through thousands of prescription orders for customers in Albany County and elsewhere , part of a vast haul of evidence taken Tuesday during the raids at two Signature offices in Florida and during the investigation .
2007_03_01_1829727	8	The Albany County district attorney , P. David Soares , emphasized in a news conference on Tuesday that his investigation would focus on doctors and pharmacists -- the suppliers and distributors for the illegal drug network -- rather than on buyers . ''
2007_03_01_1829727	9	A business like this does n't work unless you have other participants , including doctors , who have parted company with their oath , '' Mr. Soares said .
2007_03_01_1829727	10	One of the doctors indicted , Anna Maria Santi , 68 , of Queens , lost her medical license eight years ago after a string of offenses , including drinking while practicing and giving anesthesia to a patient who died during a procedure .
2007_03_01_1829727	11	But she continued providing prescriptions to Signature and other Internet pharmacies for years , under variations of her name and those of at least one other doctor , before her arraignment in Albany in February , the authorities said .
2007_03_01_1829727	12	The names of the other doctors are in sealed indictments and have not been made public .
2007_03_01_1829727	13	But a law enforcement official with knowledge of the investigation said the remaining doctors -- who live in New York and other states -- would be arrested in the coming days , along with pharmacists and other people connected to the ring .
2007_03_01_1829727	14	The goal , the official said , is to shut down the entire drug network connected to Signature .
2007_03_01_1829727	15	Meanwhile , two officials of a Mobile , Ala.-based pharmacy services firm have been indicted by an Albany County grand jury , according to one of the law enforcement officials with knowledge of the investigation .
2007_03_01_1829727	16	It was unclear on Wednesday whether those officials or the company were linked to Signature .
2007_03_01_1829727	17	Travis T. Tygart , general counsel for the United States Anti-Doping Agency , described the investigation and arrests as '' the logical next step in getting at these drugs . '' ''
2007_03_01_1829727	18	It is a natural outgrowth of BALCO and stiffer sentencing guidelines involving the illegal distribution of these performance-enhancing drugs , '' Mr. Tygart said , referring to the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative case , in which six people were convicted of helping distribute anabolic steroids to athletes .
2007_03_01_1829727	19	A track coach , Trevor Graham , and an Olympic cyclist , Tammy Thomas , have been charged with making false statements , and a grand jury is continuing to investigate whether the baseball player Barry Bonds committed perjury .
2007_03_01_1829727	20	Mr. Tygart added , '' Many people have seen these as professional athlete drugs , but they are also middle America , white-collar , feel-good and get-buff drugs . ''
2007_03_01_1829727	21	The arrests in Florida , which involved at least 20 branch offices of state , local and federal law enforcement agencies , were only one prong of a series of overlapping investigations into the underworld of Internet drug sales .
2007_03_01_1829727	22	Law enforcement officials described the investigations as cooperative , with different agencies keeping in regular contact and assisting each other as local investigations sprouted leads in other states .
2007_03_01_1829727	23	In 2005 , in the largest steroid enforcement action in United States history , charges were filed against 23 people and eight Mexican manufacturers and veterinary companies that federal prosecutors said were responsible for 80 percent of the steroids illegally used in the United States .
2007_03_01_1829727	24	Since then , the authorities say , more illegal performance drugs have been coming to the United States from China and Eastern Europe .
2007_03_01_1829727	25	More are finding their way to users through pharmacies , often operating on the Internet , and through doctors who find ways to write prescriptions to skirt the law .
2007_03_01_1829727	26	Anabolic steroids are illegal for any human use .
2007_03_01_1829727	27	While human growth hormone is legal for only a handful of medical uses , violations of the law have rarely been punished .
2007_03_01_1829727	28	Mr. Soares 's investigation into Internet drug sales began two years ago in Albany County , but quickly became linked to inquiries in other states .
2007_03_01_1829727	29	In November 2005 , law enforcement officials from several states , including New York and Florida , and federal authorities held a pivotal meeting to discuss ways to better coordinate the investigations into illegal online sales of steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs .
2007_03_01_1829727	30	In Rhode Island , for instance , a task force within the Food and Drug Administration 's office of criminal investigations began an examination in August 2005 into whether two New York doctors and the owner of a pharmaceutical company in New Jersey had illegally prescribed anabolic steroids and human growth hormones .
2007_03_01_1829727	31	A significant percentage of the business 's customers were in Rhode Island .
2007_03_01_1829727	32	Soon after the November meeting , a knowledgeable law enforcement official said , the Metropolitan Bureau of Investigation , a multi-agency task force in Florida made up of federal , state and local authorities , was assigned to help the federal Drug Enforcement Administration and the state in their inquiry into Signature Pharmacy in Orlando .
2007_03_01_1829727	33	About six months later , Florida investigators and law enforcement from New York State learned that they were all investigating Signature and linked up . ''
2007_03_01_1829727	34	The M.B.I. and a group of agents from the D.E.A. were conducting a separate investigation into the online sales of steroids and human growth hormones , and at some point the investigators crossed paths with their New York counterparts , '' Lt. Carl Metzger of the Metropolitan Bureau of Investigation 's Orlando office said in a telephone interview Wednesday .
2007_03_01_1829727	35	More than half a year after that , New York law enforcement authorities and investigators with the Metropolitan Bureau of Investigation carried out Tuesday 's raid on Signature , along with the D.E.A. and representatives of the New York Bureau of Narcotics , among others .
2007_03_01_1829727	36	Mr. Metzger and other law enforcement officials said that the arrests were led by New York investigators because Mr. Soares 's investigation was more advanced than local inquiries , and because New York , unlike most states , punishes illegal prescription sales as felonies . ''
2007_03_01_1829727	37	New York was in a position to make the arrests since they were a little further along and more advanced in their investigation , and we were in a position to issue the search warrants , '' Mr. Metzger said .
2007_03_01_1829727	38	Ms. Santi was also indicted in February in Rhode Island on charges of illegal drug distribution , health care fraud and money laundering , along with Daniel McGlone , 54 , of North Brunswick , N.J. Victor Mariani , a New York doctor , is named in the indictment but is charged separately with participating in the same conspiracy .
2007_03_01_1829727	39	The three are accused of running a scheme to illegally prescribe anabolic steroids and human growth hormones .
2007_03_01_1829727	40	Correction : March 3 , 2007 , Saturday An article on Thursday about the opening of a new front in the war against illegal online sales of steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs referred incorrectly to anabolic steroids .
2007_03_01_1829727	41	They may be legally prescribed by doctors for some disorders ; they are not illegal for any human use .
2007_03_01_1829728	0	Dr. Diane E. Meier , a geriatrician at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York , is an expert on end-of-life care .
2007_03_01_1829728	1	So when her elderly parents needed long-term help at home with bathing , dressing and cooking after her father 's stroke , she knew where to find assistance .
2007_03_01_1829728	2	It was not through agencies in Manhattan that provide home health aides who are bonded , insured and certified .
2007_03_01_1829728	3	A year of custodial care from such an agency would cost her family $ 150,000 , and in short order exhaust its savings because aides are not covered by government assistance unless patients are poor or fresh from a hospital stay .
2007_03_01_1829728	4	Instead Dr. Meier turned to '' a little list '' of aides from the so-called gray market , an over-the-back-fence network of women .
2007_03_01_1829728	5	They are usually untrained , unscreened and unsupervised , but more affordable without an agency 's fee , less constrained by regulations and hired through personal recommendation .
2007_03_01_1829728	6	With 4.2 million Americans currently over 85 -- a number expected to grow to 5.9 million by 2014 and then accelerate with the baby boom generation -- the exploding need for long-term care is remaking the home-care industry , driving more of it underground .
2007_03_01_1829728	7	Gray-market hiring , fraught with risks , is a solution that middle-class families are turning to as they face the crushing burden of indefinite home-care expenses .
2007_03_01_1829728	8	But it is hardly the only one , as businesses rush to meet the needs of these families , the fastest-growing segment of the marketplace , who are intent on keeping their loved ones out of nursing homes .
2007_03_01_1829728	9	Traditional agencies like the Visiting Nurse Service , founded to serve the poor with all manner of home health care , are opening divisions geared toward clients who must pay their own way .
2007_03_01_1829728	10	At VNS , 15 percent of clients now pay out of pocket , an 11 percent increase over last year , and aides trained in wound care and vital signs are also learning to interact with doormen , use espresso machines or escort a client to the opera .
2007_03_01_1829728	11	At the same time , upscale agencies providing trained aides are proliferating solely for the private-pay market , as are national chains with more modest services -- and more reasonable prices .
2007_03_01_1829728	12	These franchises are intended for today 's consumer of home health care who need simple companionship , reminders to take medication , an escort to doctors ' appointments and help preparing meals .
2007_03_01_1829728	13	The largest of these chains , Home Instead , opened in 1994 with six franchises and now has 722 .
2007_03_01_1829728	14	Their 37,000 part-time workers tend to the needs of 43,000 elderly clients .
2007_03_01_1829728	15	The advantage is a lower hourly fee -- say , $ 15 an hour for nonmedical needs vs. $ 20 an hour for a trained agency aide -- and the disadvantage a scramble to find more skilled help as a patient 's health declines .
2007_03_01_1829728	16	Policy experts worry that the new home health care businesses could put profit above quality . ''
2007_03_01_1829728	17	Consumers are always in jeopardy when there 's an opportunity to make a lot of money , '' said Val J. Halamandaris , president of the National Association of Home Care , who 40 years ago was chief counsel to the Senate Committee on Aging . ''
2007_03_01_1829728	18	Sometimes it works out beautifully , and sometimes it does n't .
2007_03_01_1829728	19	But nobody 's policing it ; that 's for sure . ''
2007_03_01_1829728	20	Gray-market hiring , which Dr. Meier says most of her patients choose , is largely a financial decision to avoid the fees of home-care agencies , where perhaps $ 9 of the $ 20 hourly fee goes to the aide .
2007_03_01_1829728	21	In a gray-market arrangement , the aide might get $ 12 , a 33 percent increase -- although sometimes without benefits , worker 's compensation or Social Security -- leaving a family able to afford additional hours .
2007_03_01_1829728	22	Many who have hired by word-of-mouth , without criminal background checks , and paid directly cite the loyalty of employees and their ability to work unfettered by regulations .
2007_03_01_1829728	23	Some agencies , for example , prohibit their aides from lifting a patient who has fallen without calling 911 or getting approval from a supervisor .
2007_03_01_1829728	24	That rule protects a client from being moved improperly , the aide from injury and an agency from liability .
2007_03_01_1829728	25	But some families shudder at the prospect of a loved one lying on the floor .
2007_03_01_1829728	26	Many families worry more about temperament than tasks .
2007_03_01_1829728	27	Dr. Meier , and most of her patients say that entrusting someone with intimate care is less a reasoned decision than an intuition about character . ''
2007_03_01_1829728	28	You can teach someone how to turn a bed-bound person , '' Dr. Meier said , '' but you ca n't teach the milk of human kindness . ''
2007_03_01_1829728	29	Others say they chose gray-market employees if family members insisted upon someone of the same race .
2007_03_01_1829728	30	That is why Michael Elsas , president of Cooperative Home Care Associates in the Bronx , a worker-owned agency , turned to what he called '' the German au pair network , '' rather than his own better-trained aides , for his mother .
2007_03_01_1829728	31	But as her Parkinson 's disease progressed , Mr. Elsas said , the au pairs were not up to the task .
2007_03_01_1829728	32	He hired two aides from his agency , keeping one of the German women to placate his mother . ''
2007_03_01_1829728	33	The cost quadrupled , '' Mr. Elsas said , to $ 1,400 a week , from $ 350 .
2007_03_01_1829728	34	Referrals from corporate employee-assistance plans and also coverage under long-term care insurance are fueling the growth of the full-service agencies .
2007_03_01_1829728	35	Senior Bridge , for example , has expanded from New York City to 18 suburban and Sun Belt locations .
2007_03_01_1829728	36	And House Works in Boston , a boutique agency with fewer than 700 clients , has seen its gross revenue grow in six years to $ 9 million , from $ 590,000 .
2007_03_01_1829728	37	According to the American Association of Long-Term Care Insurance , a trade group for agents , more than one-third of the $ 63.3 billion in benefits paid in 2006 went toward home care .
2007_03_01_1829728	38	But policies differ in whether they cover only certified aides or a broader menu including gray-market employees or companions .
2007_03_01_1829728	39	And state insurance officials worry about the pressure to deny benefits as more policyholders , now in their 50s and 60s , begin to make claims .
2007_03_01_1829728	40	The demand for home care aides throughout the industry is expected to outstrip supply .
2007_03_01_1829728	41	The Bureau of Labor Statistics counted 663,280 such aides in 2005 , up from 577,530 in 1999 , a tally that does not include gray-market workers .
2007_03_01_1829728	42	But the Census Bureau reports a stagnant number of women with little education , ages 25 to 54 , the traditional labor pool for this occupation , just as the 85-and-over population is soaring .
2007_03_01_1829728	43	Innovators in the field are looking for ways to reduce turnover , estimated at 40 percent to 100 percent a year by various agencies .
2007_03_01_1829728	44	This so-called churn results in an inexperienced and uncommitted work force .
2007_03_01_1829728	45	The Service Employees International Union has been at the cutting edge of creating a more stable pool of workers .
2007_03_01_1829728	46	In New York , Local 1199 unionized 60,000 home-care employees .
2007_03_01_1829728	47	Unionized aides , many of them former welfare recipients , get a full array of benefits , rare in this industry , and opportunities to master English , study nursing or learn computer skills .
2007_03_01_1829728	48	One of the union 's newest offerings is a sort of consciousness-raising group , focusing on self-esteem and a sense of community among otherwise isolated workers .
2007_03_01_1829728	49	Last month , 13 aides from an agency in Queens shared their gripes with a facilitator .
2007_03_01_1829728	50	Many had been summoned from clients ' homes just moments before the workshop .
2007_03_01_1829728	51	This sort of administrative confusion was typical , they said , and along with wages , which average $ 9.34 an hour nationwide , is their main complaint .
2007_03_01_1829728	52	But aides also said clients criticized their broken English , refused to eat their ethnic food , touched them inappropriately or assumed they would steal .
2007_03_01_1829728	53	The Visiting Nurse Service is raising its pay scale to $ 10 an hour by 2008 .
2007_03_01_1829728	54	Compensation will be tied to seniority , which VNS hopes will reduce turnover , and to the completion of specialty training in areas like Alzheimer 's disease , which will provide career ladders for aides .
2007_03_01_1829728	55	By all accounts , there is only one training program in the country for gray-market aides , at the Schmieding Center for Senior Health and Education at the University of Arkansas .
2007_03_01_1829728	56	There , Dr. Larry Wright , a geriatrician , designed a 119-hour curriculum for independent contractors , most enrolled by private employers .
2007_03_01_1829728	57	The course costs only $ 275 , thanks to the subsidy of a benefactor .
2007_03_01_1829728	58	Dr. Wright makes a case for buttressing the independent work force . ''
2007_03_01_1829728	59	If I saw agencies doing fantastic work , it would be one thing , '' said Dr. Wright , who says most agencies do little more than criminal background checks . ''
2007_03_01_1829728	60	But there 's not much value added and significant cost . ''
2007_03_01_1829728	61	Even the best-trained agency aides wind up improvising in the privacy of a client 's home .
2007_03_01_1829728	62	It may be against the rules to escort patients in a private vehicle or use their credit cards when shopping .
2007_03_01_1829728	63	But Mr. Elsas , of Cooperative Home Care Associates , has no doubt it happens . ''
2007_03_01_1829728	64	The system depends on the good judgment and integrity of workers who may be making $ 7 an hour , '' he said . ''
2007_03_01_1829728	65	What 's wrong with that picture ? ''
2007_03_01_1829728	66	One effort to instill good judgment is a peer-mentoring program at Mr. Elsas 's agency where senior aides make in-home visits to newcomers .
2007_03_01_1829728	67	But a home setting precludes the oversight found in nursing homes , tightened after the scandals of the 1970s .
2007_03_01_1829728	68	Setting national standards for agency employees , independent contractors and even family caretakers is one goal of a conference in March at the International Longevity Center in New York .
2007_03_01_1829728	69	Sheila Baker , a geriatric social worker who has hired gray-market help for her mother , prefers informal oversight .
2007_03_01_1829728	70	At Mount Sinai 's geriatric clinic , for example , aides escorting patients to medical appointments are always asked to leave the room long enough for the elderly person to speak freely about the arrangement .
2007_03_01_1829728	71	And at Ms. Baker 's mother 's apartment , even with a gray-market aide who was once a physician in the Philippines , Ms. Baker and her sister , a nurse , make unannounced visits .
2007_03_01_1829728	72	Larry Minnix , head of the American Association of Homes and Services for the Aging , advocates national standards to prevent a repeat of the nursing home scandals in the home-care arena .
2007_03_01_1829728	73	And he speaks from personal experience .
2007_03_01_1829728	74	Before they died , Mr. Minnix 's in-laws were cared for at home by one beloved aide hired from the gray market .
2007_03_01_1829728	75	That aide , in turn , hired friends for additional help .
2007_03_01_1829728	76	One , who did yard work , had a criminal record .
2007_03_01_1829728	77	Another , with a family of nine , ran up exorbitant grocery bills because she was taking most of the food home .
2007_03_01_1829728	78	But his in-laws , Mr. Minnix said , were dependent on the original aide and fearful of changing the arrangement . ''
2007_03_01_1829728	79	This could happen to anyone , '' he said . ''
2007_03_01_1829728	80	And it 's something the country does n't know what to do about yet . ''
2007_03_01_1829728	81	Correction : March 2 , 2007 , Friday A front-page article yesterday about home health care aides misstated the amount of long-term care insurance benefits paid in 2006 and misstated the name of the organization that provided the figure .
2007_03_01_1829728	82	The benefits totaled $ 3.3 billion , not $ 63.3 billion .
2007_03_01_1829728	83	The organization was the Association for -- not of -- Long-Term Care Insurance .
2007_03_01_1829729	0	The craft that is to replace the space shuttle could be delayed because of recent budget reductions , pushing its first missions into 2015 instead of 2014 , the NASA administrator , Michael D. Griffin , told a Senate committee on Wednesday .
2007_03_01_1829729	1	Mr. Griffin said the reductions could shift money from the development of the Orion crew vehicle and the Ares I rocket .
2007_03_01_1829729	2	That would widen by four to six months the period in which the United States could not send humans into space after the shuttle is retired in 2010 .
2007_03_01_1829729	3	Mr. Griffin said other nations would continue to fly people and cargo into space while the United States was grounded . ''
2007_03_01_1829729	4	For the United States not to be among them is tragic , '' he said , adding : '' When you do n't fly for four or more years , people become stale .
2007_03_01_1829729	5	Very good people often move into other enterprises where there is more action .
2007_03_01_1829729	6	It 's not a good thing . ''
2007_03_01_1829729	7	After the hearing , before the Senate Committee on Commerce , Science and Transportation , Mr. Griffin said a chance remained that the Orion 's first missions could come in December 2014 .
2007_03_01_1829729	8	But he warned that it would not be possible if early development money was reduced .
2007_03_01_1829729	9	Senators Bill Nelson , Democrat of Florida and chairman of the committee 's Space and Aeronautics Subcommittee , and Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas , the ranking Republican , repeated their hope for limiting the '' gap '' in American manned space flight .
2007_03_01_1829729	10	Mr. Nelson said that it was a national security issue and that he would push for more money for the shuttle replacement in a supplemental spending bill this spring .
2007_03_01_1829729	11	The Bush administration has proposed a $ 17.3 billion budget for NASA in the 2008 fiscal year , a 3 percent increase over the previous year .
2007_03_01_1829729	12	Mr. Griffin said the proposal demonstrated President Bush 's commitment to space leadership and was enough to keep NASA on track .
2007_03_01_1829729	13	Mr. Griffin said NASA 's biggest planning problem was the resolution the president signed on Feb. 15 that froze 2007 spending at the previous year 's level because Congress had not passed separate spending bills before the end of last year .
2007_03_01_1829729	14	This appropriation reduces overall NASA financing by $ 545 million from the original 2007 request .
2007_03_01_1829729	15	In addition , Mr. Griffin said , the measure directed $ 677 million in specific reductions in the agency 's human space flight budget , including $ 577 million from the program developing the Orion , to be redistributed to other NASA programs . ''
2007_03_01_1829729	16	The bottom line is that we are down about half a billion dollars , and most of that came from the Orion Program , '' Mr. Griffin said .
2007_03_01_1829729	17	Developing the Orion will cost $ 10 billion , he said .
2007_03_01_1829729	18	Mr. Griffin said NASA was studying a space station safety report released on Tuesday by an independent panel of experts .
2007_03_01_1829729	19	The report noted risks to the International Space Station from orbiting debris and micrometeoroids , among other concerns .
2007_03_01_1829729	20	NASA had already been working on most of those problems , he said . ''
2007_03_01_1829729	21	Every day , there is about a one in 100,000 chance that the space station will be critically damaged by a piece of orbital debris , '' Mr. Griffin said , '' It 's not great , but the risk is there .
2007_03_01_1829730	0	That 's the advice to authorities who raided what could be a major sports drug con-nection on Tuesday .
2007_03_01_1829730	1	Do n't let glazed looks and polite little yawns from the public or the press deter you .
2007_03_01_1829730	2	It is n't important if big-time sports names are busted in this investigation .
2007_03_01_1829730	3	The main thing is that the raid may have saved the life of somebody 's son , somebody 's brother , who is putting bad stuff into his system .
2007_03_01_1829730	4	In this celebrity-driven world , everybody gets excited about seeing Barry Bonds or Marion Jones or Floyd Landis pop up in the headlines .
2007_03_01_1829730	5	But passing out paper cups to athletes in the locker room is just one way of slowing down our millionaire role models who may be on some kind of juice or another . ''
2007_03_01_1829730	6	I understand that the involvement of athletes and celebrities makes this a sexy story , but I assure you we are not , at this point , concerned with the celebrity factor , '' Albany County District Attorney P. David Soares was quoted by The Associated Press as saying . ''
2007_03_01_1829730	7	Our focus here is to shut down distribution channels . ''
2007_03_01_1829730	8	Right now , people are titillated by the dropping of names like Gary Matthews Jr. of the Angels , who had a career season last year .
2007_03_01_1829730	9	His name surfaced first in The Times Union of Albany , which cited unidentified sources .
2007_03_01_1829730	10	Matthews would not discuss the case in detail yesterday .
2007_03_01_1829730	11	More important was that Tuesday 's raids at two Signature Pharmacy stores in Orlando , Fla. , might have been a blow to the supply lines for the steroids , human growth hormone and testosterone flowing into high schools and colleges . ''
2007_03_01_1829730	12	You use the consumer to build your case against the manufacturer , '' Travis T. Tygart , the senior managing director and general counsel of the United States Anti-Doping Agency , said yesterday .
2007_03_01_1829730	13	The agency , founded only in 2000 , is known for its high-profile suspensions of athletes like Tim Montgomery , Chryste Gaines , Michelle Collins , Alvin Harrison and Kelli White , based on investigations around the country . ''
2007_03_01_1829730	14	We 've had nonanalytical evidence , '' Tygart said in a telephone interview , citing factors like '' doping calendars , e-mails , documents , testimony . ''
2007_03_01_1829730	15	He added , '' You build your case on evidence , not just positive drug tests . ''
2007_03_01_1829730	16	Joe Frazier , known for his left hook , used to quote the old boxing adage , '' You kill the body and the head will die . ''
2007_03_01_1829730	17	The same procedure seems valid for the drug chain .
2007_03_01_1829730	18	Whack away at the midsection often enough , and the big-name athletes will have trouble getting their fix .
2007_03_01_1829730	19	Meantime , lives will be saved , young lives of athletes whose coaches strongly hint that they bulk up or not make the varsity . ''
2007_03_01_1829730	20	These are more than over-the-counter drugs , '' said Dr. Gary I. Wadler , an associate professor of medicine at New York University and a member of the World Anti-Doping Agency . ''
2007_03_01_1829730	21	These are drugs that have special laws written for them .
2007_03_01_1829730	22	These are serious drugs .
2007_03_01_1829730	23	There 's a litany of side effects that can be irreversible , not evident for years .
2007_03_01_1829730	24	You think you 're getting a free ride , but you 're not . ''
2007_03_01_1829730	25	The evidence is still coming in from the sports drugs used in recent years .
2007_03_01_1829730	26	David Segui , a longtime major leaguer who admitted using human growth hormone through a legal prescription , had numerous injuries late in his career .
2007_03_01_1829730	27	Mark McGwire , who used a body-building substance banned in Olympic sports and was accused by Jose Canseco of using illegal steroids , broke down quickly near the end of his career .
2007_03_01_1829730	28	Wadler , an internist , said he believed steroids had led to suicides and the early deaths of high school and college athletes . ''
2007_03_01_1829730	29	My concern is doping fatigue , '' Wadler said in a telephone interview yesterday , meaning that authorities and the public could grow bored with the war on doping .
2007_03_01_1829730	30	But he also said that the Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 2004 , which upgraded the penalties for those illegal drugs , had encouraged federal and regional prosecutors to go after the athletic supply line . ''
2007_03_01_1829730	31	There 's more bang to the buck , '' Wadler said , adding that prosecutors had gone after heroin , cocaine and marijuana because the penalties and conviction rates looked better . ''
2007_03_01_1829730	32	I think you 're going to see more prosecution , '' Wadler predicted .
2007_03_01_1829730	33	One intriguing portion of the Albany-Orlando connection is what the authorities described as the shipment of about $ 100,000 worth of human growth hormone to Dr. Richard A. Rydze of Pittsburgh , a physician who does some work for the Steelers in addition to having a private practice .
2007_03_01_1829730	34	He said he was warned by investigators to stop patronizing Signature Pharmacy in Orlando and said he had never prescribed the drug to any members of the Steelers .
2007_03_01_1829730	35	The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center , where Rydze works , said yesterday that it had begun an internal review after learning about the investigation .
2007_03_01_1829730	36	Somehow or other , football players continue to grow bigger .
2007_03_01_1829730	37	No matter what officials say , Major League Baseball and the National Football League have been forced into accepting more testing and punishment only in the wake of public scandal and Congressional hearings , and they have shown little interest in aggressively combating the supply line .
2007_03_01_1829730	38	By contrast , USADA and WADA have reached out to law enforcement and prosecution . ''
2007_03_01_1829730	39	They can only ensure the rights of the clean athletes , '' Tygart said .
2007_03_01_1829730	40	The investigations can also save the lives of young athletes whose names will never be in the headlines , good or bad .
2007_03_01_1829730	41	SPORTS OF THE TIMES E-mail : geovecs@nytimes.com
2007_03_01_1829732	0	It is not clear how the face of the former Dodgers owner Walter O'Malley came to appear on a flour tortilla in Los Angeles .
2007_03_01_1829732	1	When on display , it is usually accompanied by a card noting that '' the provenance of the tortilla is sketchy . ''
2007_03_01_1829732	2	However , the card continues , '' Radio carbon dating indicates that the tortilla is approximately forty years old . '' ''
2007_03_01_1829732	3	It 's an interesting tortilla , '' said Terry Cannon , its curator .
2007_03_01_1829732	4	Cannon is the president , founder and general instigator of the Baseball Reliquary , a California-based traveling museum and shrine that serves as a puckish alternative to the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown , N.Y. Based out of Cannon 's home and assorted Southern California storage units , the Reliquary celebrates baseball 's pioneers and free spirits , those individuals whose greatness could never be charted by the Elias Sports Bureau . ''
2007_03_01_1829732	5	If Borges liked baseball , this is where he 'd want to be enshrined , '' said Ron Shelton , the director of films like '' Bull Durham '' and '' Cobb . ''
2007_03_01_1829732	6	As the O'Malley tortilla illustrates , the Reliquary exists in the gap between baseball legend and reality . ''
2007_03_01_1829732	7	You go to the Hall of Fame , you 're surrounded by uniforms and balls and bats and that 's all great , these are great artifacts .
2007_03_01_1829732	8	But that 's all they are , they 're artifacts , '' said Buddy Kilchesty , the Reliquary 's archivist and historian . ''
2007_03_01_1829732	9	What if the imagination had some say in what the artifacts were ? ''
2007_03_01_1829732	10	Cannon puts it this way : '' We always say that what 's important is n't so much the artifact , it 's the story behind it . ''
2007_03_01_1829732	11	Hence the O'Malley tortilla , which the Reliquary uses to teach the history of Chavez Ravine , the site of Dodger Stadium .
2007_03_01_1829732	12	Or Dock Ellis 's hair curlers , which help tell the story of race relations in baseball 's post-Jackie Robinson era .
2007_03_01_1829732	13	Or 12 baseballs allegedly signed by Mother Teresa ( fandom ) , or Eddie Gaedel 's jockstrap ( midgets ) or a piece of skin from Abner Doubleday 's thigh ( ossification ? ) .
2007_03_01_1829732	14	Cannon is an enthusiastic 53-year-old with an abiding interest in experimental film , jazz , the American Basketball Association , classic cars ( he once edited a magazine called Skinned Knuckles ) , vinyl records and , not least , baseball .
2007_03_01_1829732	15	He has , at one point or another , led or participated in groups pertaining to most of these interests . ''
2007_03_01_1829732	16	When I get involved in something , I do n't get involved in a cursory way ; I throw myself into it , '' he admitted , somewhat ruefully .
2007_03_01_1829732	17	He founded the Reliquary in 1996 . ''
2007_03_01_1829732	18	Like so many of us , he 's a guy who reveres -- and I mean reveres -- the game of baseball , and this is his small way of honoring it , '' said Peter Golenbock , a Reliquary member and the author of baseball books like '' Bums '' and '' The Forever Boys . ''
2007_03_01_1829732	19	It is an irreverent sort of reverence .
2007_03_01_1829732	20	A life-size cardboard cutout of Sparky Anderson stands next to Cannon 's bed .
2007_03_01_1829732	21	In his living room , there is a large display case with a triptych of Babe Ruth memorabilia -- one of the Babe 's half-smoked cigars , purportedly rescued from a Philadelphia brothel in 1924 , and the sacristy box with which Ruth was once administered the last rites .
2007_03_01_1829732	22	( He recovered . )
2007_03_01_1829732	23	Usually one of Ruth 's half-eaten hot dogs sits to the right of the sacristy box , but it is currently out for repairs .
2007_03_01_1829732	24	Strictly speaking , not all of the Reliquary 's treasures are real .
2007_03_01_1829732	25	But the Barnumesque quality of much of its collections is intended as a commentary on the nature of baseball artifacts and the reverent way they are often presented . ''
2007_03_01_1829732	26	When you present a display in a professional and straight-faced manner without the appearance of irony , people believe what 's there , '' Cannon said .
2007_03_01_1829732	27	Take the Eddie Grant monument , for example .
2007_03_01_1829732	28	Grant was the first baseball player to be killed in the First World War .
2007_03_01_1829732	29	A commemorative plaque was affixed to a stone monument in the center field of the Polo Grounds until it disappeared after the Giants ' last game there in 1957 .
2007_03_01_1829732	30	The Reliquary created a replica of the plaque and began displaying it in 2000 , as a means of telling Grant 's story .
2007_03_01_1829732	31	Perhaps inevitably , most people mistook the replica for the real thing . ''
2007_03_01_1829732	32	They did n't believe that anybody would bother to replicate the plaque , '' Cannon said .
2007_03_01_1829732	33	A group called the Eddie Grant Memorial Association hounded the Reliquary to return the plaque .
2007_03_01_1829732	34	Vin Scully mentioned it on a Dodgers broadcast .
2007_03_01_1829732	35	Finally , because nobody would believe otherwise , the Reliquary started saying that the plaque was , in fact , the original .
2007_03_01_1829732	36	Reliquary members are still sticking to that story -- somewhat . ''
2007_03_01_1829732	37	As far as I 'm concerned , it is real , '' Kilchesty said . ''
2007_03_01_1829732	38	We found it in an ex-cop 's apartment in Ho Ho Kus , N.J. '' The Reliquary broadened its scope in 1999 , when Cannon founded the Shrine of the Eternals , his answer to the Baseball Hall of Fame .
2007_03_01_1829732	39	Each year , the Reliquary 's approximately 200 members -- membership is open to anybody who pays $ 25 -- elect three candidates from a field of 50 nominees .
2007_03_01_1829732	40	Nomination criteria are fairly arbitrary -- alongside such giants of the game as Satchel Paige and Shoeless Joe Jackson , past nominees have included the notoriously light-hitting Mario Mendoza , the fictional character Henry Wiggen from the book '' Bang the Drum Slowly , '' and John Meeden , a homeless softball player known as '' the hobo Roy Hobbs . ''
2007_03_01_1829732	41	Newcomers to this year 's field of 50 nominees include Jim Brosnan , a relief pitcher and the author of '' The Long Season , '' the former Yankee slugger Roger Maris ( returning to the ballot after an absence of several years ) and the dead ball-era saloonkeeper Nuff Ced McGreevey , perhaps baseball 's first superfan .
2007_03_01_1829732	42	Some Reliquary members offered previews of their ballots : Shelton , the film director , plans to vote for the 1950s minor league fireballer Steve Dalkowski ; Golenbock will select Maris and Brosnan , but not the one-armed outfielder Pete Gray , whose teammates '' to a man , hated his guts , '' he noted .
2007_03_01_1829732	43	Inductees are honored at a ceremony each July at the Pasadena , Calif. , Central Library .
2007_03_01_1829732	44	Assuming they are not busy with baseball card shows ( Cannon 's greatest worry ) , the honorees are flown to Southern California , presented with their plaques at the ceremony and invited to speak .
2007_03_01_1829732	45	Twenty-four individuals have been elected so far , ranging from Ellis and Minnie Minoso to the Japanese-American baseball pioneer Kenichi Zenimura and Pam Postema , the minor-league umpire .
2007_03_01_1829732	46	Many inductees , while pleased at the recognition , are unsure what to make of the honor . ''
2007_03_01_1829732	47	It puzzled me a little at first , '' said Marvin Miller , the longtime head of the players union , who nonetheless traveled to Pasadena to accept his plaque .
2007_03_01_1829732	48	The plaques are multicolored acrylic rectangles ; they resemble something that might hang on the wall at a Swedish kindergarten .
2007_03_01_1829732	49	Bill Lee , well known by his nickname Spaceman , thought his plaque would be a nice addition to his chicken coop .
2007_03_01_1829732	50	Jimmy Piersall , inducted in 2001 , keeps his plaque in his bathroom .
2007_03_01_1829732	51	The term Reliquary confuses many inductees , too . ''
2007_03_01_1829732	52	Their friends are like , ' I do n't know whether to congratulate you or to bid you farewell , ' '' Cannon said .
2007_03_01_1829732	53	Cannon , who views the Reliquary as a work of conceptual art , is happy to inspire such befuddlement .
2007_03_01_1829732	54	But those who know him say there is a sobriety of purpose behind the jesting . ''
2007_03_01_1829732	55	Despite the fact that he likes to have fun , he 's a serious individual and an intelligent one , and he deserves to be taken seriously , '' Miller said .
2007_03_01_1829732	56	The Reliquary has spearheaded several scholarly initiatives , including extensive exhibits on Mexican-American baseball and the history of baseball scouting .
2007_03_01_1829732	57	There has been discussion about finding a permanent home for the Reliquary .
2007_03_01_1829732	58	Cannon has mixed feelings about this .
2007_03_01_1829732	59	He enjoys the Reliquary 's itinerant nature , but sees the benefits in settling down .
2007_03_01_1829732	60	For one thing , it would give him something to do with the inductee 's plaques , which are housed in cardboard boxes in a cabinet in his study . ''
2007_03_01_1829732	61	I 'd like to have them all in one place and lit from behind , so that when you walk into this room , you just get this wash of color , '' he said .
2007_03_01_1829732	62	He held a plaque up to a desk lamp . ''
2007_03_01_1829732	63	Just a wash of color . ''
2007_03_01_1829734	0	In his first year as chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission , Christopher Cox confounded both supporters and detractors by taking a more moderate and nuanced position than they had predicted on a variety of regulatory issues , based on his record as a conservative Republican lawmaker .
2007_03_01_1829734	1	In recent weeks , however , Mr. Cox has begun to send signals , both directly and through aides , that he may be swinging the pendulum more toward business and Wall Street interests and against investor groups .
2007_03_01_1829734	2	Some investor advocates and securities law experts say that Mr. Cox , by not pushing for tighter regulation of hedge funds and by urging the Supreme Court to adopt a tougher standard for investors in lawsuits , has begun moving closer to the business view that the administration overreacted to the corporate scandals that began with the collapse of Enron in 2001 .
2007_03_01_1829734	3	They have also criticized his recent decision to appear at the Chamber of Commerce in two weeks just as it is to issue a report criticizing the Bush administration and the S.E.C. for being too hard on companies . ''
2007_03_01_1829734	4	You look at a parade of items and it begins to look to me like this commission is starting to take an historic shift away from investor interests , '' said James D. Cox , a law professor at Duke University .
2007_03_01_1829734	5	The S.E.C. chairman strongly disputes that view , noting , for instance , that his appearance before the chamber should not be perceived as a change in the tilt of the agency . ''
2007_03_01_1829734	6	The United States government has an agency that services business and it is the Department of Commerce , '' he said . ''
2007_03_01_1829734	7	Our role is to be the investors ' advocate .
2007_03_01_1829734	8	I want to make sure that every company understands that so long as they treat their investors well , the S.E.C. will be friendly to them . ''
2007_03_01_1829734	9	And if they attempt to drive a wedge between the interests of investors and the interests of management , '' Mr. Cox added , '' we will be their relentless adversaries . ''
2007_03_01_1829734	10	It has not been easy to pigeonhole Mr. Cox .
2007_03_01_1829734	11	As an influential congressman from Orange County in California , he sponsored a measure to loosen accounting standards for stock options granted to senior executives and another making it harder for investors to sue companies .
2007_03_01_1829734	12	But soon after he arrived at the commission in the summer of 2005 , Mr. Cox advanced investor-friendly rules to make executive pay packages more transparent .
2007_03_01_1829734	13	He announced that he would continue to support the initiatives of his predecessor , William H. Donaldson , who ran up against a powerful Wall Street constituency with a great deal of clout in the Bush administration when he sought to regulate hedge funds and mutual funds more tightly .
2007_03_01_1829734	14	And Mr. Cox initially disappointed some business groups that had urged him to dilute the force of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act , the post-Enron legislation that tightened accounting and governance rules , on small companies .
2007_03_01_1829734	15	In an hourlong interview this week , Mr. Cox challenged the criticism that he is retrenching from any of that , saying that he has responded to court decisions and budget constraints but that he remains committed to protecting investors .
2007_03_01_1829734	16	Moreover , he said that he sharply disagreed with the view , put forward by several business groups in recent months , that tough regulation was making American markets less competitive and driving companies issuing stock to overseas exchanges . ''
2007_03_01_1829734	17	The inference that some have drawn that this competition is caused by regulation is wrong , '' Mr. Cox said . ''
2007_03_01_1829734	18	Some have made the case that our strong regulation and enforcement are indeed the cause of the opposite , of our strength .
2007_03_01_1829734	19	At the Securities and Exchange Commission it is our intent to make those observations true . ''
2007_03_01_1829734	20	But his critics still contend that signs of back-pedaling have begun to emerge .
2007_03_01_1829734	21	After the commission suffered a legal setback on tightening hedge fund regulation , Mr. Cox decided to neither appeal the decision nor seek to overturn it .
2007_03_01_1829734	22	Instead , he abandoned the effort begun by Mr. Donaldson to force all of the firms in the $ 1 trillion hedge fund industry to be registered and open their books to government examiners .
2007_03_01_1829734	23	The commission has embarked on a more modest effort to raise the financial qualifications for investing in such funds .
2007_03_01_1829734	24	After a second court opinion that questioned the commission 's decision to require mutual funds to have independent chairmen , officials said they did not expect the agency to resurrect the proposal .
2007_03_01_1829734	25	Earlier this month , the commission filed a brief with the Supreme Court asking the justices to adopt a legal standard that would make it significantly more difficult for investors to sue corporations for fraud .
2007_03_01_1829734	26	And it was announced this week that Mr. Cox will be a keynote speaker when the United States Chamber of Commerce holds a daylong conference to issue a long-awaited report recommending that the government relax its criminal pursuit of corporations , limit the civil liability of accounting firms , and water down the corporate and accounting rules that were written in response to the collapse of Enron and other scandals .
2007_03_01_1829734	27	Senior Democratic and Republican lawmakers will be at the event , but for the commission , it will represent an awkward appearance .
2007_03_01_1829734	28	Over the last five years , the chamber has been a powerful nemesis of the agency , viewing it as a major impediment to its antiregulatory agenda , repeatedly suing the S.E.C. over its rules and heavily lobbying Congress to overturn them .
2007_03_01_1829734	29	But to some investor groups and corporate law experts , Mr. Cox 's appearance is reflective of a broader political dynamic at the commission , created 73 years ago in the depths of the Depression to police the nation 's stock markets , protect investors and keep corporate America honest . ''
2007_03_01_1829734	30	His presence before the chamber is appalling , and you are beginning to see a real shift into a new high gear , '' said Barbara Roper , director of investor protection at the Consumer Federation of America .
2007_03_01_1829734	31	Lately , Ms. Roper said , the tide has begun to turn as the Bush administration enters its final years in office and business groups have complained that the administration had overreacted to a series of corporate scandals that have now faded from the headlines .
2007_03_01_1829734	32	It is possible '' that we simply misread him , '' Ms. Roper added , but '' as you know , there has been enormous pressure from the business community for some kind of life as they know it pre-Enron and the way it is supposed to look in a Republican administration . ''
2007_03_01_1829734	33	Mr. Cox promised an active pro-investor agenda for the coming year .
2007_03_01_1829734	34	He said it would include a rewriting of one set of regulations to make fees of 401 ( k ) programs more transparent .
2007_03_01_1829734	35	In response to local financing scandals , most recently in San Diego , he also plans to begin rewriting the disclosure and accounting rules governing the way cities raise money through bond offerings .
2007_03_01_1829734	36	He seemed uncomfortable when asked about his decision to appear before the Chamber of Commerce as it prepared to lobby for less regulation , although he noted that the conference would include the participation of a number of other senior S.E.C. officials , along with Democratic and Republican lawmakers .
2007_03_01_1829734	37	He also said that his appearance should not be seen as an endorsement of the chamber 's broadly deregulatory set of recommendations , which he said he had not seen .
2007_03_01_1829734	38	Mr. Cox , 54 , was appointed by President Bush in June 2005 to replace Mr. Donaldson , who abruptly resigned after alienating powerful Wall Street and business interests by embracing some investor causes .
2007_03_01_1829734	39	Mr. Donaldson sought unsuccessfully to overhaul the way mutual funds are governed , force greater disclosure of hedge fund operations and give institutional shareholders more of a say in the election of directors .
2007_03_01_1829734	40	Signaling the prospect of some significantly divisive votes in the coming months , Mr. Cox said that he was not driven to seek consensus or unanimity among the commission 's polarized members .
2007_03_01_1829734	41	Asked about the observations by some that he is driven by consensus , he replied : '' That has been oft repeated , but it 's not my approach . ''
2007_03_01_1829734	42	He said that after listening to one another , '' there is no requirement that we all have to agree , '' suggesting that he was girding for some policy differences to become public .
2007_03_01_1829734	43	Indeed , that seems almost inevitable if the agency is to advance a new agenda .
2007_03_01_1829734	44	The agency 's longest-serving member , Paul S. Atkins , is a libertarian who has been critical of some rules and has fought both in public and behind the scenes with the agency 's two Democrats , Annette L. Nazareth and Roel C. Campos .
2007_03_01_1829734	45	The fifth commissioner , Kathleen L. Casey , recently joined the agency .
2007_03_01_1829734	46	Even though she has little record , officials say she has emerged as an important ally of Mr. Atkins .
2007_03_01_1829735	0	Oracle is near a deal to acquire Hyperion Solutions , which makes software that allows corporations to analyze and track their performance , for more than $ 3.1 billion , according to people briefed on the deal .
2007_03_01_1829735	1	The acquisition is expected to be announced as early as today , these people said .
2007_03_01_1829735	2	The deal would be the latest trophy in a lengthy string of acquisitions by Oracle , the database software giant that has been struggling to grow from within .
2007_03_01_1829735	3	In December , Oracle posted strong earnings growth for its second fiscal quarter , but its growth in license sales disappointed investors .
2007_03_01_1829735	4	The company said at the time that it had failed to close some crucial licensing deals during the quarter .
2007_03_01_1829735	5	License sales rose 28 percent in the quarter , but that was down from 80 percent growth in the previous quarter .
2007_03_01_1829735	6	Exact terms of the deal could not be learned last night .
2007_03_01_1829735	7	Shares of Hyperion slipped 25 cents yesterday in regular trading , to $ 42.84 , giving it a market value of about $ 2.5 billion .
2007_03_01_1829735	8	Oracle shares closed at $ 16.43 , up 14 cents .
2007_03_01_1829735	9	Representatives for Oracle , which is based in Redwood City , Calif. , and Hyperion , with headquarters in Santa Clara , Calif. , could not be reached for comment .
2007_03_01_1829735	10	Oracle has long been known as one of the most aggressive acquirers of technology companies .
2007_03_01_1829735	11	Led by Lawrence J. Ellison , who sees acquisitions as a tool for growth , the company has at times seemed on the verge of gobbling nearly every rival in the business software market .
2007_03_01_1829735	12	In the last three years , Oracle spent more than $ 20 billion on acquisitions , including buying two of its most formidable competitors , PeopleSoft and Siebel .
2007_03_01_1829735	13	PeopleSoft , the company Oracle fought over for nearly two years , was its most notable deal .
2007_03_01_1829735	14	In December 2004 , after a battle for control that grew nasty , Oracle finally acquired PeopleSoft for about $ 10.3 billion , becoming the second-largest maker of business-management software .
2007_03_01_1829735	15	The day after completing the deal , Oracle fired four top officers of PeopleSoft .
2007_03_01_1829735	16	Since that deal , Oracle 's appetite has been unsatiated .
2007_03_01_1829735	17	In 2005 , the company bought a stake in I-flex Solutions , a maker of financial software based in Mumbai , India , for a reported $ 909 million .
2007_03_01_1829735	18	Within the last year , Oracle has struck a series of deals , including a $ 5.9 billion acquisition of Siebel Systems and a $ 440 million purchase of Stellent last year .
2007_03_01_1829735	19	Hyperion would be one of the last pieces to complete Oracle 's strategy .
2007_03_01_1829735	20	Founded in 1981 as IMRS , Hyperion has grown into one of the biggest makers of business analysis software through its Hyperion System 9 suite .
2007_03_01_1829735	21	For the 2006 fiscal year , the company reported $ 765 million in revenue .
2007_03_01_1829735	22	Hyperion itself has grown through a series of deals , notably a 1998 merger with Arbor Software that brought the popular Essbase database software program into its fold .
2007_03_01_1829735	23	Hyperion has long been speculated about as a merger partner with Business Objects , another business analysis software maker , according to analysts .
2007_03_01_1829735	24	Indeed , the two companies held talks this year , but those negotiations collapsed over price and other issues , people briefed on them said .
2007_03_01_1829735	25	Oracle has talked to half a dozen companies recently about acquiring them , according to people familiar with those talks .
2007_03_01_1829735	26	Hyperion has long been on that list .
2007_03_01_1829735	27	Last year , The Mercury News in San Jose ranked Hyperion 's executive chairman , Jeffrey R. Rodek , as No. 49 among the highest-paid executives in Silicon Valley .
2007_03_01_1829735	28	Mr. Rodek , who became chairman and chief executive in 1999 and executive chairman in 2004 , received $ 11.01 million in compensation in 2005 , including salary and stock options .
2007_03_01_1829736	0	Most people buy their digital cameras in one of two broad categories : compact ( tiny , pretty , with snapshot-quality photos ) or digital S.L.R. ( black , bulky , with magazine-quality photos ) .
2007_03_01_1829736	1	Choosing between them is an agonizing task .
2007_03_01_1829736	2	You 're far more likely to have the compact camera with you when a photo op pops up -- and yet in a battle of photo quality , as an Internet commentator once put it , an S.L.R. takes better pictures with its lens cap on .
2007_03_01_1829736	3	There is , however , a narrow category of in-between cameras -- too big for a shirt pocket , but still small enough for a coat pocket .
2007_03_01_1829736	4	At heart , these midsize models are still point-and-shoots , with features you generally do n't get with S.L.R. 's , like a movie-capture mode , a '' live '' back-panel screen while you 're framing a shot , and a price that 's often under $ 350 .
2007_03_01_1829736	5	And yet they offer some of what makes S.L.R. 's so great , like an eyepiece viewfinder , full manual controls and powerful telephoto lenses .
2007_03_01_1829736	6	The midsize Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ8 , Sony DSC-H5 and Canon PowerShot S3 IS , in fact , offer 12X zoom lenses , which blow away the feeble 3X zoom of most compacts .
2007_03_01_1829736	7	And the new Olympus SP-550UZ breaks records with an 18X lens .
2007_03_01_1829736	8	It 's the most powerful zoom available on any camera , compact or even S.L.R. Why is a powerful zoom such a big deal ?
2007_03_01_1829736	9	Because so many of life 's great photographic moments happen at a distance : on a stage ( school play , graduation ceremony , dance recital , wedding ) , a playing field ( soccer , baseball ) or some other kind of field ( lion , elephant , buff-bellied pipit ) .
2007_03_01_1829736	10	Now , when you 're zoomed in that far , it 's very hard to get a steady shot without a tripod ; your hand-held jitters are magnified , resulting in blurriness .
2007_03_01_1829736	11	That 's why these cameras all have optical image stabilization , which makes their otherwise impractical lenses far more practical .
2007_03_01_1829736	12	Despite a price range from $ 307 ( the Panasonic ) to $ 500 ( the Olympus ) , these cameras are amazingly alike .
2007_03_01_1829736	13	All are chunky little gadgets with large-diameter telescoping lenses .
2007_03_01_1829736	14	Each has a pop-up flash , which provides flattering light that minimizes redeye .
2007_03_01_1829736	15	On all but the Sony , the flash does not , however , pop up automatically ; you have open it manually or by pushing a button .
2007_03_01_1829736	16	All of these cameras except the Panasonic use AA batteries .
2007_03_01_1829736	17	You use AA rechargeables most of the time -- and yet , if they die while you 're on the road , you can always pop into a drugstore , pick up some new AAs ( lithiums or even a gross of AA alkalines ) , and keep right on shooting .
2007_03_01_1829736	18	Midsize cameras also have room for another disappearing luxury : an eyepiece viewfinder , which comes in handy when the sun washes out the back-panel screen .
2007_03_01_1829736	19	These models , however , employ electronic viewfinders -- that is , a tiny TV screen inside the eyepiece , rather than a clear piece of glass .
2007_03_01_1829736	20	It shows exactly what you 're about to shoot , but the image is n't as clear , nuanced or smooth as a see-through viewfinder .
2007_03_01_1829736	21	Finally , the photo quality from these cameras has more in common with compacts than with S.L.R. 's .
2007_03_01_1829736	22	Outdoors , or with copious light , all four take terrific clear shots with vivid colors .
2007_03_01_1829736	23	But indoors and after dinnertime , it 's another story .
2007_03_01_1829736	24	You 'll probably have to throw out a significant number of your indoor no-flash photos , which are often victims of horrible graininess or blur .
2007_03_01_1829736	25	Yes , blur ; the stabilizer helps , but ca n't perform miracles .
2007_03_01_1829736	26	One reason is all four cameras contain a tiny sensor ( 0.4 inch diagonal ) .
2007_03_01_1829736	27	That 's not much light-gathering area , especially when compared with the much larger sensors in S.L.R. 's ( 1.1 inches , for example ) .
2007_03_01_1829736	28	Another reason : These cameras crank up their own light sensitivity , known as ISO , automatically , in a further effort to reduce blur .
2007_03_01_1829736	29	Unfortunately , extremes in ISO mean extremes in '' noise '' ( grainy speckles ) .
2007_03_01_1829736	30	Check out the sample photos at nytimes.com/technology .
2007_03_01_1829736	31	Not everything about these cameras is identical , however .
2007_03_01_1829736	32	Here 's what makes each one special .
2007_03_01_1829736	33	CANON The PowerShot S3 IS ( $ 338 , 6.0 megapixels ) may be the closest thing you 'll find to a hybrid camcorder and camera .
2007_03_01_1829736	34	You can zoom or change focus while shooting video , a feature that 's extremely rare in digital cameras ; snap a photo while you 're recording ; capture superb stereo sound ; and start recording while still in still-photo mode .
2007_03_01_1829736	35	The movies look fantastic , although a 2-gigabyte card holds only about 18 minutes of video .
2007_03_01_1829736	36	The S3 's screen is tiny by today 's standards : 2 inches .
2007_03_01_1829736	37	On the other hand , it swivels and rotates , like a camcorder 's screen , so you can shoot over your head , down low , and so on .
2007_03_01_1829736	38	To make photographic matters even better , this camera can take 2.3 shots per second in burst mode , and macro shots as close as 0 inches away -- yes , you can photograph things actually touching the lens .
2007_03_01_1829736	39	OLYMPUS In addition to the first-ever 18X zoom lens , the ambitious SP-550UZ ( $ 500 , 7.1 megapixels ) is loaded with unusual goodies .
2007_03_01_1829736	40	Its burst mode can capture incredible numbers of shots per second at lower resolutions -- 7 shots at 3 megapixels each , for example .
2007_03_01_1829736	41	Oddly , if you want full 7-megapixel shots , you get only a slowish one frame per second .
2007_03_01_1829736	42	There 's a super-close-up mode for subjects only half an inch away ; a 2.5-inch screen that brightens up in dim light to help you see what you 're seeing ; and a remarkable on-camera tutorial that teaches you by operating the relevant controls in real time , as you hold the camera .
2007_03_01_1829736	43	The zoom is astounding ( 28 to 504 mm , in film terms ) ; you can practically peer up the nostrils of someone standing at the other end of the football field .
2007_03_01_1829736	44	But the stabilizer is effective only in the brightest light , when you 're doing your best not to breathe or blink .
2007_03_01_1829736	45	The rest of the time , it 's not quite up to ironing out the blur from fully zoomed-in shots .
2007_03_01_1829736	46	The menu design is another disappointment ; it leaves you groping to find your way through that lengthy feature list .
2007_03_01_1829736	47	And then there 's the price tag : $ 500 .
2007_03_01_1829736	48	Discounts will surely kick in once the camera has settled in stores , but another $ 40 could buy you a proper digital S.L.R. ( the Nikon D40 , for example ) , complete with lens and phenomenal results .
2007_03_01_1829736	49	PANASONIC The Lumix DMC-FZ8 ( $ 307 , 7.2 megapixels ) does n't offer any special tricks like the Canon and the Olympus .
2007_03_01_1829736	50	But it 's a consistent performer without any annoying design quirks .
2007_03_01_1829736	51	And no '' 7 megapixels '' logo appears on the camera body ; Panasonic gets points for breaking ranks with its rivals , who still want you to think that more megapixels means better photo quality .
2007_03_01_1829736	52	Standout features include an actual sliding on-off switch ; a rock-bottom price tag ; and the ability to save pictures in RAW format , a rarity among non-S.L.R. 's .
2007_03_01_1829736	53	( RAW-format photos use far more space on your memory card than traditional JPEG files .
2007_03_01_1829736	54	But professionals love RAW files because specialized software can virtually reshoot them with different settings -- after the fact .
2007_03_01_1829736	55	The Olympus offers RAW shooting , too . )
2007_03_01_1829736	56	SONY The first thing you notice on the DSC-H5 ( $ 365 , 7.2 megapixels ) is its huge 3-inch screen , which makes the 2.5-inchers on the others ( and the 2-incher on the Canon ) look undernourished .
2007_03_01_1829736	57	Another bonus is the included set of rechargeable batteries , with charger -- a thoughtful touch .
2007_03_01_1829736	58	Otherwise , alas , there 's not much to write home about on this year-old model .
2007_03_01_1829736	59	Most features work well , but the camera could use some caffeine ; its early-2006 processor is slow , slow , slow .
2007_03_01_1829736	60	Burst mode is only one frame per second ; during playback , pictures appear coarse and take about a second to sharpen up ; the claustrophobic electronic viewfinder can be jittery in low light ; and the recharge time for the flash can take an excruciating 8 seconds .
2007_03_01_1829736	61	If you 're after a midsize superzoom , in other words , you can do much better .
2007_03_01_1829736	62	You could get the Panasonic for its low price and solid design ; the Canon for its remarkable split camera/camcorder personality ; or the Olympus for its mind-boggling zoom .
2007_03_01_1829736	63	You wo n't be slipping any of them into a pants pocket -- but when you bring home that prizewinning shot of the wedding kiss , the soccer goal or the buff-bellied pipit , all will be forgiven .
2007_03_01_1829737	0	Calm returned to Wall Street yesterday .
2007_03_01_1829737	1	Encouraged by comments from Ben S. Bernanke , the chairman of the Federal Reserve , and a bounce-back in the Chinese markets where Tuesday 's global sell-off began , stocks rose modestly in the United States .
2007_03_01_1829737	2	The Dow Jones industrial average , which tumbled as much 545 points on Tuesday , closed yesterday up 52.39 points , or 0.4 percent .
2007_03_01_1829737	3	The Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index closed up 0.56 percent , and the Nasdaq , 0.34 percent .
2007_03_01_1829737	4	Asian and European markets ended the day lower , but the Shanghai market climbed 3.9 percent .
2007_03_01_1829737	5	Shanghai opened slightly lower today .
2007_03_01_1829737	6	[ C4 ] Yet one important concern -- that Wall Street 's bet on home loans to people with weak , or subprime , credit is souring quickly as defaults rise and home prices weaken -- has not gone away .
2007_03_01_1829737	7	Wall Street executives and analysts acknowledged that the subprime segment of the mortgage business has faltered because of the performance of loans issued in 2006 , but many contend that the problems are well contained and do not yet pose a significant threat to investment banks or the broader global financial system .
2007_03_01_1829737	8	Cracks have become more visible lately , however .
2007_03_01_1829737	9	Insurance premiums on the potential default of Wall Street bonds have risen sharply , indicating possible concern among bond traders about potential exposure . ''
2007_03_01_1829737	10	It is impossible to get a number '' on big investment bank 's exposure to subprime loans , said Richard X. Bove , an analyst with Punk Ziegel & Company . ''
2007_03_01_1829737	11	And I do n't think they even know . ''
2007_03_01_1829737	12	The cost of insurance against potential bond default on Bear Stearns 's debt , for example , increased 40 percent recently , from about 22 basis points in mid-January to more than 31 on Tuesday , according to Lehman Brothers data .
2007_03_01_1829737	13	Insurance costs for major firms with exposure to the subprime market , like Lehman Brothers , Morgan Stanley , Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch increased similarly .
2007_03_01_1829737	14	Brad Hintz , an analyst with Sanford Bernstein , said investors are increasingly concerned about Wall Street 's exposure to that market .
2007_03_01_1829737	15	Investors , while heartened yesterday by Mr. Bernanke 's prediction of moderate economic growth , have had a revolving list of concerns : a slowing economy , oil prices and accelerating inflation .
2007_03_01_1829737	16	But now a major concern is whether the problems of subprime lending will spill over into the broader mortgage market , which at $ 6.5 trillion at the end of 2006 is the biggest bond market .
2007_03_01_1829737	17	During the housing boom , Wall Street developed a series of profitable connections to the subprime market that included providing financing to companies that made loans to homeowners , buying finished mortgages , packaging them into bonds and then trading them .
2007_03_01_1829737	18	Last year , the subprime business generated $ 600 billion in loans , about 20 percent of all mortgages written , according to Inside Mortgage Finance .
2007_03_01_1829737	19	While down slightly from 2005 , that is up from $ 120 billion in 2001 .
2007_03_01_1829737	20	Wall Street now faces risks on two fronts .
2007_03_01_1829737	21	First , it stands to earn less from originating , packaging and trading mortgage-backed securities .
2007_03_01_1829737	22	Second , it will have to absorb more of the losses from loans when borrowers are no longer making payments .
2007_03_01_1829737	23	In the past , it could demand that mortgage companies buy back defaulted loans , but such large '' put back '' requests have driven many lenders out of business , and big investment banks are making many more loans through subsidiaries they own .
2007_03_01_1829737	24	As a result , the banks retain more of the risk in the form of '' residual '' interest in the loans they bundle into negotiable securities , a process known as securitization . ''
2007_03_01_1829737	25	The brokerage firms have done something curious : they are not abandoning subprime mortgage origination ; they are taking positions , '' Mr. Hintz said .
2007_03_01_1829737	26	In December , Merrill Lynch completed a $ 1.3 billion acquisition of First Franklin , which was among the 10 biggest subprime lenders last year , and Morgan Stanley bought Saxon Capital for $ 706 million .
2007_03_01_1829737	27	Bank executives say they anticipated the problems in subprime and they have been buying lenders because they want to better control lending standards in the industry . ''
2007_03_01_1829737	28	Saxon was a long-term strategic decision , '' said Anthony Tufariello , who heads the securitized product group at Morgan Stanley . ''
2007_03_01_1829737	29	And we are happy we made that decision because we bought it as a servicing platform with the expectation that the market would undergo dislocation . ''
2007_03_01_1829737	30	And the deal-making continues .
2007_03_01_1829737	31	Citigroup said that it would provide working capital and a credit line to ACC Capital Holdings , which owns Ameriquest and Argent Mortgage .
2007_03_01_1829737	32	Although the terms were not disclosed , it includes an option for Citigroup to acquire Argent , which lends through mortgage brokers .
2007_03_01_1829737	33	By some estimates , the potential risks to the big banks are relatively modest .
2007_03_01_1829737	34	Mr. Hintz , of Sanford Bernstein , calculates that Lehman Brothers had $ 7.3 billion in residual risks at the end of 2006 , $ 2 billion of it in noninvestment grade mortgages .
2007_03_01_1829737	35	If the noninvestment grade residuals decline by 20 percent , Lehman 's earnings would decline 3.2 percent after taking into account compensation costs and taxes ; Bear Stearns 's income would fall about 4.1 percent .
2007_03_01_1829737	36	A Lehman spokeswoman declined to comment on her company 's mortgage business .
2007_03_01_1829737	37	Not all analysts are as sanguine .
2007_03_01_1829737	38	Guy Moszkowski , an analyst with Merrill Lynch , downgraded Goldman Sachs , Bear Stearns and Lehman based on the erosion of risk appetite among its customers and because he believes the problems of subprime lending are spreading to '' Alt-A '' mortgages , which fall between subprime and prime and accounted for about 13 percent of loans written last year .
2007_03_01_1829737	39	Investment banks entered the subprime market because the loans generated high yields , making them popular among pension funds , insurance companies , hedge funds and foreign investors .
2007_03_01_1829737	40	On the other side of the food chain , small mortgage companies and brokers stood ready to feed Wall Street with loans .
2007_03_01_1829737	41	The banks supplied the cash for the loans , and agreed to buy the loans from them .
2007_03_01_1829737	42	The business generated multiple lines of income for Wall Street , including underwriting and trading .
2007_03_01_1829737	43	By 2005 , the residential mortgage-backed securities market was generating 15 percent of fixed income revenues , and the subprime sector was bringing in 3 percent to 4 percent of fixed income revenues , Mr. Hintz said .
2007_03_01_1829737	44	Lehman , RBS Greenwich Capital Markets , Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch were the biggest underwriters of mortgage-backed securities in 2006 , with Lehman controlling 10.7 percent of the market and underwriting $ 51.8 billion worth of mortgage-backed securities , according to Inside Mortgage Finance .
2007_03_01_1829737	45	For some analysts , the bigger risk to Wall Street is simply that the spigot has been turned off . ''
2007_03_01_1829737	46	Does the flow of mortgages to the securitization machine slow ? ''
2007_03_01_1829737	47	asked Jeffrey Harte , an analyst with Sandler O'Neill . ''
2007_03_01_1829737	48	That 's what I 'm most worried about . ''
2007_03_01_1829737	49	Production of nonagency mortgage securities fell almost 50 percent between January and February , according to preliminary numbers compiled by Inside Mortgage Finance .
2007_03_01_1829737	50	The data indicate that new subprime and Alt-A loans fell significantly in February .
2007_03_01_1829737	51	But Wall Street seems to believe it will come out on top , surviving where smaller players lacked the resources . ''
2007_03_01_1829737	52	The economics of the business are moving in favor of well-capitalized entities who do n't have to go outside '' for other services , said Gyan Sinha , who heads asset-backed securities research at Bear Stearns .
2007_03_01_1829737	53	One gauge of the subprime business is an index that tracks bonds backed by subprime loans , the ABX.HE .
2007_03_01_1829737	54	The index for loans issued in 2006 has fallen sharply in two months .
2007_03_01_1829737	55	Its price is used to calculate the cost of insuring the bonds from losses .
2007_03_01_1829737	56	On Tuesday , the cost to insure a low-rated , '' BBB - '' portion of the bonds jumped to nearly $ 1,983 for $ 10,000 of bonds , from $ 1,641 on Monday and $ 410 at the end of December , according to the Markit and CDS IndexCo .
2007_03_01_1829737	57	The index , which was little changed yesterday , tracks the performance of 20 mortgage bonds , or pools , and provides a snapshot of complex market .
2007_03_01_1829737	58	Each mortgage pool is broken into a number of tranches , which carry different risks and rewards for investors .
2007_03_01_1829737	59	Portions rated '' AAA , '' for instance , carry the least risk and provide the smallest return ; investors in these pools also get paid off first when borrowers repay their loans .
2007_03_01_1829737	60	The riskiest portions of the debt , or the residuals , are often held by the mortgage companies that issued the loans or the Wall Street firms that underwrote the bond .
2007_03_01_1829737	61	The big banks ' optimism is based in large part on the structure of these bonds .
2007_03_01_1829737	62	For one thing , most bonds collect more in interest payments than they are obligated to pay out .
2007_03_01_1829737	63	They also include a cash reserve , or residual , that can be dipped into if interest payments fall short because of defaulting borrowers . ''
2007_03_01_1829737	64	You can have a pretty long period of stress before you start to see actual write-downs , '' said Anthony V. Thompson , who heads research of asset-backed securities at Deutsche Bank Securities .
2007_03_01_1829737	65	Much depends on the strength of these bonds ' structure , which is determined largely by agencies like Moody 's Investors Service , Standard & Poor 's and Fitch Ratings .
2007_03_01_1829737	66	Skeptics say that Wall Street 's faith in complexity has proved wrong before , most recently in the meltdown of the manufactured housing , or trailer home , market .
2007_03_01_1829737	67	The business boomed in the early and mid-1990s before collapsing in the late '90s when many buyers of the homes defaulted . ''
2007_03_01_1829737	68	These credit corrections are not unexpected , '' Mr. Thomson said . ''
2007_03_01_1829737	69	What 's harder to predict is the precise moment when the market decides to reprice the risk . ''
2007_03_01_1829738	0	Addressing a skeptical federal judge , Mike Moore , a lawyer who helped engineer a settlement with State Farm , argued Wednesday that the deal should be approved partly because it could put hundreds of millions of dollars into the hands of victims of Hurricane Katrina by the end of the year .
2007_03_01_1829738	1	The alternative , Mr. Moore and other proponents of the settlement told Judge L. T. Senter Jr. of Federal District Court , would be individual trials , which could stretch out several years with the outcomes far from certain . ''
2007_03_01_1829738	2	This is real , '' Mr. Moore said of the settlement . ''
2007_03_01_1829738	3	This is not illusive . ''
2007_03_01_1829738	4	Lawyers involved in the settlement were before Judge Senter on Wednesday to argue the merits of a settlement with State Farm that would reopen 36,000 previously closed claims of Mississippi homeowners whose homes were damaged by the hurricane .
2007_03_01_1829738	5	The central issue has been whether the insurers are responsible for damage caused by extensive flooding .
2007_03_01_1829738	6	The insurers say their policies never provided coverage for any kind of flooding .
2007_03_01_1829738	7	In many cases , storm victims say , the insurers , especially State Farm , refused to pay claims if the damage was done by a combination of wind and water .
2007_03_01_1829738	8	Judge Senter , saying he wanted to learn more about the details of the settlement and to hear from homeowners who have complaints about State Farm , had convened what he called a '' hybrid hearing '' that had some of the flavor of a town meeting .
2007_03_01_1829738	9	At times it was raw and emotional .
2007_03_01_1829738	10	One woman , Sheron Weiss , said she had been so distressed at the loss of her home and the refusal of State Farm to pay her that she had '' contemplated suicide more than once . ''
2007_03_01_1829738	11	The judge , saying he had a duty to protect storm victims , had been unwilling to endorse the settlement because of concerns that it favored State Farm .
2007_03_01_1829738	12	A lawyer for State Farm , W. Scott Welch , a partner in a firm in Jackson , Miss. , said the agreement was a result of '' months of arms-length negotiations . ''
2007_03_01_1829738	13	Some lawyers questioned whether the negotiators for policyholders , led by Richard F. Scruggs , had gone easy on State Farm .
2007_03_01_1829738	14	They pointed out that the settlement was part of a two-part arrangement .
2007_03_01_1829738	15	In the first segment , Mr. Scruggs settled 640 lawsuits against the insurance company for $ 80 million .
2007_03_01_1829738	16	Then , he and the others began negotiating for the reopening of the 36,000 closed claims .
2007_03_01_1829738	17	The deal provides for State Farm to pay a minimum of $ 50 million to the policyholders .
2007_03_01_1829738	18	Some lawyers suggested that Mr. Scruggs was more concerned about the 640 lawsuits than the larger group .
2007_03_01_1829738	19	Mr. Scruggs said , '' We felt we had tilted the playing field greatly in favor of the policyholders . ''
2007_03_01_1829738	20	Mr. Scruggs and Mr. Moore have been friends for years .
2007_03_01_1829738	21	When Mr. Moore was the attorney general in Mississippi , he worked with Mr. Scruggs in the 1990s to start litigation against tobacco companies that led to a $ 248 billion settlement involving 29 states .
2007_03_01_1829738	22	In the negotiations with State Farm , Mr. Moore served as intermediary between Mr. Scruggs 's group , State Farm and the current attorney general , Jim Hood .
2007_03_01_1829738	23	He recently joined the Scruggs team .
2007_03_01_1829738	24	Mr. Scruggs and Mr. Moore estimated that the settlement could result in payments of up to $ 600 million .
2007_03_01_1829738	25	Most of the 36,000 who requested that their claims be reopened , Mr. Moore said , would receive additional money .
2007_03_01_1829738	26	He said he had calculated increases on several individual policies , including those on the homes of two of his sisters .
2007_03_01_1829738	27	During the negotiations , some participants said State Farm insisted upon working out the settlement involving 36,000 policyholders after they had concluded the deal closing the 640 lawsuits .
2007_03_01_1829738	28	The insurer 's concern , participants said , was that once the $ 80 million payment on the lawsuits became public , the 36,000 storm victims might try to overwhelm State Farm with new lawsuits .
2007_03_01_1829738	29	In court on Wednesday , Mr. Moore said that publicity about State Farm 's handling of claims had given it '' a credibility problem '' and he was confident State Farm would pay what arbitrators decided was fair for policyholders .
2007_03_01_1829738	30	Lawyers for State Farm insisted that the company had worked to resolve claims fairly .
2007_03_01_1829738	31	Under the agreement , State Farm will make new offers of payment to those who ask for a review of the claim .
2007_03_01_1829738	32	If the policyholder is not satisfied , the policyholder can request binding arbitration , which will be paid for by the insurance company .
2007_03_01_1829739	0	Seeking to encourage motor fuel production from materials that are cheaper and more abundant than corn , the Energy Department said yesterday that it would provide up to $ 385 million in six bio-refinery projects that would produce cellulosic ethanol , a type of ethanol that can be made from nonfood crops and agricultural waste .
2007_03_01_1829739	1	The awards , to be made over four years , are called for under the 2005 Energy Policy Act .
2007_03_01_1829739	2	They will advance President Bush 's goals of making the cost of cellulosic ethanol competitive with gasoline by 2012 and of reducing America 's gasoline consumption by 20 percent in 10 years , Energy Secretary Samuel W. Bodman said at a news conference in Washington .
2007_03_01_1829739	3	Dozens of ethanol refineries that use corn are planned for construction over the next two years .
2007_03_01_1829739	4	But Mr. Bodman acknowledged yesterday that corn alone would not be enough to achieve the ambitious goal of taming what Mr. Bush has called America 's '' oil addiction . ''
2007_03_01_1829739	5	Because of constraints on farmland and the need for corn in the food supply , corn-based ethanol can produce only up to 15 billion gallons of ethanol , less than half of the 35 billion gallons of renewable and alternative fuels the president set as a goal by 2017 in his State of the Union speech in January . ''
2007_03_01_1829739	6	Corn-based ethanol is already playing a key part in reducing our dependence on fossil fuels and mitigating the growth of greenhouse gases , but we can not increase our use of corn grain indefinitely , '' Mr. Bodman said .
2007_03_01_1829739	7	Ethanol made from corn has a small effect on greenhouse gases , but ethanol from cellulose cuts those gases sharply .
2007_03_01_1829739	8	But cellulosic ethanol is still twice as expensive as corn-based ethanol , which has relied for many years on a 51-cent-a-gallon subsidy to be competitive with gasoline .
2007_03_01_1829739	9	For that reason , no company has yet to construct a commercial-scale cellulosic plant .
2007_03_01_1829739	10	Mike Muston , executive vice president of Broin Companies , which won one of the awards , said Broin could produce cellulosic ethanol for $ 2.25 to $ 2.50 a gallon and expected to cut those costs to under $ 2 a gallon when it started its plant around 2010 .
2007_03_01_1829739	11	Mr. Bodman said the long-range goal was to get costs down to $ 1 a gallon , which he said would put cellulosic ethanol in position to compete with '' any technology in the world . ''
2007_03_01_1829739	12	Yesterday 's grants will help accelerate the nascent cellulosic industry , Mr. Muston said , allowing Broin , which is based in Sioux Falls , S.D. , and its partner , DuPont , to push up construction on an expansion to its Emmetsburg , Iowa , plant by two to three years .
2007_03_01_1829739	13	Lawrence J. Goldstein , an energy consultant and critic of corn-based ethanol , said the administration had no choice but to push hard to commercialize cellulosic ethanol . ''
2007_03_01_1829739	14	They are throwing money where they ought to be throwing it because they know they ca n't get within shouting distance of their goal without a major , quick breakthrough in cellulosic , '' said Mr. Goldstein , a board member at the Energy Policy Research Foundation .
2007_03_01_1829739	15	The awards will finance up to 40 percent of the projects , which are expected to total more than $ 1.2 billion .
2007_03_01_1829739	16	The projects , which are scattered from Florida to Kansas to California , aim to produce more than 120 million gallons of cellulosic ethanol a year .
2007_03_01_1829739	17	The winning companies , in addition to Broin , are a Spanish company , Abengoa Bioenergy ; Alico Inc. , of LaBelle , Fla. ; BlueFire Ethanol , based in Irvine , Calif. ; the Iogen Corporation , of Canada ; and Range Fuels , of Broomfield , Colo. .
2007_03_01_1829739	18	Range Fuels is partly financed by Khosla Ventures , the Silicon Valley venture capital firm run by Vinod Khosla , an influential voice on ethanol in Washington .
2007_03_01_1829739	19	The plants would use low-value materials like switch grass , wheat straw and wood chips .
2007_03_01_1829739	20	Even with the new push by the Energy Department , Mr. Bodman said ethanol 's future was not assured . ''
2007_03_01_1829739	21	We are unclear whether ethanol will be the winner , '' he said yesterday , referring to the search for a renewable energy source to replace petroleum .
2007_03_01_1829739	22	Bio-butanol , a crop-based fuel that is to be commercialized later this year by DuPont and the oil giant BP , '' is an inherently better fuel , '' he said , because , unlike ethanol , it has as much energy for each gallon as gasoline does .
2007_03_01_1829740	0	Who wants to attend a roast when they feel they have been burned on the spit ?
2007_03_01_1829740	1	Duke Coach Gail Goestenkors was hardly in a laughing mood last April after her team suffered the most excruciating of defeats , losing a double-digit lead before falling in overtime to conference rival Maryland in the women 's national championship basketball game .
2007_03_01_1829740	2	Still , making fun of herself provided a needed dose of over-the-counter pain relief .
2007_03_01_1829740	3	So did this advice given at the roast by Kay Yow , the coach at North Carolina State : '' What is delayed is not denied . ''
2007_03_01_1829740	4	There would be other opportunities , Yow suggested , for the Duke women and Goestenkors to win a title after four unrequited trips to the Final Four .
2007_03_01_1829740	5	Despair became possibility . ''
2007_03_01_1829740	6	It made me begin to look forward again and see that it was n't over , '' Goestenkors ( pronounced GUEST-in-kors ) said .
2007_03_01_1829740	7	Duke has not lost since .
2007_03_01_1829740	8	The Blue Devils finished this regular season at 29-0 , advancing to Friday 's game in the Atlantic Coast Conference tournament as the country 's top-ranked team , preserving a chance to become the fifth women 's team to win an N.C.A.A. title in an undefeated season and receiving a belated but growing embrace from the Duke student body .
2007_03_01_1829740	9	Some pundits have suggested that Duke might be better off losing a game in the conference tournament .
2007_03_01_1829740	10	That , without the burden of preserving an unblemished season , the Blue Devils might feel less pressure in the N.C.A.A. tournament .
2007_03_01_1829740	11	To others , this notion seems wrongheaded , perhaps even sexist , suggesting that a women 's team might be too fragile to bear the mantle of perfection . ''
2007_03_01_1829740	12	You never want to lose a game ; not to lose -- that 's the whole point , '' said Duke point guard Lindsey Harding , the A.C.C. 's top player and a favorite to be named the national player of the year .
2007_03_01_1829740	13	In truth , no one expected a faultless season .
2007_03_01_1829740	14	Duke was forecast to finish third in the A.C.C. after losing three seniors , including its leading scorer , Monique Currie .
2007_03_01_1829740	15	But , with one more victory , the Blue Devils would become the first team to win at least 30 games in seven consecutive seasons .
2007_03_01_1829740	16	They have been ranked No. 1 at some point in each of the past five years .
2007_03_01_1829740	17	But the national championship is one banner yet to be unfurled at Cameron Indoor Stadium .
2007_03_01_1829740	18	Of course , these things are not handed out like breath mints .
2007_03_01_1829740	19	Mike Krzyzewski , the men 's coach at Duke , needed five trips to the Final Four before winning the first of his three titles .
2007_03_01_1829740	20	He has counseled Goestenkors not to press , that a championship will come , she said .
2007_03_01_1829740	21	Still , the lack of a title has been a burdensome expectation for Goestenkors .
2007_03_01_1829740	22	Comparisons to Krzyzewski are inevitable .
2007_03_01_1829740	23	She also admits that she previously was self-driven to the point of rigidity .
2007_03_01_1829740	24	Duke players who were not 15 minutes early to meetings were considered late .
2007_03_01_1829740	25	Goestenkors also paced the sideline constantly during games , leaving her critics to say that a nervous coach made for nervous players .
2007_03_01_1829740	26	Her mother made her realize in recent years that she blamed herself too severely in defeat and did not take enough personal satisfaction in victory .
2007_03_01_1829740	27	To her credit , the personable and forthright Goestenkors realized that her attempts to stir her players may have left them tense and hesitant at critical moments .
2007_03_01_1829740	28	So she added softener to her stonewashed approach .
2007_03_01_1829740	29	Five minutes early for meetings is now considered on time .
2007_03_01_1829740	30	This season , and last , Goestenkors has made it a point to sit on the bench instead of kneeling or pacing , allowing her players '' more freedom to make mistakes and decisions on their own . ''
2007_03_01_1829740	31	She has cooked dinner for her team to foster tighter bonds .
2007_03_01_1829740	32	During last year 's N.C.A.A. tournament , Goestenkors wore seashells in her hair one day as a goof on the braided style of one of her players .
2007_03_01_1829740	33	Her point guard , Harding , now refers to her coach simply as G , as if she had the No. 1 hip-hop album instead of the No. 1 basketball team .
2007_03_01_1829740	34	If Goestenkors seems more relaxed , so does her team .
2007_03_01_1829740	35	Duke has yet to trail at the half this season .
2007_03_01_1829740	36	It has calmly rebuilt withered leads and serenely erased late deficits .
2007_03_01_1829740	37	In the regular-season finale last Sunday , the Blue Devils trailed North Carolina , then held the Tar Heels without a field goal for seven minutes down the stretch in an eventual 67-62 victory . ''
2007_03_01_1829740	38	I have n't lost many games at Duke , but the times we have , we played tight , we played passive , '' said Harding , a senior . ''
2007_03_01_1829740	39	This year , in some of these big games , we became more relaxed .
2007_03_01_1829740	40	It 's kind of trickled down from our coach .
2007_03_01_1829740	41	G is more relaxed , calm on the bench .
2007_03_01_1829740	42	It falls to our team .
2007_03_01_1829740	43	That has been a change . ''
2007_03_01_1829740	44	It is as if the loss to Maryland in the 2006 championship game exorcised Duke 's tentative brilliance , replacing it with tranquil and methodical determination .
2007_03_01_1829740	45	The Blue Devils twice defeated Maryland and North Carolina this season and also won at Tennessee .
2007_03_01_1829740	46	Assertiveness has overridden caution , timidity has morphed into certitude , on a team that ranks second nationally in average margin of victory ( 26.2 points ) , points allowed a game ( 50.7 ) and shooting percentage allowed ( 32.7 ) . ''
2007_03_01_1829740	47	We know we can get there , from last year , '' Duke 's 6-foot-7 center , Alison Bales , said of the national championship game . ''
2007_03_01_1829740	48	We 've played everyone out there ; we know what the competition is .
2007_03_01_1829740	49	I think we 're ready for it . ''
2007_03_01_1829740	50	Players , not only Goestenkors , have also been forced into self-evaluation and a new acceptance of responsibility .
2007_03_01_1829740	51	Two years ago , Harding was suspended for a season for a still-undisclosed team violation .
2007_03_01_1829740	52	She remained at the university , buttressed her grades , ran the scout team , sat beside Goestenkors on the bench and learned , as Harding put it , '' to know what she wants before she wants it . ''
2007_03_01_1829740	53	This season , Harding is essentially allowed to call all the plays .
2007_03_01_1829740	54	She has masterfully controlled games with hounding defense ( she is the A.C.C. 's defensive player of the year ) , speed to the basket , an increasingly reliable 3-point shot and the wisdom to get her teammates involved in the offense .
2007_03_01_1829740	55	No Duke player averages more than Harding 's 14.4 points , but seven average at least 5 points . ''
2007_03_01_1829740	56	If Lindsey Harding is n't the player of the year , I want to know who is , '' Maryland Coach Brenda Frese told reporters after Harding scored 28 and 29 points against the Terrapins this season . ''
2007_03_01_1829740	57	She 's stepped up in every big game . ''
2007_03_01_1829740	58	In previous seasons , when stars like Currie and Alana Beard had bounteous scoring averages , other Duke players '' tended to watch a little bit , '' Bales said . ''
2007_03_01_1829740	59	This year everyone is more involved .
2007_03_01_1829740	60	I think we 're a confident team because we 're so confident in each other . ''
2007_03_01_1829740	61	As a freshman , Bales was a reluctant shot-blocker ; as a senior , she leads the nation with 4.5 blocked shots a game .
2007_03_01_1829740	62	Abby Waner , a sophomore guard , was so devastated by the championship-game defeat that Goestenkors instructed her to get away from basketball for a month .
2007_03_01_1829740	63	A self-described perfectionist , Waner now wears the message '' Next Play '' atop her sneakers , a reminder not to become paralyzed by self-criticism after making a mistake .
2007_03_01_1829740	64	She has averaged 13.7 points this season and leads the team with 77 steals .
2007_03_01_1829740	65	Even with such uninterrupted winning , Duke 's student newspaper , The Chronicle , admonished indifferent undergraduates in January to '' show some love for the ladies . ''
2007_03_01_1829740	66	Gradually , support for women 's basketball has increased , especially in a season when the Duke men have faded in and out like an AM radio station .
2007_03_01_1829740	67	Before Sunday 's sold-out victory over North Carolina , students wanting good seats camped for the first time in tents outside Cameron Indoor Stadium , a regular occurrence for men 's games .
2007_03_01_1829740	68	Afterward , a ritualistic bonfire was held on campus and benches were burned in celebration .
2007_03_01_1829740	69	Still , only two women 's games sold out at Cameron this season .
2007_03_01_1829740	70	And because of crowds of 21,118 at Tennessee and 17,950 at Maryland , Duke actually averaged more fans on the road ( 6,787 ) than at home ( 5,852 ) .
2007_03_01_1829740	71	Next season , Goestenkors said , she hopes the women 's team will get its own marketing director .
2007_03_01_1829740	72	It is necessary to '' spend money to make money , '' she said .
2007_03_01_1829740	73	Parity with the men 's team , achieved at Tennessee and Connecticut , remains elusive at Duke .
2007_03_01_1829740	74	Goestenkors 's team does not fly exclusively on charters , as do the Duke men 's team and some other top women 's teams .
2007_03_01_1829740	75	Several years ago , the men 's team declined to hold its annual intrasquad game as part of a doubleheader with the women , a Duke official said . ''
2007_03_01_1829740	76	You sit there like , ` We 're No. 1 , we are undefeated ; why is it just the big games when we can get people to come ? ' ''
2007_03_01_1829740	77	If we get that championship banner , I 'm going to expect more things and more people because it 's like , ` Look what we 've accomplished . '
2007_03_01_1829740	78	Coach K has three .
2007_03_01_1829740	79	So people are going to come .
2007_03_01_1829740	80	We do n't have any yet .
2007_03_01_1829740	81	We get one , I think that 's when a lot more respect will come . ''
2007_03_01_1829740	82	COLLEGE BASKETBALL Correction : March 5 , 2007 , Monday A subheading with the continuation of a sports article on Thursday about the highly regarded Duke women 's basketball program misstated the number of games the team lost last season .
2007_03_01_1829740	83	It was four , not one .
2007_03_01_1829741	0	The Knicks lost Jamal Crawford , but did not lose his personality Wednesday night .
2007_03_01_1829741	1	They were every bit as streaky , unpredictable and maddeningly erratic as their injured starting guard .
2007_03_01_1829741	2	The Knicks were terrible early , superb for a long stretch and then just as quickly a mess again .
2007_03_01_1829741	3	Their first game without Crawford ended in a 102-94 loss to the Boston Celtics at the TD Banknorth Garden .
2007_03_01_1829741	4	An injured ankle will probably sideline Crawford for the rest of the season .
2007_03_01_1829741	5	The Knicks quickly learned how much they might miss him -- and how difficult it might be to make the playoffs without him .
2007_03_01_1829741	6	The offense was stagnant early when the Celtics powered to a 23-point lead .
2007_03_01_1829741	7	Eddy Curry , who feeds off Crawford 's timely entry passes and lobs , never got untracked .
2007_03_01_1829741	8	Quentin Richardson , who slid into Crawford 's spot , scored 24 points and Jared Jeffries , who replaced Crawford in the lineup , had 16 points .
2007_03_01_1829741	9	The wild momentum swings were surely reminiscent of Crawford -- '' definitely his kind of game , '' Curry said with a chuckle -- but there was something unmistakably missing . ''
2007_03_01_1829741	10	It was a different feel out there , '' said Curry , who finished with 16 points and 7 rebounds . ''
2007_03_01_1829741	11	Man , you do n't know how much you miss somebody until they 're gone . ''
2007_03_01_1829741	12	The Knicks did get some good news : Steve Francis intends to practice Thursday and , if all goes well , he could play Friday against Golden State , according to his agent Jeff Fried .
2007_03_01_1829741	13	Francis shut himself down Sunday because of knee tendinitis .
2007_03_01_1829741	14	But he felt better about pushing the knee after undergoing a magnetic resonance imaging exam Wednesday in New York , Fried said .
2007_03_01_1829741	15	The team had no further details .
2007_03_01_1829741	16	David Lee ( ankle ) is also aiming to return for Friday 's game .
2007_03_01_1829741	17	The loss left the Knicks ( 26-33 ) two and a half games out of the playoff field .
2007_03_01_1829741	18	With 24 games left to play , this is not a time to be experimenting with lineups or talking about learning experiences .
2007_03_01_1829741	19	The Knicks have no choice but to do both .
2007_03_01_1829741	20	Crawford , their No. 2 scorer , probably needs surgery .
2007_03_01_1829741	21	Someone else will have to set up Curry and someone else will need to complement Stephon Marbury 's playmaking . ''
2007_03_01_1829741	22	We did n't have another guy attacking , '' Marbury said . ''
2007_03_01_1829741	23	Normally , it 'd be both of us going and attacking and creating for others , whereas it was just myself tonight .
2007_03_01_1829741	24	And then ` Q ' started to attack more in the second half . ''
2007_03_01_1829741	25	The Knicks struggled all night to contain Al Jefferson , the Celtics ' quickly blooming power forward , who finished with 26 points .
2007_03_01_1829741	26	Paul Pierce had 24 points and Gerald Green , the slam-dunk champion , had 21 points , including 4 3-pointers .
2007_03_01_1829741	27	The Knicks turned the game around in the third quarter , when Richardson got assertive .
2007_03_01_1829741	28	He hit 3 3-pointers and had 14 points in the period .
2007_03_01_1829741	29	Boston missed 6 of 7 shots and had a pair of turnovers and the Knicks pounced , with a 22-6 run to open the second half .
2007_03_01_1829741	30	They took their first lead of the night , 81-79 , on a Marbury 3-pointer early in the fourth quarter .
2007_03_01_1829741	31	They had their last lead at 88-87 with 4 minutes 50 seconds to play .
2007_03_01_1829741	32	The Celtics quickly pulled away , with Green scoring 7 points in an 11-2 run .
2007_03_01_1829741	33	Jefferson sealed the victory with a spinning layup around Curry , followed by a jumper over Curry .
2007_03_01_1829741	34	Boston ( 15-42 ) won for just the third time since Jan. 5 , a span of 26 games .
2007_03_01_1829741	35	The Celtics used frequent double teams to deny Curry the ball and stifle him when he got it .
2007_03_01_1829741	36	He got just 4 shots in the first half and Coach Isiah Thomas said the Knicks simply failed to get him sufficient touches . ''
2007_03_01_1829741	37	We were n't as persistent , '' Thomas said , and without Crawford on the court , '' we did n't have enough weapons out on the floor to make them pay . ''
2007_03_01_1829741	38	The Knicks were also missing Nate Robinson , who stayed in New York with an illness , leaving them with three healthy guards , and a severe shortage of shooters to keep the defense honest .
2007_03_01_1829741	39	The Knicks ' starting lineup included two players -- Jeffries and Malik Rose , who are not known for their scoring .
2007_03_01_1829741	40	But the Knicks figured out a few things in the second half , leaving them optimistic they can weather the coming weeks . ''
2007_03_01_1829741	41	I think we 'll have a better understanding now , '' Marbury said of playing without Crawford . ''
2007_03_01_1829741	42	Now that we 've played a game , we have a game under our belt , it will be a lot easier to go out and play a certain style .
2007_03_01_1829741	43	The game has definitely changed without him . ''
2007_03_01_1829741	44	REBOUNDS Isiah Thomas ended the curious Jerome James experiment and instead started Malik Rose at power forward .
2007_03_01_1829741	45	Rose played just 10 minutes , however , finishing with 2 points and 3 fouls .
2007_03_01_1829741	46	Channing Frye started the second half in his place .
2007_03_01_1829741	47	... James , who had started 10 straight games , but rarely after the first quarter , did not play Wednesday .
2007_03_01_1829741	48	... The rookie Mardy Collins was the first , and only , guard off the bench .
2007_03_01_1829741	49	He had 6 points and 5 assists in 25 minutes .
2007_03_01_1829741	50	... The Knicks finished February with a 6-5 record , their first winning month since December 2004 , when they went 9-7 .
2007_03_01_1829741	51	The Knicks have not won more than seven games in a month since then .
2007_03_01_1829741	52	... The Celtics announced that Wally Szczerbiak will have season-ending ankle surgery next week .
2007_03_01_1829743	0	The United States would refuse any demand to give up 26 Central Intelligence Agency operatives ordered to stand trial in Italy on charges of kidnapping a radical Egyptian cleric there in 2003 . ''
2007_03_01_1829743	1	We 've not got an extradition request from Italy , '' John B. Bellinger III , the legal adviser to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , told reporters in Brussels . ''
2007_03_01_1829743	2	If we got an extradition request from Italy , we would not extradite U.S. officials to Italy . ''
2007_03_01_1829743	3	The case is contentious in Italy , reportedly part of the American program called '' extraordinary rendition , '' in which terrorism suspects have been seized outside local laws and taken to third countries for interrogation .
2007_03_01_1829743	4	The cleric , Hassan Mustafa Osama Nasr , was recently released from prison in Egypt .
2007_03_01_1829743	5	He said that American agents took him to Egypt and that he was tortured there .
2007_03_01_1829744	0	The Serbian entity of the government of Bosnia and Herzegovina , the Republika Srpska , officially apologized to victims of the 1992-1995 civil war , two days after international judges in The Hague ruled that Bosnian Serb forces had committed genocide in the killing of nearly 8,000 Muslims in Srebrenica in 1995 . ''
2007_03_01_1829744	1	The government of the Republika Srpska expresses its deepest regret for the crimes committed against non-Serbs and condemns all persons who took part in these crimes , '' the statement said .
2007_03_01_1829745	0	The prosecutor general 's office announced a nationwide investigation of the country 's notoriously , often brazenly , corrupt traffic police .
2007_03_01_1829745	1	In a statement , the office cited complaints by motorists that instances of bribe-taking and other abuses were on the rise despite previously announced campaigns against corruption .
2007_03_01_1829746	0	Gunmen killed four policemen in southeastern Sistan-Baluchestan Province and kidnapped one and took him to Pakistan , Interior Minister Mostafa Pourmohammadi told the ISNA news agency .
2007_03_01_1829746	1	In February , unidentified attackers in the province used a car bomb to kill 11 members of the Revolutionary Guard .
2007_03_01_1829746	2	Officials blame bandits and drug smugglers for the attacks and say they are using Pakistan as a base .
2007_03_01_1829747	0	Bruce C. Ratner , the principal owner of the Nets , said he '' would n't be a happy camper '' if the team were to lose Jason Kidd or Vince Carter , its star players .
2007_03_01_1829747	1	That is why , Ratner said yesterday , he was relieved when neither was traded at last Thursday 's deadline .
2007_03_01_1829747	2	He said he hoped the team would re-sign Carter , who can opt out of the final year of his contract at the end of the season . ''
2007_03_01_1829747	3	I 've come to appreciate both of those players , '' Ratner said during a lunch with several reporters in Manhattan . ''
2007_03_01_1829747	4	I think that it 's very important to sign Vince .
2007_03_01_1829747	5	Without Vince , I 'm not optimistic on how our record would be . ''
2007_03_01_1829747	6	Ratner , determined not to repeat mistakes , said he was willing to open his pocketbook to keep Carter . ''
2007_03_01_1829747	7	If we have to go over the luxury tax , we 'll be over the luxury tax , '' he said . ''
2007_03_01_1829747	8	We 're not going to go way out of market . ''
2007_03_01_1829747	9	In July 2004 , while Ratner and other investors were still trying to complete their purchase of the team , the Nets did not keep power forward Kenyon Martin , who went to the Denver Nuggets in a sign-and-trade deal .
2007_03_01_1829747	10	In the backlash that followed , Kidd and Nets fans questioned the team 's commitment to winning .
2007_03_01_1829747	11	It was not exactly a warm welcome for Ratner , who has taken the blame for the Nets ' letting Martin get away . ''
2007_03_01_1829747	12	When I came on , I do n't think I understood it well enough to have the real intent , '' Ratner said . ''
2007_03_01_1829747	13	Before , I was all concerned about the luxury tax .
2007_03_01_1829747	14	I realize , you know , that at the end of the day we 've got to have a competitive team . ''
2007_03_01_1829747	15	Ratner , who is the development partner of The New York Times Company in a new building for the newspaper 's headquarters , acknowledged that the Nets , with a 28-30 record , were not doing as well as he expected at this point in the season .
2007_03_01_1829747	16	The Nets are in eighth place in the Eastern Conference standings , a half-game behind the Miami Heat and a half-game ahead of the Orlando Magic .
2007_03_01_1829747	17	The top eight teams make the playoffs .
2007_03_01_1829747	18	The Nets , who have won three games in a row , entered the season with title aspirations after easily winning the Atlantic Division last season .
2007_03_01_1829747	19	They trail Toronto by four games for first place in the division .
2007_03_01_1829747	20	As the N.B.A. 's trading deadline approached last week , the Nets considered offers for Kidd and Carter .
2007_03_01_1829747	21	Ratner said that when Rod Thorn , the Nets ' president , talked to him about the possibility of moving Kidd or Carter , he said , '' If you think that 's the right thing to do , let 's go look , see what 's out there , see what the market is . ''
2007_03_01_1829747	22	The Los Angeles Lakers made the strongest bid for Kidd , but they would not include center Andrew Bynum , and that was a deal breaker .
2007_03_01_1829747	23	Ratner , Thorn and Ed Stefanski , the Nets ' general manager , consult on personnel moves .
2007_03_01_1829747	24	Of the decision not to make a trade with the Lakers , Ratner said , '' I think we collectively felt in our gut , no . ''
2007_03_01_1829747	25	Trading Carter or Kidd would have been a sign that the Nets were rebuilding .
2007_03_01_1829747	26	To some , rebuilding seems a logical step for the Nets because they are scheduled to move to Brooklyn by the 2009-10 season .
2007_03_01_1829747	27	The Nets ' new arena will be the centerpiece of Ratner 's $ 4 billion Atlantic Yards project .
2007_03_01_1829747	28	Construction crews have already begun clearing the area for the arena to be built , and Ratner said that the time frame for having the arena ready was '' aggressive , but I think we can do it . ''
2007_03_01_1829747	29	Ratner said that with young players like Richard Jefferson , Nenad Krstic and Marcus Williams , he did not believe that the Nets would be slumping when they moved . ''
2007_03_01_1829747	30	We 're not going to go in there being bad , '' he said . ''
2007_03_01_1829747	31	Sometimes it happens that you have to retool , and it 's never pleasant .
2007_03_01_1829747	32	But we have n't had to do that .
2007_03_01_1829747	33	We 're not going to have to do that , it does n't look like to me . ''
2007_03_01_1829748	0	Ever since Texas lost to Texas A&M earlier this month , talk raged whether the Aggies had supplanted the Longhorns as the state 's top college basketball program .
2007_03_01_1829748	1	After all , Texas A&M has been ranked among the nation 's top 15 teams this season , and youthful Texas has moved in and out of the top 25 .
2007_03_01_1829748	2	Yet as long as the Longhorns have the freshman sensation Kevin Durant , they seem unlikely to relinquish their perch .
2007_03_01_1829748	3	He had 30 points , including 5 of 6 free throws in the final 75 seconds of the second overtime Wednesday night to propel No. 15 Texas past the seventh-ranked Aggies , 98-96 .
2007_03_01_1829748	4	The host Longhorns ( 22-7 , 12-3 Big 12 ) ended the game on a 5-3 run with Durant 's free throws .
2007_03_01_1829748	5	He was 8 of 17 from the field and 10 of 13 from the free-throw line over all , and had 16 rebounds .
2007_03_01_1829748	6	The victory keeps the Longhorns in contention for a share of the conference title and denied Texas A&M ( 24-5 , 12-3 ) its first regular-season sweep of Texas in 20 years .
2007_03_01_1829748	7	It was Texas ' sixth consecutive victory since its loss to the Aggies .
2007_03_01_1829748	8	The Longhorns can earn part of the regular-season title and the No. 1 seeding for the conference tournament by winning Saturday at Kansas .
2007_03_01_1829748	9	If Kansas wins , it would claim the Big 12 title outright .
2007_03_01_1829748	10	The contest went to the first overtime when Texas A&M guard Acie Law made a rainbow 3-pointer over Durant from the left corner with a second left to tie the score at 78-78 .
2007_03_01_1829748	11	Law , who had 33 points and made 10 of 11 free throws , also made a 3-pointer with 25 seconds in the first overtime to tie the score at 88-88 and force a second extra period .
2007_03_01_1829748	12	After Texas A&M ( 24-5 , 12-3 ) cut Texas ' lead to 95-93 , the Longhorns threw the ball away on the subsequent inbound pass .
2007_03_01_1829748	13	After a timeout , Law missed a slashing layup in traffic , and the Aggies fouled Durant .
2007_03_01_1829748	14	He made 1 of 2 free throws with 11 seconds left to put the Longhorns ahead by 96-93 .
2007_03_01_1829748	15	After another timeout and a quick basket by Texas A&M , Durant was fouled again and hit two free throws for a 98-95 lead .
2007_03_01_1829748	16	Law was then fouled with 1.4 seconds left .
2007_03_01_1829748	17	He made the first one , then intentionally missed the second .
2007_03_01_1829748	18	Chinemelu Elonu got the rebound for the Aggies but missed a putback .
2007_03_01_1829748	19	As the Longhorns celebrated , the Aggies somberly exited the court with an exhausted Law pulling his sweat-stained jersey over his head and the Longhorns ' band playing '' Eyes of Texas . ''
2007_03_01_1829748	20	Afterward , the Texas student section chanted , '' Three more years , three more years , '' a reference to Durant 's potentially declaring for the N.B.A. draft after this season .
2007_03_01_1829748	21	One of the teams that could be in position to take him if he declares , the Boston Celtics , was represented at the game by Danny Ainge , who heads their basketball operations .
2007_03_01_1829748	22	After blowing an 11-point lead early in the second half and subsequently trailing by as many as 7 with 10 minutes 6 seconds left , Texas stormed back into contention late .
2007_03_01_1829748	23	After Law missed a jumper , the freshman point guard D. J. Augustin made two free throws with 1:22 left in regulation to give Texas 73-72 advantage .
2007_03_01_1829748	24	On the ensuing possession , Antanas Kavaliauskas had his shot blocked by the Longhorns freshman forward Damion Jones , and the ball lodged between the rim and backboard .
2007_03_01_1829748	25	The ball went to Texas on the possession arrow and set up a N.B.A.-range 3-pointer by Durant for a 76-72 lead with 23 seconds left .
2007_03_01_1829748	26	Starting four freshmen , the Longhorns trailed by as many as 6 points less than 8 minutes into the game after an 8-2 spurt by Texas A&M , which entered the game with three straight victories .
2007_03_01_1829748	27	Texas battled back to take a 28-27 lead on a 3-pointer by Durant with 6:34 left in the first half .
2007_03_01_1829748	28	The Aggies tied the score at 33-33 with less than four minutes left , but the Longhorns used a 10-3 run for a 43-36 lead at halftime .
2007_03_01_1829748	29	Durant opened the second half with a rim-rattling dunk , then blocked Kavaliauskas 's to fuel a 7-0 spurt that upped the Longhorns ' lead to 50-39 with 18:30 left .
2007_03_01_1829748	30	Trailing by as many as 11 points early in the second half , Texas A&M rallied with a 23-5 spurt in almost eight and a half minutes to go ahead , 62-55 .
2007_03_01_1829748	31	It included a 10-0 run in which the sophomore forward Josh Carter scored 8 points .
2007_03_01_1829749	0	NBC 's dominance in television 's evening news race is undergoing its most serious challenge in a decade as '' World News '' on ABC scored its second ratings victory in the last three weeks .
2007_03_01_1829749	1	The figures highlight the slow but steady ascent of the veteran ABC newsman Charles Gibson toward the top position among news anchors .
2007_03_01_1829749	2	In what is being widely interpreted as fallout from the shifting ratings picture , NBC has made plans to replace the executive producer of the network 's '' Nightly News With Brian Williams , '' according to several NBC executives .
2007_03_01_1829749	3	A successor to the current executive producer , John Reiss , may be announced as early as today , the NBC executives said , emphasizing that a change in the newscast had been in the works for several weeks and was not related to the most recent ratings results .
2007_03_01_1829749	4	The NBC executives asked not to be identified because the change had not yet been formally announced .
2007_03_01_1829749	5	The looming change in the control room at '' Nightly News '' and the ratings surge by Mr. Gibson are but the latest developments in the most tumultuous two years in the recent history of broadcast news .
2007_03_01_1829749	6	Mr. Williams succeeded Tom Brokaw in December 2004 .
2007_03_01_1829749	7	After that , Dan Rather resigned as anchor at CBS in the midst of a reporting scandal , and was soon succeeded by Katie Couric .
2007_03_01_1829749	8	Peter Jennings died of lung cancer while still the lead anchor at ABC , and one of Mr. Jennings 's designated successors , Bob Woodruff , nearly died in a roadside bomb explosion in Iraq , setting off a sequence of events that ultimately led to Mr. Gibson 's move to the anchor desk at '' World News . ''
2007_03_01_1829749	9	Only six months before Mr. Gibson got the evening news job , he was effectively passed over for it , in favor of two much younger journalists , making his current run at Mr. Williams 's broadcast all the more remarkable .
2007_03_01_1829749	10	Even as some young viewers forsake television for the Internet , the three network newscasts continue to attract a collective audience of nearly 25 million viewers most nights .
2007_03_01_1829749	11	The programs are also among the most lucrative for the networks , with advertisers planning to spend nearly half a billion dollars on them this year .
2007_03_01_1829749	12	More than a few viewers , and advertisers , choose their broadcast based on the personal strengths of those anchors .
2007_03_01_1829749	13	That has left some people at the networks wondering whether Mr. Gibson -- who , at 63 , is the oldest and most established of the three -- may be proving more attractive to more viewers than Mr. Williams and Ms. Couric .
2007_03_01_1829749	14	One NBC executive who did speak for the record yesterday , Steve Capus , the president of NBC News , would not confirm that any decision had been made about replacing Mr. Reiss .
2007_03_01_1829749	15	But he dismissed any conclusions being drawn from the recent ratings , saying that NBC had experienced surges by ABC during previous special ratings periods , known as sweep months .
2007_03_01_1829749	16	He all but guaranteed that NBC 's anchor , Mr. Williams , would regain supremacy in the ratings in a matter of weeks .
2007_03_01_1829749	17	But the results for Mr. Gibson and ABC over the last month or so certainly present at least the potential that a tipping point may be coming in the evening news competition .
2007_03_01_1829749	18	If ABC 's newscast managed to eclipse NBC on Tuesday and last night by the same margins it has achieved in recent weeks , ABC will probably beat NBC for the entire sweep month of February , in both total viewers and in the chief advertising sales category for news , viewers from the ages of 25 to 54 .
2007_03_01_1829749	19	That would be the first time ABC News had managed that double victory since November 1996 .
2007_03_01_1829749	20	Mr. Gibson 's progress in closing the gap with Mr. Williams had gone largely unnoticed in the initial torrent of attention that accompanied the arrival of the former host of NBC 's '' Today '' show , Ms. Couric , as the anchor of '' CBS Evening News . ''
2007_03_01_1829749	21	Mr. Williams had led the news ratings virtually every week since taking over for Mr. Brokaw , the longtime leader , in December 2004 .
2007_03_01_1829749	22	Mr. Williams 's broadcast remains the most-watched among viewers this television season , drawing about 9.3 million each night , compared with 8.8 million for Mr. Gibson and 7.5 million for Ms. Couric , according to Nielsen Media Research .
2007_03_01_1829749	23	But for the four-week period that began Jan. 29 and ended last Friday , Mr. Gibson 's broadcast was seen by an average of 9.69 million viewers a night , about 43,000 more than the 9.65 million who watched Mr. Williams 's newscast .
2007_03_01_1829749	24	( Ms. Couric 's CBS program trailed at 7.6 million . )
2007_03_01_1829749	25	More notable has been the erosion in Mr. Williams 's lead over the last year .
2007_03_01_1829749	26	Erosion is not uncommon for the network newscasts , which have been steadily losing viewers .
2007_03_01_1829749	27	Still , Mr. Williams has lost an average of a little more than 570,000 viewers over the last year ; Mr. Gibson 's audience has grown by just under 60,000 viewers .
2007_03_01_1829749	28	Ms. Couric 's CBS newscast , which remains a distant third , has lost about 120,000 viewers from the program that was led last year at this time by Bob Schieffer .
2007_03_01_1829749	29	Asked yesterday whether any changes were in the offing for the CBS newscast , Sean McManus , the president of CBS News and Sports , said : '' As we 've said all along , this is a very long process that takes many months , if not years .
2007_03_01_1829749	30	We 're not losing any patience . ''
2007_03_01_1829749	31	Through a network spokesman , Mr. Gibson declined a request to be interviewed yesterday .
2007_03_01_1829749	32	What is perhaps most remarkable about his broadcast 's moving within striking distance of Mr. Williams 's -- and perhaps causing NBC to react by shaking up its newscast 's management -- is that Mr. Gibson is occupying the anchor chair at ABC at all .
2007_03_01_1829749	33	At least twice in the last decade , ABC News marginalized Mr. Gibson 's role to the point that he contemplated leaving the network -- only to have ABC call upon him to rescue a program .
2007_03_01_1829749	34	The first time was in 1998 when , after 11 years as a co-host with Joan Lunden on '' Good Morning America , '' he left the program under pressure from network executives as its ratings sagged well below those of '' Today '' on NBC .
2007_03_01_1829749	35	At the time , he contemplated assuming a part-time role at ABC News , so that he might accept an offer to take a lead role as host of the '' Biography '' series on the A&E Network .
2007_03_01_1829749	36	But less than a year after Mr. Gibson left '' Good Morning America , '' David Westin , the president of ABC News , urged him to reassume his post as co-host of the program , this time alongside Diane Sawyer , after the program sagged further under the anchor team of two neophytes , Lisa McRee and Kevin Newman .
2007_03_01_1829749	37	In April 2005 , after Mr. Jennings took leave of '' World News Tonight , '' as the program was then known , to be treated for lung cancer , Mr. Gibson was one of several anchors ( including Ms. Sawyer and Elizabeth Vargas ) who pinch-hit for him until his death in August 2005 , and then continued to rotate in and out of Mr. Jennings 's empty chair for four months .
2007_03_01_1829749	38	That December , Mr. Westin announced that he had selected Ms. Vargas and Mr. Woodruff , both in their 40s , as a permanent anchor team to succeed Mr. Jennings .
2007_03_01_1829749	39	In an interview on Dec. 5 , the day of the announcement , Mr. Gibson , then 62 , acknowledged that he had , effectively , been passed over for the job .
2007_03_01_1829749	40	At the time , it was widely believed that Mr. Gibson would leave '' Good Morning America , '' and probably ABC , when his contract was up in June 2007 .
2007_03_01_1829749	41	And yet , less than a month after the new anchor team began on '' World News , '' fate again played a hand in Mr. Gibson 's career .
2007_03_01_1829749	42	In late January , Mr. Woodruff was wounded and began a long recuperation .
2007_03_01_1829749	43	The plan for the anchor team was scrapped .
2007_03_01_1829749	44	Mr. Gibson was once again pressed into duty ( as was Ms. Sawyer ) to work with Ms. Vargas behind the anchor desk .
2007_03_01_1829749	45	As for Ms. Vargas , she announced soon afterward that she was pregnant with her second child .
2007_03_01_1829749	46	Last May , Mr. Westin announced that the job of anchor of '' World News '' was now Mr. Gibson 's outright , and that he was leaving '' Good Morning America . ''
2007_03_01_1829749	47	In an interview that day , Mr. Gibson said : '' I am to some extent a creature of circumstance to horrendous events , Peter 's illness and Bob 's injury , and to a joyous event , but nonetheless one that affected all of us , which is the pregnancy for Elizabeth . ''
2007_03_01_1829749	48	On Tuesday night , in a stark reminder of that unsettled period , Mr. Gibson welcomed Mr. Woodruff back to the '' World News '' set , for an unusually long interview that touched on the details of his recovery .
2007_03_01_1829749	49	Jon Banner , the executive producer of '' World News '' for Mr. Gibson ( and Mr. Woodruff and Mr. Jennings before him ) , said : '' To stand there with Charlie and Bob just before the broadcast was a miracle . ''
2007_03_01_1829750	0	Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. , the historian whose more than 20 books shaped discussions for two generations about America 's past and who himself was a provocative , unabashedly liberal partisan , most notably in serving in the Kennedy White House , died last night in Manhattan .
2007_03_01_1829750	1	The cause was a heart attack , said Mr. Schlesinger 's son Stephen .
2007_03_01_1829750	2	He died at New York Downtown Hospital after being stricken in a restaurant .
2007_03_01_1829750	3	Twice awarded the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award , Mr. Schlesinger exhaustively examined the administrations of two prominent presidents , Andrew Jackson and Franklin Delano Roosevelt , against a vast background of regional and economic rivalries .
2007_03_01_1829750	4	He strongly argued that strong individuals like Jackson and Roosevelt could bend history .
2007_03_01_1829750	5	The notes he took for President John F. Kennedy to use in writing his own history , became , after the president 's assassination , grist for Mr. Schlesinger 's own '' A Thousand Days : John F. Kennedy in the White House , '' winner of both the Pulitzer and a National Book Award in 1966 .
2007_03_01_1829750	6	His 1978 book on the president 's brother , '' Robert Kennedy and His Times , '' lauded the subject as the most politically creative man of his time but acknowledged that Robert had played a larger role in trying to overthrow President Fidel Castro of Cuba than the author had acknowledged in '' A Thousand Days . ''
2007_03_01_1829750	7	Mr. Schlesinger worked on both brothers ' presidential campaigns , and some critics suggested he had trouble separating history from sentiment .
2007_03_01_1829750	8	Gore Vidal called '' A Thousand Days '' a political novel , and many noted that the book ignored the president 's sexual wanderings .
2007_03_01_1829750	9	Others were unhappy he told so much , particularly taking the unusual step of asserting that the president was unhappy with his secretary of state , Dean Rusk .
2007_03_01_1829750	10	Mr. Schlesinger saw life as a walk through history .
2007_03_01_1829750	11	He wrote that he could not stroll down Fifth Avenue without wondering how the street and the people on it would have looked a hundred years ago . ''
2007_03_01_1829750	12	He is willing to argue that the search for an understanding of the past is not simply an aesthetic exercise but a path to the understanding of our own time , '' Alan Brinkley , the historian , wrote .
2007_03_01_1829750	13	Mr. Schlesinger wore a trademark dotted bowtie , showed an acid wit and had a magnificent bounce to his step .
2007_03_01_1829750	14	Between marathons of writing as much as 5,000 words a day , he was a fixture at Georgetown salons when Washington was clubbier and more elitist , a lifelong aficionado of perfectly-blended martinis and a man about New York , whether at Truman Capote 's famous parties or escorting Jacqueline Kennedy to the movies .
2007_03_01_1829750	15	In the McCarthy era and beyond , he was a leader of anti-Communist liberals and a fierce partisan who called for the impeachment of Richard M. Nixon , which never happened , and just as passionately denounced that of President Bill Clinton , when it did .
2007_03_01_1829750	16	In his last book , '' War and the American Presidency , '' published in 2004 , Mr. Schlesinger challenged the foundations of the foreign policy of President Bush , calling the invasion of Iraq and its aftermath '' a ghastly mess . ''
2007_03_01_1829750	17	He said the president 's curbs on civil liberties would have the same result as similar actions throughout American history . ''
2007_03_01_1829750	18	We hate ourselves in the morning , '' he wrote .
2007_03_01_1829750	19	However liberal , he was not a slave to what came to be called political correctness .
2007_03_01_1829750	20	He spiritedly defended the old-fashioned American melting pot against proponents of multiculturalism , the idea that ethnicities should retain separate identities and even celebrate them .
2007_03_01_1829750	21	He elicited tides of criticism by comparing Afrocentrism to the Ku Klux Klan .
2007_03_01_1829750	22	History and its telling , quite literally , ran in Mr. Schlesinger 's blood .
2007_03_01_1829750	23	One of his reputed ancestors was George Bancroft , who over 40 years starting in 1834 wrote the monumental 12-volume '' History of the United States from the Discovery of the Continent . ''
2007_03_01_1829750	24	His father , Arthur M. Schlesinger , was an immensely influential historian who led the way in making social history a genuine discipline .
2007_03_01_1829750	25	The son changed his middle name from Bancroft to Meier , his father 's middle name , in his early teens , and began calling himself junior .
2007_03_01_1829750	26	He would later adopt and develop many of his father 's ideas about history , including the theory that history moves in cycles from liberal to conservative periods .
2007_03_01_1829750	27	His father gave him the idea for his Harvard honors thesis .
2007_03_01_1829750	28	But the younger Mr. Schlesinger , for all the tradition he embodied , had a refreshing streak of informality .
2007_03_01_1829750	29	While working in the Kennedy White House , he found time to review movies for Show magazine .
2007_03_01_1829750	30	He also admitted his mistakes .
2007_03_01_1829750	31	One , he said , was neglecting to mention President Jackson 's brutal treatment of the Indians in his Pulitzer Prize-winning '' Age of Jackson . ''
2007_03_01_1829750	32	It was published when he was 27 , and is still standard reading .
2007_03_01_1829750	33	The book rejected earlier interpretations linking the rise of Jacksonian democracy with westward expansion .
2007_03_01_1829750	34	Instead , it gave greater importance to a coalition of intellectuals and workers in the Northeast who were determined to check the growing power of business .
2007_03_01_1829750	35	The book sold more than 90,000 copies in its first year , and won the 1946 Pulitzer Prize for history .
2007_03_01_1829750	36	His multivolume history of the New Deal , '' The Age of Roosevelt , '' began in 1957 with '' The Crisis of the Old Order , 1919-1933 , '' continued in 1959 with '' The Coming of the New Deal '' and culminated in 1960 with '' The Politics of Upheaval . ''
2007_03_01_1829750	37	The first volume won two prestigious awards for history-writing , the Francis Parkman Prize from the Society of American Historians and the Frederic Bancroft Prize from Columbia University .
2007_03_01_1829750	38	The book was praised for capturing the interplay between ideas and action , stressing tensions similar to those Mr. Schlesinger had described in the Jackson era . ''
2007_03_01_1829750	39	This book clearly launches one of the important historical enterprises of our time , '' the historian C. Vann Woodward wrote in The Saturday Review .
2007_03_01_1829750	40	Mr. Schlesinger never stopped seeming like the brightest student in class , '' the eternal Quiz Kid , '' in Time magazine 's phrase .
2007_03_01_1829750	41	He had no advanced degrees but his scholarly output , not to mention reams of articles for popular publications like TV Guide and Ladies ' Home Journal , dwarfed those who did .
2007_03_01_1829750	42	Even as a child he felt a duty to manage conversations , not to say monopolize them .
2007_03_01_1829750	43	An article in The New York Times magazine in 1965 told of his mother asking him to be quiet so she could make her point . ''
2007_03_01_1829750	44	Mother , how can I be quiet if you insist upon making statements that are not factually accurate , '' the boy , then 11 or 12 , replied .
2007_03_01_1829750	45	Arthur Bancroft Schlesinger was born in Columbus , Ohio , on Oct. 15 , 1917 , the elder of the two sons of Arthur Meier Schlesinger and the former Elizabeth Bancroft .
2007_03_01_1829750	46	The younger Mr. Schlesinger wrote approvingly that Bancroft the historian , his mother 's ancestor , was a presidential ghostwriter and bon vivant in addition to being called the father of American history .
2007_03_01_1829750	47	It was his father whom '' young Arthur , '' as he was known , idolized .
2007_03_01_1829750	48	His argument that urban labor was behind much of the upheaval in Jackson 's time was taken up and brilliantly expanded by his son .
2007_03_01_1829750	49	The younger Schlesinger in the first volume of his memoirs , '' A Life in the Twentieth Century : Innocent Beginnings , 1917-1950 '' ( 2000 ) , called his childhood '' sunny . ''
2007_03_01_1829750	50	He spent his earliest years in Iowa City , where his father was on the faculty of the University of Iowa .
2007_03_01_1829750	51	The family moved to Cambridge , Mass. , in 1924 , when his father was appointed to the Harvard faculty .
2007_03_01_1829750	52	Arthur Sr. later became chairman of the Harvard history department .
2007_03_01_1829750	53	Young Arthur first attended public schools in Cambridge , but his parents lost faith in public education in his sophomore year after a civics teacher informed Arthur 's class that inhabitants of Albania were called Albinos and had white hair and pink eyes .
2007_03_01_1829750	54	He was shipped to the Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire .
2007_03_01_1829750	55	He graduated at 15 , but the family felt he was too young to go to Harvard .
2007_03_01_1829750	56	So , while his father was on sabbatical , the whole family took a long trip around the world .
2007_03_01_1829750	57	Mr. Schlesinger then went on to Harvard and graduated summa cum laude in 1938 .
2007_03_01_1829750	58	From boyhood he socialized with his father 's intellectually powerful friends , from the humorist James Thurber to the novelist John Dos Passos .
2007_03_01_1829750	59	When he was 14 , he met H. L. Mencken , and later corresponded with him .
2007_03_01_1829750	60	At Harvard , he knew such leading intellectual lights as the historian Samuel Eliot Morison .
2007_03_01_1829750	61	Mr. Schlesinger later became part of the powerful circle surrounding the journalist Joseph Alsop , a group that included Philip Graham , publisher of The Washington Post , W. Averill Harriman , former governor of New York , and the lawyer Clark Clifford .
2007_03_01_1829750	62	Mr. Schlesinger met Mr. Kennedy , then a senator , at an Alsop soiree .
2007_03_01_1829750	63	His impression : '' Kennedy seemed very sincere and not unintelligent , but kind of on the conservative side . ''
2007_03_01_1829750	64	Mr. Schlesinger , partly through his appreciation of history , fully realized his good fortune . ''
2007_03_01_1829750	65	I have lived through interesting times and had the luck of knowing some interesting people , '' he wrote .
2007_03_01_1829750	66	A huge part of his luck was his father , who guided much of his early research , and even suggested the topic for his senior honors : Orestes A. Brownson , a 19th-century journalist , novelist and theologian .
2007_03_01_1829750	67	It was published by Little , Brown in 1938 as '' Orestes A. Brownson : A Pilgrim 's Progress . ''
2007_03_01_1829750	68	Henry Steele Commager in The New York Times Book Review , said the book introduced '' a new and distinguished talent in the field of historical portraiture . ''
2007_03_01_1829750	69	Mr. Schlesinger spent a year at Peterhouse College of Cambridge University on a fellowship and returned to Harvard , where he had been selected to be one of the first crop of junior fellows .
2007_03_01_1829750	70	Their research was supported for three years , but they were not allowed to pursue Ph.D. 's , a requirement intended to keep them off the standard academic treadmill .
2007_03_01_1829750	71	While a fellow , Mr. Schlesinger married Marian Cannon , whom he had met during his junior year at Harvard .
2007_03_01_1829750	72	Her sister was married to John King Fairbank , the eminent sinologist .
2007_03_01_1829750	73	The Schlesingers had twins , Stephen and Katharine , and two more children , Christina and Andrew .
2007_03_01_1829750	74	Katharine died in 2004 .
2007_03_01_1829750	75	The Schlesingers were divorced in 1970 .
2007_03_01_1829750	76	He married Alexandra Emmet the next year .
2007_03_01_1829750	77	They had a boy , Robert , named for Robert F. Kennedy .
2007_03_01_1829750	78	She had a son from a previous marriage , Peter Allan .
2007_03_01_1829750	79	Mr. Schlesinger is survived by all three , in addition to his former wife and their three surviving .
2007_03_01_1829750	80	As a fellow , Mr. Schlesinger managed to pound out 4,000 to 5,000 words a day on the Jackson work as his year-old twins frolicked around his desk .
2007_03_01_1829750	81	His work on the book was interrupted by World War II .
2007_03_01_1829750	82	Bad eyesight precluded his serving in the military , so he got a job as a writer for the Office of War Information .
2007_03_01_1829750	83	One assignment was writing a message from President Roosevelt to the Daughters of the American Revolution .
2007_03_01_1829750	84	Mr. Schlesinger doubted the president saw such masterpieces .
2007_03_01_1829750	85	He next served in the Office of Strategic Planning , forerunner of the Central Intelligence Agency , in Washington , London and Paris .
2007_03_01_1829750	86	Immediately after the war , Mr. Schlesinger went to Washington as a freelance journalist for Fortune and other magazines .
2007_03_01_1829750	87	After 15 months , in 1946 , he accepted an associate professorship at Harvard .
2007_03_01_1829750	88	He said he was so nervous teaching that he vomited before each class ; eventually his presentation became so deft that his History 169 course was the department 's most popular offering .
2007_03_01_1829750	89	He began to carve out a political identity , one committed to the social goals of the New Deal and staunchly anti-Communist .
2007_03_01_1829750	90	In 1947 , he was a founder of the Americans for Democratic Action , the best-known liberal pressure group .
2007_03_01_1829750	91	In 1949 , Mr. Schlesinger solidified his position as the spokesman for postwar liberalism with his book '' The Vital Center : The Politics of Freedom . ''
2007_03_01_1829750	92	Inspired by the Protestant theologian Reinhold Niebuhr , he argued that pragmatic , reform-minded liberalism , limited in scope , was the best that man could hope for politically . ''
2007_03_01_1829750	93	Problems will always torment us , '' he wrote , '' because all important problems are insoluble : that is why they are important .
2007_03_01_1829750	94	The good comes from the continuing struggle to try and solve them , not from the vain hope of their solution . ''
2007_03_01_1829750	95	Starting with writing speeches for Adlai Stevenson in both his presidential campaigns , Mr. Schlesinger was a player in big-time Democratic politics .
2007_03_01_1829750	96	Even though Senator Barry Goldwater tried to have him fired from the Kennedy White House because of his liberal bias , one of Mr. Goldwater 's colleagues paid Mr. Schlesinger something of a compliment .
2007_03_01_1829750	97	As quoted anonymously in '' The Making of the President , 1964 '' by Theodore H. White , the Goldwater associate said : '' At least you got to say this for a liberal s.o.b. like Schlesinger -- when his candidates go into action , he 's there writing speeches for them . ''
2007_03_01_1829750	98	One of his major contributions to the Kennedy campaign was a book , '' Kennedy or Nixon : Does It Make Any Difference ? ''
2007_03_01_1829750	99	Under Nixon , the book concluded , the country would '' sink into mediocrity and cant and payola and boredom . ''
2007_03_01_1829750	100	Kennedy meant rising to '' the splendor of our ideals . ''
2007_03_01_1829750	101	On Jan. 9 , 1961 , a gray , chilly , afternoon , President-elect Kennedy dropped by Mr. Schlesinger 's house on Irving Street in Cambridge .
2007_03_01_1829750	102	He asked the professor to be a special assistant in the White House .
2007_03_01_1829750	103	Mr. Schlesinger answered , '' If you think I can help , I would like to come . ''
2007_03_01_1829750	104	In '' Johnny , We Hardly Knew Ye , '' ( 1970 ) Kenneth P. O'Donnell and David F. Powers suggest that the new president saw some political risk in hiring such an unabashed liberal .
2007_03_01_1829750	105	He decided to keep the appointment quiet until another liberal , Chester Bowles , was confirmed as under secretary of state .
2007_03_01_1829750	106	The authors , both Kennedy aides , said they asked Mr. Kennedy if he took Mr. Schlesinger on to write the official history of the administration .
2007_03_01_1829750	107	Mr. Kennedy said he would write it himself . ''
2007_03_01_1829750	108	But Arthur will probably write his own , '' the president said , '' and it will be better for us if he 's in the White House , seeing what goes on , instead of reading about it in The New York Times and Time magazine . ''
2007_03_01_1829750	109	Time later described Mr. Schlesinger 's role in the Kennedy administration as a bridge to the intelligentsia as well as to the Adlai Stevenson-Eleanor Roosevelt wing of the Democratic Party .
2007_03_01_1829750	110	If the president wanted to meet the intellectual Isaiah Berlin or the composer Gian Carlo Menotti , Mr. Schlesinger arranged it .
2007_03_01_1829750	111	The president was said to enjoy Mr. Schlesinger 's gossip during weekly lunches , although he rarely attended the brainy seminars Robert Kennedy asked Mr. Schlesinger to organize .
2007_03_01_1829750	112	Mr. Schlesinger distinguished himself early in the administration by being one of the few in the White House to question the invasion of Cuba planned by the Eisenhower administration .
2007_03_01_1829750	113	But he then became a loyal soldier , telling reporters a misleading story that the Cuban exiles landing at the Bay of Pigs were no greater than 400 when in fact they numbered 1,400 .
2007_03_01_1829750	114	In a discussion of that ill-fated action afterward , McGeorge Bundy , the national security adviser , reminded the president that Mr. Schlesinger had written a memo opposing the invasion . ''
2007_03_01_1829750	115	That will look pretty good when he gets around to writing his book about my administration , '' Mr. Kennedy said . ''
2007_03_01_1829750	116	Only he better not publish that memorandum while I 'm still alive . ''
2007_03_01_1829750	117	After President Kennedy was assassinated , President Lyndon B. Johnson kept Mr. Schlesinger on but gave him virtually nothing to do .
2007_03_01_1829750	118	He resigned in January 1964 .
2007_03_01_1829750	119	Mr. Schlesinger soon wrote an article saying that John Kennedy had not really wanted Mr. Johnson as his vice-presidential candidate , but had picked him for political reasons .
2007_03_01_1829750	120	Mr. Schlesinger , who resigned from Harvard when his leave of absence expired in 1962 , worked on his Kennedy book and for the first few months of 1966 was at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton , N.J. .
2007_03_01_1829750	121	He then joined the faculty of the City University of New York as Albert Schweitzer Professor of the Humanities .
2007_03_01_1829750	122	He settled in Manhattan , where he remained until his death .
2007_03_01_1829750	123	His visibility was high -- from the society pages to the column he wrote for the Op-Ed page of The Wall Street Journal to television appearances .
2007_03_01_1829750	124	He continued to protect the Kennedy image , despite steady disclosures that smudged it .
2007_03_01_1829750	125	In 1996 , he angered conservatives by selecting historians for a poll that found Presidents Kennedy and Johnson had been '' high average '' presidents and President Ronald Reagan '' low average . ''
2007_03_01_1829750	126	His writing was ceaseless , including the book and articles criticizing the Iraq war .
2007_03_01_1829750	127	In '' The Imperial Presidency '' ( 1973 ) , he argued that President Richard M. Nixon had so magnified the powers of the president that he must be impeached .
2007_03_01_1829750	128	In a review , Jeane Kirkpatrick , the former ambassador to the United Nations under Reagan , retorted that Mr. Schlesinger had applied different standards to Democratic presidents .
2007_03_01_1829750	129	In 1978 , Mr. Schlesinger scored a literary and commercial triumph with '' Robert Kennedy and His Times . ''
2007_03_01_1829750	130	In The New York Times Book Review , Garry Wills , who had once called Mr. Schlesinger '' a Kennedy courtier , '' rated the work '' learned and thorough . ''
2007_03_01_1829750	131	It won a National Book Award .
2007_03_01_1829750	132	In the book , Mr. Schlesinger compared the brothers : '' John Kennedy was a realist brilliantly disguised as a romantic , Robert Kennedy , a romantic stubbornly disguised as a realist . ''
2007_03_01_1829750	133	Mr. Schlesinger had hoped that Robert would ignite a new spirit of liberalism but grew disappointed when Jimmy Carter rose to lead the party in 1976 .
2007_03_01_1829750	134	He considered Mr. Carter woefully conservative and did not vote for him in either of his campaigns .
2007_03_01_1829750	135	He worked for Senator Edward M. Kennedy in his brief presidential campaign in 1980 .
2007_03_01_1829750	136	In 1991 , Mr. Schlesinger provoked a backlash with '' The Disuniting of America , '' an attack on the emergent '' multicultural society '' in which he said Afrocentrists claimed superiority and demanded that their separate identity be honored by schools and other institutions .
2007_03_01_1829750	137	The novelist Ishmael Reed denounced Mr. Schlesinger as a '' follower of David Duke , '' the former Ku Klux Klan leader .
2007_03_01_1829750	138	The Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. caricatured Mr. Schlesinger 's arguments as a demand for '' cultural white-face . ''
2007_03_01_1829750	139	Mr. Schlesinger was nonplussed .
2007_03_01_1829750	140	He frequently described himself as an unreconstructed New Dealer whose basic thinking had changed little in a half-century . ''
2007_03_01_1829750	141	What the hell , '' he answered when questioned by The Washington Post about his attack on multiculturalism . ''
2007_03_01_1829750	142	You have to call them as you see them .
2007_03_01_1829750	143	This too shall pass . ''
2007_03_01_1829750	144	Mr. Schlesinger continued to write articles , sign petitions and in 2006 received an award from the National Portrait Gallery for his presidential service .
2007_03_01_1829750	145	His failing health prevented him from attending the funeral of his good friend John Kenneth Galbraith that May .
2007_03_01_1829750	146	Mr. Schlesinger 's son Stephen read some words he had written about Mr. Galbraith : '' Underneath his joy in combat , he was a do-gooder in the dark of night . ''
2007_03_01_1829750	147	Correction : March 8 , 2007 , Thursday An obituary about the historian Arthur M. Schlesinger in some copies last Thursday , and in early-edition copies the next day , misstated the publication year of '' Johnny , We Hardly Knew Ye , '' a book about President John F. Kennedy by Kenneth P. O'Donnell and David F. Powers , who wrote that President Kennedy saw some political risk in hiring Mr. Schlesinger , an ardent liberal , as an adviser .
2007_03_01_1829750	148	It was published in 1972 , not 1970 .
2007_03_01_1829750	149	The obituary last Thursday also misstated the name of a federal agency that Mr. Schlesinger worked for during World War II .
2007_03_01_1829750	150	It was the Office of Strategic Services , a forerunner of the Central Intelligence Agency ; it was not the Office of Strategic Planning .
2007_03_01_1829750	151	It also misspelled the middle name of a former governor of New York who , with Mr. Schlesinger , was part of a powerful circle surrounding the journalist Joseph Alsop .
2007_03_01_1829750	152	He was W. Averell Harriman , not Averill .
2007_03_01_1829750	153	The obituary on Thursday also referred imprecisely at one point to the relationship of the 19th-century historian George Bancroft to Mr. Schlesinger 's mother , the former Elizabeth Bancroft .
2007_03_01_1829750	154	Although Mr. Bancroft was believed to be an ancestor of hers , there is no definitive evidence that they were related .
2007_03_01_1829750	155	And the obituary omitted the last word in a paragraph about Mr. Schlesinger 's survivors .
2007_03_01_1829750	156	Referring to his wife , son and stepson , it should have read : '' Mr. Schlesinger is survived by all three , in addition to his former wife and their three surviving children . ''

2007_03_01_1829752	0	When Yusef Johnson , a 15-year-old honors student , was killed outside an apartment complex here so gang-infested it is known as Crazyville , a witness came forward within days and told the police she knew the man she had seen fire the fatal shots .
2007_03_01_1829752	1	In another case three months later , in November 2005 , officers found two people who identified a street gang leader as the man they saw kill a marijuana dealer named Valterez Coley during a dispute over a woman .
2007_03_01_1829752	2	And when Isaiah Stewart , a 17-year-old wearing an electronic monitoring bracelet from a recent brush with the law , was gunned down that December , another Newark teenager sketched a diagram of the crime scene , correctly identified the murder weapon and named a former classmate as the person he had watched commit the crime .
2007_03_01_1829752	3	They seem like slam-dunk cases , but none of the three suspects have been arrested .
2007_03_01_1829752	4	It is not that detectives are unsure of their identity or can not find them .
2007_03_01_1829752	5	Rather , it is because so many recent cases here have been scuttled when witnesses were scared silent that the Essex County prosecutor has established an unwritten rule discouraging pursuit of cases that rely on a single witness , and those in which witness statements are not extensively corroborated by forensic evidence .
2007_03_01_1829752	6	The 3 are among at least 14 recent murders in Newark in which witnesses have clearly identified the killers but no charges have been filed , infuriating local police commanders and victims ' relatives .
2007_03_01_1829752	7	In 8 of the 14 cases , according to court documents and police reports , there was more than one witness ; in two of them , off-duty police officers were among those identifying the suspects .
2007_03_01_1829752	8	But in a DNA era , these are cases with little or no physical evidence , and they often involve witnesses whose credibility could be compromised by criminal history or drug problems , or both . ''
2007_03_01_1829752	9	No one wants to solve these cases and lock up the killers in these cases more than we do , '' the county prosecutor , Paula T. Dow , said in a recent interview . ''
2007_03_01_1829752	10	But we have to weigh the evidence and move forward only if we believe that the witnesses are credible and that they 'll be there to testify at trial . ''
2007_03_01_1829752	11	The tension between the police and prosecutors here over the evolving standards of evidence required to authorize arrest warrants is a stark example of the profound effect witness intimidation is having on the criminal justice system in New Jersey and across the country .
2007_03_01_1829752	12	Surveys conducted by the National Youth Gang Center , which is financed by the federal Department of Justice , have found that 88 percent of urban prosecutors describe witness intimidation as a serious problem .
2007_03_01_1829752	13	In both Baltimore and Boston , where '' stop snitching '' campaigns by rap artists and gang leaders have urged city residents not to cooperate with the authorities , prosecutors estimate that witnesses face some sort of intimidation in 80 percent of all homicide cases .
2007_03_01_1829752	14	In Essex County , prosecutors report that witnesses in two-thirds of their homicides receive overt threats not to testify , with defendants and their supporters sometimes canvassing witnesses ' neighborhoods wearing T-shirts printed with the witnesses ' photographs or distributing copies of their statements to the police .
2007_03_01_1829752	15	Dozens of New Jersey murder cases have been undone over the past five years after witnesses were killed , disappeared before trial or changed their stories .
2007_03_01_1829752	16	In 2004 , the Newark police determined that four people found dead in a vacant lot had been killed to silence a witness to a murder ; a witness to that quadruple homicide was later shot to death as well .
2007_03_01_1829752	17	Ms. Dow , who was appointed in 2003 amid criticism of county prosecutors ' ability to close cases , said she was simply adapting to the evolving code on the streets , where gang violence and widespread distrust of law enforcement have deprived prosecutors of one of the legal system 's most crucial components : dependable witnesses .
2007_03_01_1829752	18	The state 's attorney in Baltimore , where witness intimidation is a notorious problem , has taken an even more rigid stand , refusing to file charges in any single-witness case without extensive forensic corroboration .
2007_03_01_1829752	19	But that approach differs sharply from those of prosecutors in many other urban areas , like Brooklyn , where the district attorney , Charles J. Hynes , has in recent years taken to reviewing all single-witness cases personally .
2007_03_01_1829752	20	In Newark , where the homicide rate has risen in the past few years , the police , local politicians and victims ' relatives are all questioning why prosecutors are holding detectives to a higher standard than the law requires -- and letting dangerous criminals remain on the streets . ''
2007_03_01_1829752	21	How can they leave him out there ? ''
2007_03_01_1829752	22	asked Yusef 's mother , Tosha Braswell , referring to the man who shot him . ''
2007_03_01_1829752	23	Are they waiting for him to kill someone else 's son ? ''
2007_03_01_1829752	24	Tension Between Officials Newark 's mayor , Cory A. Booker , who was elected last year on a promise to reduce crime in the city , recently met with Ms. Dow to ask her to be more aggressive in filing charges .
2007_03_01_1829752	25	In recent years Newark police officials have accused the prosecutor of being reluctant to take on cases that could be difficult to win because her office was criticized after losing a succession of high-profile trials .
2007_03_01_1829752	26	The police director , Garry F. McCarthy , worries that the prosecutor 's approach undermines his crime-fighting strategy of focusing on the small group of criminals responsible for a disproportionate amount of crime . ''
2007_03_01_1829752	27	The law states the standard for arrest is probable cause , which is different than what is required for conviction beyond a reasonable doubt , '' Mr. McCarthy said . ''
2007_03_01_1829752	28	Our goal is to arrest quickly to avoid the potential for additional crime .
2007_03_01_1829752	29	An arrest does not prevent an ongoing investigation from proceeding . ''
2007_03_01_1829752	30	Ms. Dow declined to discuss details of any open cases .
2007_03_01_1829752	31	But she said that she was proud of her office 's performance , and that she hoped her rigorous standards for filing charges would lead investigators to work harder at getting corroboration . ''
2007_03_01_1829752	32	It 's easy for the police to point fingers when they have n't done enough detective work to get a conviction , '' she said .
2007_03_01_1829752	33	In Essex County , the conviction rate for homicides , which includes plea agreements , was 79 percent in 2006 , up from 74 percent when Ms. Dow took over three years earlier ( but down from 86 percent in 2005 and 83 percent in 2004 ) .
2007_03_01_1829752	34	In Baltimore , prosecutors under Patricia C. Jessamy , the state 's attorney , obtained convictions in 65 percent of homicide cases last year , up from 59 percent in 2005 and 52 percent in 2004 .
2007_03_01_1829752	35	While prosecutors are often measured by such conviction rates , it is difficult to tell through statistics whether they are shying from hard-to-win cases .
2007_03_01_1829752	36	What most irks the police is the failure to even file charges in cases in which witnesses have solidly identified a suspect , like the 14 here in Newark over the past three years in which Ms. Dow has declined to authorize arrest warrants .
2007_03_01_1829752	37	Six of these cases rely on a single witness , including the slayings of Yusef Johnson and Valterez Coley .
2007_03_01_1829752	38	Yusef was a football star with a 3.7 grade-point average before he was killed in August 2005 .
2007_03_01_1829752	39	According to police reports , a woman told detectives she had seen the shooting from 30 feet away and was well acquainted with the gunman , a member of the Crips street gang , because he frequently sold cocaine to her .
2007_03_01_1829752	40	The case helps illustrate why prosecutors may shy away from single-witness cases : Given the suspect 's status as both a gang member and the witness 's drug supplier , even detectives have their doubts about whether the woman would ultimately testify at trial -- or be believed .
2007_03_01_1829752	41	On the night Mr. Coley was gunned down near a porch in Newark 's Central Ward , two men told the police they had seen the gunman , whom they identified as a leader of the 252 Bloods street gang .
2007_03_01_1829752	42	The witnesses said the gunman was looking to settle a score with a young man who had a relationship with his girlfriend , and mistook Mr. Coley for his rival .
2007_03_01_1829752	43	But one of the men soon fled the state , leaving the police with a lone witness -- and thus no charges have been brought .
2007_03_01_1829752	44	Danger in Cooperation Gregory DeMattia , chief of the Essex County prosecutor 's homicide division , said his investigators saw fallout from witness intimidation every day .
2007_03_01_1829752	45	When they arrive at a crime scene , he said , bystanders scatter so neighbors will not think they are cooperating with the police .
2007_03_01_1829752	46	Those who do help often do so surreptitiously -- leaving detectives a note in a trash can or asking to be taken away in handcuffs '' so that neighbors will think they 're in trouble with the police and not cooperating , '' Mr. DeMattia said .
2007_03_01_1829752	47	Prosecutors in other cities tell similar stories about their witnesses being pressured , and say they are cautious about pursuing cases based on lone witnesses because of worries about faulty memory , ulterior motives and , as in the Yusef Johnson case , credibility .
2007_03_01_1829752	48	That is part of why Ms. Jessamy , in Baltimore , has all but refused to file charges in single-witness situations .
2007_03_01_1829752	49	But across Maryland in Prince George 's County , where there is also a serious gang problem , State 's Attorney Glenn F. Ivey has taken the opposite tack .
2007_03_01_1829752	50	He insists on pursuing single-witness cases even though he was criticized publicly for losing 4 of them in 13 months . ''
2007_03_01_1829752	51	If you have a single witness and you believe their story , I believe you 've got to go forward , even if it 's a case you might lose , '' said Mr. Ivey , whose office 's conviction rate on homicides is more than 80 percent . ''
2007_03_01_1829752	52	I 'm not going to give the gang members , the murderers and the rapists an easy out .
2007_03_01_1829752	53	And if they know that all they have to do is get your case down to one witness , I think it would encourage them to use even more intimidation . ''
2007_03_01_1829752	54	Here in Newark , even in cases with multiple witnesses -- and occasionally even when one of those witnesses is a police officer -- the prosecutor has sometimes been unwilling to authorize arrests .
2007_03_01_1829752	55	Take the case of Lloyd Shears , an Army veteran killed during a robbery in December .
2007_03_01_1829752	56	A man told the police he had seen his neighbor fire the fatal shots .
2007_03_01_1829752	57	A woman who had been standing next to him told detectives she heard the shots , and then turned to see the neighbor running from the scene .
2007_03_01_1829752	58	But the neighbor has not been charged .
2007_03_01_1829752	59	Or consider the killing of Shamid Wallace , an 18-year-old found face down in the street last August with several gunshot wounds in his torso .
2007_03_01_1829752	60	Detectives found two witnesses who identified the man they said they saw kill Mr. Wallace .
2007_03_01_1829752	61	An off-duty Newark police officer heard the gunshots , saw a man fleeing with a gun and later picked the suspect out of a photo array .
2007_03_01_1829752	62	The suspect has not been arrested .
2007_03_01_1829752	63	Then there is Farad Muhammad , who was stabbed to death last July .
2007_03_01_1829752	64	One witness told the police she had seen someone she knew running away from Mr. Muhammad 's body .
2007_03_01_1829752	65	An off-duty police officer from neighboring East Orange identified the same man , saying he had seen the suspect chasing Mr. Muhammad with a knife .
2007_03_01_1829752	66	Again , no charges were filed .
2007_03_01_1829752	67	Yusef 's parents , who keep a shrine of photographs surrounding his school sports trophies , still hope that his suspected killer will be arrested soon . ''
2007_03_01_1829752	68	It 's like they do n't care enough , '' said his father , Scottie Edwards , a delivery truck driver .
2007_03_01_1829752	69	Wielding Fear Like a Weapon But to those who suggest Ms. Dow is overreacting to the problem of witness intimidation , her supporters point to the death of Steven Edwards , who was shot and killed in a car on South Eighth Street in January 2006 .
2007_03_01_1829752	70	Within a month , detectives had three witnesses identifying the gunman .
2007_03_01_1829752	71	One of the witnesses , a gang member , quickly announced he would never testify for fear he would be ostracized for helping the police -- or wind up murdered himself .
2007_03_01_1829752	72	Six months later , another witness was himself charged in two homicides , shattering any credibility .
2007_03_01_1829752	73	The third witness picked the suspect out of a photo array , but immediately began to waver when asked about testifying in open court . ''
2007_03_01_1829752	74	She would not say she was 100 percent sure , '' said a police report on the case , '' because she was afraid of retaliation . ''

2007_03_01_1829756	0	Facing a possible revolt by state officials and a Senate effort to modify the law , Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said the federal government would not penalize states that could not meet a May 2008 deadline to start issuing new standardized and tamper-proof driver 's licenses .
2007_03_01_1829756	1	Mr. Chertoff said the department would be prepared to grant waivers , as current law allows .
2007_03_01_1829756	2	Without the waivers , drivers from states that did not comply with the law risked being told that their licenses would not be valid identification at airport checkpoints or federal buildings .

2007_03_01_1829757	0	A question sent to the judge by the jury that is deciding the perjury case of I. Lewis Libby Jr. created a stir but did not provide any clarity about the status of the deliberations .
2007_03_01_1829757	1	The message was received late Tuesday , after the jury had deliberated for more than four days , and was confusing enough for Judge Reggie B. Walton to respond Wednesday morning that he did not fully understand the question .
2007_03_01_1829757	2	When he asked for clarification , the jurors sent back a second message : Never mind . ''
2007_03_01_1829757	3	We are clear on what we need to do , '' the second message read . ''

2007_03_01_1829770	0	Commuters on average spend 6 percent of their day getting back and forth to work , but their time spent in buses , trains and cars accounts for more than half their daily exposure to harmful diesel fumes that can shorten lives and cause disease , according to a new study by the environmental group Clean Air Task Force .

2007_03_01_1829776	0	You know what I 'm really into these days ?
2007_03_01_1829776	1	Speech recognition in Windows Vista .
2007_03_01_1829776	2	As I wrote in my Vista review for The Times , I do n't find it quite as accurate as my beloved Dragon NaturallySpeaking 9 , which is freakishly , `` Star Trek '' - ishly accurate .
2007_03_01_1829776	3	But it 's awfully cool .
2007_03_01_1829776	4	Hook up a microphone headset and give it a shot .
2007_03_01_1829776	5	Speech Recognition lets you not only control your PC by voice -- open programs , click buttons , click Web links , and so on -- but also dictate text , a heck of a lot faster than you can type .
2007_03_01_1829776	6	The first time you open Speech Recognition , you arrive at a very slick , very impressive full-screen tutorial/introduction , featuring a 20-something model in a white gauzy room that appears to be heaven .
2007_03_01_1829776	7	Click your way through the screens .
2007_03_01_1829776	8	Along the way , you 're shown the basics : how to dictate and how to operate buttons , menus , windows , programs , and so on .
2007_03_01_1829776	9	( At the outset , Windows is just simulating its responses to what you say .
2007_03_01_1829776	10	But behind the scenes , it 's actually studying your real utterances , learning about your voice , and shaping your voice profile .
2007_03_01_1829776	11	This , in other words , is the `` voice training '' session you ordinarily have to perform with commercial dictation programs . )
2007_03_01_1829776	12	After that 's done , you can start using commands like these : * `` Start listening '' / `` Stop listening . ''
2007_03_01_1829776	13	These commands tell your PC to start and stop listening to you .
2007_03_01_1829776	14	That 's important , because you do n't want it to interpret everything you say .
2007_03_01_1829776	15	It would not be so great if it tried to act when you said to your roommate , `` Hey , Chris , close the window . ''
2007_03_01_1829776	16	Once you 've opened the Speech Recognition program , you can hit a keystroke to turn listening on and off instead .
2007_03_01_1829776	17	That key combo is Ctlr + Windows key .
2007_03_01_1829776	18	`` Control Windows '' ? )
2007_03_01_1829776	19	Now you can start opening programs by voice .
2007_03_01_1829776	20	For example , you can say : * `` Start Calculator . ''
2007_03_01_1829776	21	Opens the program you named , without you having to touch the mouse .
2007_03_01_1829776	22	* `` Switch to Word . ''
2007_03_01_1829776	23	Switches to the program you named .
2007_03_01_1829776	24	You operate menus by saying whatever you would have clicked with the mouse .
2007_03_01_1829776	25	For example , say `` Edit '' to open the Edit menu , then `` Select All '' to choose that command , and so on .
2007_03_01_1829776	26	* `` Print . ''
2007_03_01_1829776	27	You can also click any button by saying its name -- or any tab name in a dialog box .
2007_03_01_1829776	28	You can also click any link on a Web page just by saying its name .
2007_03_01_1829776	29	And you can tell Windows to `` double-click '' or `` right-click '' anything you see .
2007_03_01_1829776	30	* `` Close that '' closes the frontmost window .
2007_03_01_1829776	31	Also `` Minimize that , '' `` Maximize that , '' `` Restore that . ''
2007_03_01_1829776	32	* `` Scroll up . ''
2007_03_01_1829776	33	You can say `` up , '' `` down , '' `` left , '' or `` right , '' and you can also append any number from one to 20 to indicate how many lines : `` Scroll down 10 . ''
2007_03_01_1829776	34	* `` Press Shift-F three times . ''
2007_03_01_1829776	35	Makes Windows press the key you named , the number of times you named .
2007_03_01_1829776	36	( You do n't have to say `` Press '' before certain critical keys : Delete , Home , End , Space , Tab , Enter , Backspace .
2007_03_01_1829776	37	Just say the key 's name : `` Tab . '' )
2007_03_01_1829776	38	* `` Show numbers . ''
2007_03_01_1829776	39	It 's great to know that you can click any button or tab by saying its name .
2007_03_01_1829776	40	But what if you do n't know its name ?
2007_03_01_1829776	41	What if it 's some cryptic little icon on a toolbar ?
2007_03_01_1829776	42	You ca n't exactly say , `` Click the little thing that looks like a guy putting his head between two rollers . ''
2007_03_01_1829776	43	For this purpose , Microsoft has created a clever command called `` Show numbers . ''
2007_03_01_1829776	44	When you say that , the program overlays every clickable thing with superimposed colorful numbers .
2007_03_01_1829776	45	Just say the number of the button you want , and then say `` OK . ''
2007_03_01_1829776	46	The numbers appear automatically if there 's more than one button of the same name on the screen , too -- several Settings buttons in a dialog box , for example .
2007_03_01_1829776	47	This trick also works great on Web pages .
2007_03_01_1829776	48	Say `` Show numbers '' to see a number label superimposed on every clickable element of the page .
2007_03_01_1829776	49	The real Holy Grail for speech recognition , of course , is dictation -- you speak , and Windows transcribes your words , typing them into any document .
2007_03_01_1829776	50	( This feature is especially important on Tablet PCs that do n't have keyboards . )
2007_03_01_1829776	51	It 's also very easy .
2007_03_01_1829776	52	You just talk -- at regular speed , into any program where you can type .
2007_03_01_1829776	53	The only real difference is that you have to say the punctuation .
2007_03_01_1829776	54	You know : `` Dear Mom ( comma , new line ) : How are things going ( question mark ) ?
2007_03_01_1829776	55	Ca n't believe I 'll be home for Thanksgiving in only 24 more weeks ( exclamation mark ) ! ''
2007_03_01_1829776	56	Mastering dictation also involves learning how to make corrections , which you can do entirely by voice .
2007_03_01_1829776	57	For example , suppose that you said , `` I enjoyed the ceremony , '' and Speech Recognition typed out , `` I enjoyed this era money . ''
2007_03_01_1829776	58	You 'd just say , `` Correct this era money . ''
2007_03_01_1829776	59	Instantly , the Alternates panel pops up ; if the correct transcription is among the choices in the list , say its number and then OK .
2007_03_01_1829776	60	Or , if the correct transcription does n't appear in the list , speak the correct text again ( `` the ceremony '' ) .
2007_03_01_1829776	61	Almost always , the version you wanted now appears in the list .
2007_03_01_1829776	62	Say its number and then OK .
2007_03_01_1829776	63	If the correct transcription still does n't appear in the list , you can say , `` Spell it . ''
2007_03_01_1829776	64	When you finally exit the Alternates panel , Speech Recognition replaces the corrected text and learns from its mistake .
2007_03_01_1829776	65	There are a lot more clever commands that are worth exploring ; say `` What can I say ? ''
2007_03_01_1829776	66	to see the master cheat sheet .
2007_03_01_1829776	67	Do n't miss , for example , the `` mousegrid '' command , which lets you control the movement of the cursor itself with creepy accuracy .

2007_03_01_1829777	0	Deutsche Telekom AG said on Thursday it was seeking acquisitions to fuel growth as Europe 's largest telecoms operator blamed fierce competition and staff costs for a 43 percent drop in annual net profit .
2007_03_01_1829777	1	Hoisting an effective `` for sale '' sign over non-core assets such as Internet companies in France , Spain and radio towers in Germany and the United States , the group 's new chief executive vowed to cut costs and revive the flagship German company .
2007_03_01_1829777	2	`` Our focus for growth will be abroad , '' said Rene Obermann , who faces analysts and investors later on Thursday for the first time as CEO since taking the helm in November .
2007_03_01_1829777	3	`` We want to examine mobile phone acquisitions abroad . ''
2007_03_01_1829777	4	Deutsche Telekom has been tipped as a possible acquirer of a stake in Greek peer OTE , which owns growing eastern-European assets , and of France Telecom 's ( NYSE : FTE ) Orange Netherlands unit .
2007_03_01_1829777	5	But Obermann declined to be drawn on details .
2007_03_01_1829777	6	Deutsche Telekom 's shares , which have been on a downward trend since January , slid 2.5 percent , underperforming a flat , broader telecoms market .
2007_03_01_1829777	7	Despite shocking the market in late January with its second profit warning in six months , net profit of 3.17 billion euros ( $ 4.2 billion ) missed average analyst forecasts of 4.24 billion euros .
2007_03_01_1829777	8	Revenues came in at 61.3 billion euros , as expected .
2007_03_01_1829777	9	But the company also disappointed some investors by leaving its dividend unchanged at 0.72 euros per share .
2007_03_01_1829777	10	`` There were some hopes for a positive surprise regarding the dividend , but they were not fulfilled , '' HVB analyst Thomas Friedrich said .
2007_03_01_1829777	11	Europe 's largest phone operator by sales wants to save 2.0 billion euros this year and 4.2-4 .7 billion euros by 2010 from 2005 levels .
2007_03_01_1829777	12	As part of the drive , Deutsche Telekom plans to move up to 50,000 employees into lower-paying subsidiaries .
2007_03_01_1829777	13	Thousands of staff have taken to the streets in protest .
2007_03_01_1829777	14	It also wants to beef up domestic customers , who have been leaving in droves for smaller , cheaper rivals , by more than 40 percent this year .
2007_03_01_1829777	15	Deutsche Telekom plans to follow some of its domestic peers and launch a no-frills brand in Germany , Europe 's largest telecoms market , to claw back lower-spending customers .
2007_03_01_1829777	16	Obermann said the new brand should generate 1.0 billion euros by 2010 .
2007_03_01_1829777	17	Some analysts warned that there was still no evidence that the fall in prices in the German market had slowed or that Deutsche Telekom 's new management team could negotiate the prickly politics of trying to cut the company 's swollen cost base .
2007_03_01_1829777	18	Of the 250,000 staff Deutsche Telekom employs worldwide , 180,000 are based in Germany and 45,000 are effectively civil servants .
2007_03_01_1829777	19	However , some investors are willing to bide their time while Obermann , who at 43 is the youngest chief executive in Germany 's blue-chip DAX index , finds his feet at a company that has already ousted two of his predecessors .
2007_03_01_1829777	20	`` We are waiting for an investor day , '' said Heinrich Ey , a fund manager at Deutscher Investment Trust DIT .
2007_03_01_1829777	21	`` They will probably try to sell some non-core assets abroad , like the broadband business in Spain and France .
2007_03_01_1829777	22	That should be possible .
2007_03_01_1829777	23	We see that slightly positive .
2007_03_01_1829777	24	But it would not be enough for any real advancement . ''
2007_03_01_1829777	25	The former state monopoly is struggling to stem a loss of customers in its fixed-line business in Germany , which is under attack from a slew of resellers offering discounted broadband packages .
2007_05_01_1844161	0	LAST fall , after experiencing a dull ache in his hip for months , Frank Berger felt the pain escalating so much that he could n't sleep .
2007_05_01_1844161	1	Walking became so difficult that Mr. Berger , a 59-year-old accountant in Nantucket , Mass. , had to ask his secretary to bring him documents from the printer only 40 feet away .
2007_05_01_1844161	2	Mr. Berger 's orthopedic surgeon , Dr. Rocco Monto , took an X-ray , which showed nothing unusual , and an M.R.I. scan , which revealed a lesion in the soft tissue above the left hip joint .
2007_05_01_1844161	3	But the M.R.I. did n't show enough detail to determine whether the problem was separation of cartilage from bone or avascular necrosis , which causes loss of blood flow to the affected area .
2007_05_01_1844161	4	Dr. Monto suggested another step : inserting a camera-mounted probe into the hip for a closer look .
2007_05_01_1844161	5	He told Mr. Berger that the arthroscopy might end up being diagnostic ; if he found avascular necrosis or something else he could not repair , he would refer him for open surgery for a vascular graft or a hip replacement .
2007_05_01_1844161	6	But if it was something that could be fixed immediately , he could perform surgery with the arthroscope .
2007_05_01_1844161	7	Mr. Berger , who dreaded having his hip replaced , underwent a hip arthroscopy in January .
2007_05_01_1844161	8	Dr. Monto examined the spot and removed a lesion .
2007_05_01_1844161	9	In weeks , Mr. Berger was walking easily .
2007_05_01_1844161	10	Although surgeons in Europe began doing arthroscopy on hip patients decades ago , it has become a popular diagnostic tool in the United States only in the last few years .
2007_05_01_1844161	11	Many surgeons say that the technique is helping to identify bone and cartilage defects in the hip that do not show up in scans or appear too fuzzy to guide treatments .
2007_05_01_1844161	12	As a result , patients who until five years ago would have had hip replacements or hip resurfacing are now being treated with less drastic surgeries like removing tissue flap .
2007_05_01_1844161	13	Dr. Monto described the procedure as a sweet spot '' where diagnosis meets therapy . ''
2007_05_01_1844161	14	But other surgeons and radiologists say that hip arthroscopy should be used for treating problems that have been diagnosed with conventional screening .
2007_05_01_1844161	15	Exploratory arthroscopy can be an unnecessary risk , they say , given that the space in the hip joint has little room for the instruments . ''
2007_05_01_1844161	16	There are surgeons out there who will do hip arthroscopies at the drop of a hat to make money , '' said Dr. Joseph Lane , a professor of orthopedic surgery at Weill Medical College of Cornell University in New York and the medical director of the Osteoporosis Center at the Hospital for Special Surgery , which is affiliated with Weill Cornell .
2007_05_01_1844161	17	Before doing a hip arthroscopy , Dr. Lane said , surgeons should know what they will be treating .
2007_05_01_1844161	18	There is no reason , he said , that '' a good M.R.I. scan in the hands of a good surgeon '' combined with an X-ray should n't be enough to make a diagnosis .
2007_05_01_1844161	19	After that , '' the surgeon should be able to decide whether the condition can be treated by arthroscopy or open surgery , '' Dr. Lane said .
2007_05_01_1844161	20	Radiologists say that improvements in hip M.R.I. 's are a good reason to avoid diagnostic arthroscopy .
2007_05_01_1844161	21	Newer scanners use magnets that are more powerful than those in older machines , providing sharper images .
2007_05_01_1844161	22	During the M.R.I , many medical centers put a magnetic coil over the patient 's hip for more detail . ''
2007_05_01_1844161	23	We 've come a long way from traditional M.R.I. scans of the hip , which could only show if something huge was going on , '' said Dr. Hollis G. Potter , a radiologist at the Hospital for Special Surgery .
2007_05_01_1844161	24	Dr. Potter said that many imaging facilities still use conventional M.R.I. protocols for hip scans , which are n't helpful to surgeons .
2007_05_01_1844161	25	That is why , Dr. Lane said , getting a high-quality M.R.I. is essential . ''
2007_05_01_1844161	26	The patient needs to ask the doctor : ` How good will my M.R.I. be ? ' ''
2007_05_01_1844161	27	Dr. Monto , a fellow of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons , dismissed claims that newer M.R.I. 's were good enough to eliminate diagnostic arthroscopy .
2007_05_01_1844161	28	He said he had seen many patients who had had '' high-res , enhanced M.R.I. scans '' that showed little concern , yet pathologies appeared under an arthroscope . ''
2007_05_01_1844161	29	I am always amazed by what I find when I 'm in there that has been missed by an M.R.I. , '' he said .
2007_05_01_1844162	0	LATE last fall , Carrie R. , a public relations executive who lives in Riverdale in the Bronx , noticed that her 2-year-old daughter had been suffering from a nagging cough for far too long .
2007_05_01_1844162	1	She assumed the toddler had caught a cold or was reacting to the change in weather .
2007_05_01_1844162	2	But when the cough hung on for several more weeks , and became so severe that her daughter vomited , Carrie began to worry about something more serious .
2007_05_01_1844162	3	Still , she was stunned by her pediatrician 's diagnosis -- asthma . ''
2007_05_01_1844162	4	I was completely blindsided , '' said Carrie , who asked that her surname not be used to protect the privacy of her daughter . ''
2007_05_01_1844162	5	I thought asthma would look more like an ` attack , ' not just coughing .
2007_05_01_1844162	6	My pediatrician is wonderful , but I ended up taking my daughter to a specialist because this diagnosis was very serious and seemed so out of the blue that I wanted to be sure . ''
2007_05_01_1844162	7	Though asthma is a common disorder , particularly in childhood , it can be difficult to diagnose .
2007_05_01_1844162	8	Doctors can struggle to figure out whether a child who is having trouble breathing has asthma rather than a virus , nasal allergy or other upper-respiratory problem .
2007_05_01_1844162	9	Unlike the tests for some diseases , checking for asthma does not involve using high-technology equipment or techniques .
2007_05_01_1844162	10	While there are tests -- the most common uses a device called a spirometer , which measures airway efficiency -- doctors often rely more on family histories and thorough questioning about symptoms and exposure to allergens .
2007_05_01_1844162	11	There is no definitive test , said Dr. Stuart Stoloff , a family practice physician in Carson City , Nev. '' There are no easy markers or a single blood test to tell when it 's asthma and when it 's not .
2007_05_01_1844162	12	Instead you have to carefully look at the whole picture . ''
2007_05_01_1844162	13	Dr. Stoloff is on an expert panel that is rewriting the federal guidelines for diagnosing and managing asthma .
2007_05_01_1844162	14	By early summer , the National Heart , Lung and Blood Institute and the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program will introduce these new recommendations , which place added emphasis on analyzing symptoms , looking for allergens , gathering histories and confirming the diagnosis with spirometry .
2007_05_01_1844162	15	Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease that affects 20 million Americans , including 9 million children , or 6.5 percent of the under-18 population .
2007_05_01_1844162	16	It is characterized by attacks of inflammation and narrowing of the small airways of the lungs , generally sparked by a viral infection ( like those that cause colds ) , exercise or exposure to pet hair , pollen or other allergens .
2007_05_01_1844162	17	But because attacks can vary in intensity and show up as shortness of breath , wheezing , coughing , chest pain , rapid breathing or a combination of these symptoms , asthma can often be confused with other illnesses .
2007_05_01_1844162	18	The growing incidence of obesity in children has made diagnosing asthma even trickier . ''
2007_05_01_1844162	19	Investigators are reporting that more and more children , particularly adolescents , are coming in with a diagnosis of asthma and they are also obese , '' said Dr. Alkis G. Togias , the section chief , asthma and inflammation , division of allergy , immunology and transplantation at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda , Md. '' But it is not clear that they have asthma .
2007_05_01_1844162	20	It might be that the obesity is causing shortness of breath . ''
2007_05_01_1844162	21	Experts worry that asthma is often not diagnosed , particularly in young children . ''
2007_05_01_1844162	22	Younger children , under 7 or 8 , sometimes ca n't express themselves well , '' said Dr. Norman H. Edelman , the chief medical officer for the American Lung Association and professor of preventive medicine at Stony Brook University Medical Center , in Stony Brook , N.Y. .
2007_05_01_1844162	23	A spirometer test can help confirm an asthma diagnosis .
2007_05_01_1844162	24	This device measures the amount of air blown out of the lungs over time .
2007_05_01_1844162	25	But if the test is done when the patient is not having symptoms , it may not show any abnormality .
2007_05_01_1844162	26	Furthermore , not every doctor 's office has such equipment , and some patients whose airway function seems normal might still have asthma .
2007_05_01_1844162	27	In addition , children under 4 generally can not perform the test .
2007_05_01_1844162	28	Dr. Sandra Braganza , an assistant professor of pediatrics at the Children 's Hospital at Montefiore in the Bronx , estimated that about a fourth of all the patients she sees suffer from the disease . ''
2007_05_01_1844162	29	The rates of asthma in our community are so high that when a child comes in with wheezing , coughing or shortness , we immediately suspect asthma , '' she said . ''
2007_05_01_1844162	30	Parents , too , need to know how to recognize the signs and symptoms of asthma , '' she added . ''
2007_05_01_1844162	31	There 's nothing worse than seeing a child who ca n't breathe .
2007_05_01_1844162	32	But being empowered with education makes it a lot less scary . ''
2007_05_01_1844163	0	GLAUCOMA , a chronic condition characterized by damage to the optic nerve , is the second-leading cause of blindness in the United States , but routine screening for it is controversial .
2007_05_01_1844163	1	Glaucoma is caused by various eye diseases and , sometimes , by genetic defects .
2007_05_01_1844163	2	Early on , it has no symptoms .
2007_05_01_1844163	3	There is no cure , but it can be diagnosed by an eye exam , and early treatment can stop its progression .
2007_05_01_1844163	4	Glaucoma affects about 2.5 million people in the United States , and 130,000 of them will become legally blind .
2007_05_01_1844163	5	Half the people who have the disorder do not know it .
2007_05_01_1844163	6	So screening everyone for primary open-angle glaucoma , the most common type , is a good idea , right ?
2007_05_01_1844163	7	The United States Preventive Services Task Force , a federally sponsored panel of experts in primary care and prevention , reports that there are no studies establishing the effectiveness of screening and that the uncertainty of the benefit and the known risks of early treatment make it impossible to determine whether there is any advantage in screening the general population .
2007_05_01_1844163	8	But in January , Dr. H. Dunbar Hoskins Jr. , the executive vice president of the American Academy of Ophthalmology , urged them to reconsider .
2007_05_01_1844163	9	He wrote a letter to the task force arguing that the evidence suggests that testing older people for glaucoma would result in major health and quality-of-life benefits .
2007_05_01_1844163	10	He added that waiting for patients to present themselves increases the incidence of vision loss that might have been prevented by periodic screening and that treatment of glaucoma in its early stages is highly cost effective .
2007_05_01_1844163	11	The problem begins with the difficulty of diagnosing glaucoma .
2007_05_01_1844163	12	It was once thought that increased pressure in the eye , caused by poor drainage of circulating fluid , was a sure sign of glaucoma .
2007_05_01_1844163	13	But it is now known that many people with glaucoma do not have increased pressure and that many who do will never develop glaucoma .
2007_05_01_1844163	14	These problems are what led the Preventive Services Task Force to refrain from recommending screening , said Dr. Ned Calonge , its chairman .
2007_05_01_1844163	15	Still , for certain groups of people , screening may be useful . ''
2007_05_01_1844163	16	People who have a family history and people of African-American descent have an increased risk , '' Dr. Calonge said .
2007_05_01_1844163	17	Glaucoma is the leading cause of blindness in African-Americans , and about five times as common as among whites .
2007_05_01_1844163	18	Ultimately , Dr. Calonge said , it 's an individual decision . ''
2007_05_01_1844163	19	People should discuss these things with those who know them best , with their eye doctor or their primary care physician , '' he said . ''
2007_05_01_1844163	20	If you do that , you have a much better sense of what should and should n't be done . ''
2007_05_01_1844164	0	EVEN though screening tests can prevent colorectal cancer or find it early enough to cure , the disease is still the second-leading cause of cancer death in the United States , with nearly 165,000 new cases and more than 52,000 deaths expected this year .
2007_05_01_1844164	1	Rates of colorectal cancer have been declining in recent years , by about 2 percent annually , thanks mostly to increased screening .
2007_05_01_1844164	2	Yet fewer than half the people who should be screened bother to do so .
2007_05_01_1844164	3	If they did , the death rate could probably be halved , cancer experts say .
2007_05_01_1844164	4	The reason this cancer is so easily prevented or cured is that most of the time it begins as a polyp in the lining of the intestine , progressing slowly and possibly turning malignant .
2007_05_01_1844164	5	Tests that examine the colon can find polyps , and doctors can snip them out before they become cancers .
2007_05_01_1844164	6	Or the tests can reveal early tumors that can also be removed .
2007_05_01_1844164	7	But tests for colorectal cancer are not popular .
2007_05_01_1844164	8	Most adults should start being screened at age 50 ( sooner for people at high risk because of family history , certain bowel disorders or gene mutations ) , but many put it off .
2007_05_01_1844164	9	Some are squeamish about the tests , which require patients to collect stool samples or have an instrument inserted into the rectum .
2007_05_01_1844164	10	Screening advocates point out that the unpleasantness is a small price to pay to avoid a painful and deadly disease , and most people who have had the tests say they are no big deal .
2007_05_01_1844164	11	The worst part of a colonoscopy , many people find , is not the test itself , which is usually done under sedation , but the '' prep , '' which requires a day at home to take supercharged laxatives to empty the intestines . ''
2007_05_01_1844164	12	Data tells us this is a problem of people not feeling a strong impetus to be screened from their primary care physician , '' said Dr. Robert Smith , the director of screening for the American Cancer Society . ''
2007_05_01_1844164	13	Doctors think patients wo n't want to do it , so they do n't bring it up .
2007_05_01_1844164	14	And they may be ambivalent about which test to endorse .
2007_05_01_1844164	15	Some patients get a referral , leave the office and the process of scheduling is so esoteric it just does n't happen .
2007_05_01_1844164	16	Everybody 's intending to do the right thing , but it does n't get around to taking place . ''
2007_05_01_1844164	17	For people with an average risk of developing colorectal cancer , the American Cancer Society recommends that screening start at 50 , with one of five tests : An annual fecal occult blood test , or a new version called a fecal immunochemical test , to look for blood in the stool .
2007_05_01_1844164	18	Every five years , flexible sigmoidoscopy , in which a scope examines the lower part of the colon .
2007_05_01_1844164	19	An annual stool test with sigmoidoscopy every five years .
2007_05_01_1844164	20	A test involving a barium enema and X-rays every five years .
2007_05_01_1844164	21	Every 10 years , colonoscopy , in which a scope is inserted into the rectum to examine the entire large intestine .
2007_05_01_1844164	22	If one of the first four tests finds anything abnormal , colonoscopy is needed to check further .
2007_05_01_1844164	23	The first test developed for blood in the stool required that patients avoid eating red meat or raw vegetables for several days beforehand , to avoid false positives , but that is not required for the newer immunochemical test .
2007_05_01_1844164	24	This test is also easier to perform and may replace the old one , but it costs more and not all insurers cover it yet , Dr. Smith said .
2007_05_01_1844164	25	Patients must do the stool tests themselves at home on several samples , the cancer society emphasizes .
2007_05_01_1844164	26	Polyps are less likely to bleed than actual cancers , so the tests for blood are more likely to find cancers than they are to detect polyps .
2007_05_01_1844164	27	The drawback of sigmoidoscopy is that it examines only the lower part of the colon , so it misses polyps or cancers higher up .
2007_05_01_1844164	28	Barium-enema tests do not find as many small polyps as colonoscopy does , Dr. Smith said .
2007_05_01_1844164	29	But colonoscopy can also miss polyps , especially if doctors rush it , studies have found .
2007_05_01_1844164	30	Yet it is still the best test , Dr. Smith said , because when done carefully it finds small polyps , which can be removed right then .
2007_05_01_1844164	31	For most people , the test does not have to be done more than once every 10 years . ''
2007_05_01_1844164	32	But is it available or can you pay ? ''
2007_05_01_1844164	33	Dr. Smith said . ''
2007_05_01_1844164	34	Can you get the examination in a timely fashion ?
2007_05_01_1844164	35	You may have an eight - or nine-month wait to get one . ''
2007_05_01_1844164	36	Some doctors do tests for blood in the stool when patients are in the 10-year interval between colonoscopies , but Dr. Smith said that is '' excessive and not justified . '' ''
2007_05_01_1844164	37	Virtual colonoscopy '' sounds less onerous to some people .
2007_05_01_1844164	38	It involves using a CT scan instead of a scope , and does n't require sedation .
2007_05_01_1844164	39	It does require the same prep as colonoscopy , with a tube inserted into the rectum to inflate the colon with gas to create clearer images .
2007_05_01_1844164	40	Polyps can not be removed during this procedure , so if any show up , the patient has to go back for a colonoscopy .
2007_05_01_1844164	41	The virtual test is being heavily marketed by some clinics , but the American Cancer Society and other groups are not recommending it yet , saying it needs more study .
2007_05_01_1844164	42	But Dr. Smith said , '' I think the data from expert centers is really quite promising . ''
2007_05_01_1844165	0	WHILE the annual number of new H.I.V. infections is sharply lower than in the peak years of the 1980s , the effort to reduce the infection rate further has stalled in the last decade .
2007_05_01_1844165	1	So the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now recommends screening for H.I.V. as a routine part of health care , and not just for people in known risk groups .
2007_05_01_1844165	2	With other sexually transmitted diseases , or S.T.D. 's , the usefulness and cost effectiveness of testing depend on the population being screened .
2007_05_01_1844165	3	Although general screening for all S.T.D. 's is not recommended , pregnant women , adolescents and gay men require special attention , and there are times when even people who fall into none of these groups should also be tested .
2007_05_01_1844165	4	There is no controversy about the new H.I.V. recommendations .
2007_05_01_1844165	5	According to the C.D.C. , 250,000 of the 1 million Americans with H.I.V. do not know they are infected . ''
2007_05_01_1844165	6	There 's very good evidence that as soon as you know your status , you modify your behavior , '' said Dr. Carlos Del Rio , a professor of medicine at Emory University and head of the Emory AIDS International Training and Research Program . ''
2007_05_01_1844165	7	So getting people to know they 're infected and getting them into care is the huge challenge . ''
2007_05_01_1844165	8	All pregnant women in the United States should be tested for H.I.V. infection as early as possible .
2007_05_01_1844165	9	Dr. Del Rio says that such screenings have greatly reduced the number of babies born infected .
2007_05_01_1844165	10	Pregnant women should also be screened for hepatitis B and chlamydia , and for gonorrhea if they live in an area where its prevalence is high .
2007_05_01_1844165	11	Teenagers are biologically more susceptible to infection , they often have unprotected sex and are more likely to engage in sex with multiple partners for short periods of time .
2007_05_01_1844165	12	Chlamydia and gonorrhea are most prevalent among girls 15 to 19 , and herpes , or H.P.V. , the most common sexually transmitted disease in the United States , is often contracted during adolescence .
2007_05_01_1844165	13	Still , screening all adolescents for S.T.D. 's is neither practical nor desirable , and the C.D.C. recommends relying on sex education and the guidance of health professionals to decide who should be tested .
2007_05_01_1844165	14	All states and the District of Columbia allow adolescents to receive medical care for S.T.D. 's without parental consent .
2007_05_01_1844165	15	Gay men are at high risk for H.I.V. and other S.T.D. 's , and higher rates of unsafe sexual behavior have recently led to growing rates of infection with syphilis , gonorrhea and chlamydia in this population .
2007_05_01_1844165	16	The C.D.C. recommends routine screenings of gay men for H.I.V. and syphilis .
2007_05_01_1844165	17	This population should also be screened for urethral and rectal infections with gonorrhea and chlamydia and for throat infections with gonorrhea .
2007_05_01_1844165	18	Correction : May 10 , 2007 , Thursday An article in the special Personal Health section on May 1 , about sexually transmitted diseases , misidentified the viruses that cause herpes , the most common sexually transmitted disease in the United States .
2007_05_01_1844165	19	They are strains of H.S.V. , or herpes simplex virus -- not H.P.V. , or human papillomavirus .
2007_05_01_1844166	0	WHEN George Skouras , an investment manager in New York , turned 52 , he decided to go for a complete physical exam .
2007_05_01_1844166	1	He felt perfectly healthy , but wanted to know if there was anything to worry about .
2007_05_01_1844166	2	So he went to a specialty clinic for tests .
2007_05_01_1844166	3	Among them were heart scans .
2007_05_01_1844166	4	The news was not good .
2007_05_01_1844166	5	Mr. Skouras had a plaque buildup in his coronary arteries , partly obstructing two .
2007_05_01_1844166	6	What , he wondered , should he do ?
2007_05_01_1844166	7	He knew his cholesterol level was a bit high .
2007_05_01_1844166	8	But he hesitated to take statins , drugs that can lower cholesterol levels , concerned that side effects might emerge over decades .
2007_05_01_1844166	9	And though he worries that statins are not completely safe , most cardiologists cite large , long-term studies finding that the drugs are rarely risky and that benefits , for the populations studied , are indisputable .
2007_05_01_1844166	10	His quandary , heart specialists said , reflects the difficult questions that a new era in heart disease assessment has produced : do new tests , like heart scans , work to people 's benefit ?
2007_05_01_1844166	11	How much testing for heart disease makes a difference , and what tests should people have ?
2007_05_01_1844166	12	What should you do if you have a test and it shows something you did not expect ?
2007_05_01_1844166	13	The answers , as often happens in medicine , depend on whom you ask .
2007_05_01_1844166	14	Mr. Skouras consulted several experts , including Dr. Peter Libby , the chief of cardiovascular medicine at the Brigham and Women 's Hospital in Boston .
2007_05_01_1844166	15	Dr. Libby says he is hearing from more patients like Mr. Skouras .
2007_05_01_1844166	16	They undergo tests for heart disease , but once they have the results , they are not sure what to do .
2007_05_01_1844166	17	Nearly everyone agrees on the basics .
2007_05_01_1844166	18	Adults should know their cholesterol , blood-sugar and blood-pressure levels and should keep them within national guidelines .
2007_05_01_1844166	19	It is often reasonable to try dieting and exercising , but if that fails , most people should take prescription drugs .
2007_05_01_1844166	20	If everyone took those steps , that alone could make the heart attack rate plummet , says Dr. Daniel Levy , the director of the Framingham Heart Study , a federal study of the population of Framingham , Mass. .
2007_05_01_1844166	21	Dr. Levy said the study indicated that nearly every heart attack from age 50 to age 95 could have been prevented if people had their blood pressure , blood sugar and cholesterol under control at age 50 and did not smoke .
2007_05_01_1844166	22	Yet , he noted , only 5 percent of the nation 's 50-year-olds do this .
2007_05_01_1844166	23	But the testing question gets murky after that .
2007_05_01_1844166	24	Some , like the United States Preventive Services Task Force , a federally sponsored panel of experts in primary care and prevention , says that most people should take only basic tests . ''
2007_05_01_1844166	25	The message we are trying to get across is that more testing is not always beneficial , '' said the panel 's chairman , Dr. Ned Calonge .
2007_05_01_1844166	26	The concern is that seemingly innocuous tests will give false-positive results , which lead to more tests and even treatments , when there was nothing wrong to begin with .
2007_05_01_1844166	27	When it comes to people like Mr. Skouras , who know they are at increased risk of heart disease -- remember , his cholesterol level was too high -- Dr. Calonge wonders what more tests can possibly reveal .
2007_05_01_1844166	28	The only thing Mr. Skouras can do to protect himself against a heart attack is to lower his cholesterol level , advice he already has .
2007_05_01_1844166	29	Dr. Daniel Rader , who directs the lipid program at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine , said he might be faced , for example , with deciding how to advise a 40-year-old man with a family history of premature heart disease , and whose LDL cholesterol is 125 , at the high end of normal .
2007_05_01_1844166	30	Should this man take a statin to lower his cholesterol further ? ''
2007_05_01_1844166	31	No one knows , '' Dr. Rader said .
2007_05_01_1844166	32	The guidelines say he does not need the drug .
2007_05_01_1844166	33	Yet , Dr. Rader says , his family history is worrisome .
2007_05_01_1844166	34	Many people like him will have a heart attack .
2007_05_01_1844166	35	Dr. Rader , like other heart specialists , said he often turned to more tests to assess how great the person 's risk really is .
2007_05_01_1844166	36	For example , he may test for blood proteins whose presence in elevated levels can indicate increased heart attack risk .
2007_05_01_1844166	37	Dr. Rader said he also he might suggest heart scans , like those Mr. Skouras had .
2007_05_01_1844166	38	Mr. Skouras decided to see how far he could go with diet and exercise instead of taking statins .
2007_05_01_1844166	39	He was not fat , but he lost 16 pounds , reducing his LDL cholesterol level by 30 percent , to 140 .
2007_05_01_1844166	40	That , though , is not as low as Dr. Libby would like .
2007_05_01_1844166	41	So Mr. Skouras remains troubled .
2007_05_01_1844166	42	As he sees it , it 's all a matter of probabilities -- the chance that a statin will prevent a heart attack for him personally , which no one can tell him for sure , versus the chance that a statin will turn out , after decades of use , to have been worse than nothing for him personally .
2007_05_01_1844166	43	And that , of course , is also unknown . ''
2007_05_01_1844166	44	The frustrating thing , '' Mr. Skouras said , '' is no one can really tell you cause and effect -- that if you do this , this is what you will get . ''
2007_05_01_1844167	0	AT age 39 , with diabetes and high blood pressure in her family , Linda M. was starting to worry about her weight and its health consequences .
2007_05_01_1844167	1	She was 5 feet 6 inches tall and weighed 170 pounds , which placed her in the overweight category , according to the standard definition .
2007_05_01_1844167	2	Although she was not officially obese , she said , '' I realized I was not at my ideal weight . ''
2007_05_01_1844167	3	But Linda was in for a surprise during an appointment last fall with Dr. Judith Korner , an obesity specialist at Columbia University .
2007_05_01_1844167	4	Instead of weighing her , Dr. Korner whipped out a tape measure and measured her waist .
2007_05_01_1844167	5	It was 35 inches , putting her in a danger zone , Dr. Korner explained .
2007_05_01_1844167	6	An overweight woman with a waist 35 inches or larger , or an overweight man with at least a 40-inch waist , is at increased risk for diabetes and heart disease . ''
2007_05_01_1844167	7	That was an education , '' said Linda M. , who did not want her last name revealed because of her weight . ''
2007_05_01_1844167	8	I did not realize that my waist determined my future risk . ''
2007_05_01_1844167	9	Obesity specialists differ on what measurements are best .
2007_05_01_1844167	10	Linda 's body mass index , or B.M.I. , for example , was 27.4 , far from the obesity category , which starts at 30 .
2007_05_01_1844167	11	She would have to weigh 185 pounds to have a B.M.I. that high .
2007_05_01_1844167	12	( For comparison , a man who is six feet tall and weighs 221 pounds is considered obese . )
2007_05_01_1844167	13	If a doctor were to use B.M.I. exclusively to evaluate Linda , the conclusion would be that her weight was not a serious health risk .
2007_05_01_1844167	14	She had only one risk factor for heart disease -- a high level of triglycerides -- and the guidelines for B.M.I. say that overweight people need two factors , like high triglycerides and a high cholesterol or blood pressure levels , to be considered at serious risk .
2007_05_01_1844167	15	Muscular men might have high B.M.I. 's , which make them seem fatter than they are .
2007_05_01_1844167	16	Old people often have deceptively low B.M.I. 's because they have lost so much muscle in the aging process .
2007_05_01_1844167	17	In Linda M. 's case , adding her waist measurement to her B.M.I. indicates a high health risk , according to guidelines published by the National Heart , Lung and Blood Institute .
2007_05_01_1844167	18	For Dr. Korner , the test is useful in assessing if people like Linda M. -- overweight but in a gray zone -- face a true health risk ?
2007_05_01_1844167	19	If her waist had been less than 35 inches , Dr. Korner would have been less concerned .
2007_05_01_1844167	20	Dr. Ned Calonge , chairman of the United States Preventive Services Task Force , said the panel preferred B.M.I. measurements to determine whether people are fat enough to place their health at risk .
2007_05_01_1844167	21	For most adults , he explained , B.M.I. '' is more feasible or has better validity than other measures . ''
2007_05_01_1844167	22	But , Dr. Calonge added , it is not enough to simply diagnose someone as obese .
2007_05_01_1844167	23	The goal should be better health .
2007_05_01_1844167	24	And the problem with testing for obesity , using B.M.I. or anything else , is that the sort of counseling most patients get from their doctors has not been shown to improve health , Dr. Calonge said . ''
2007_05_01_1844167	25	You now have a , quote , diagnosis , '' Dr. Calonge said .
2007_05_01_1844167	26	And there is at least fair evidence from research that intense and expensive counseling about diet and exercise can help people lose weight and improve conditions that place them at risk for heart disease .
2007_05_01_1844167	27	But , he added , '' it is uncertain whether less intense interventions have any impact at all . ''
2007_05_01_1844167	28	For Madelyn Fernstrom , the director of the Health System Weight Management Center at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center , the goal of a medical exam is not to document how fat someone is but to rule out rare metabolic conditions that might be causing the weight problem .
2007_05_01_1844167	29	An exam also helps to determine whether there are associated medical conditions that should be treated , like diabetes or high cholesterol or blood pressure .
2007_05_01_1844167	30	As for Linda M. , waist measurement made the difference . ''
2007_05_01_1844167	31	After that , I got myself in gear , '' she said . ''
2007_05_01_1844167	32	I tried to eat less sugar and healthier snacks ; I was more conscious of what I was selecting . ''
2007_05_01_1844167	33	She lost 20 pounds and a couple of inches from her waist .
2007_05_01_1844167	34	Her triglycerides are lower , yet still a bit high .
2007_05_01_1844167	35	But , she says , as she sees it , with a smaller waist , '' I 'm out of the danger zone . ''
2007_05_01_1844168	0	MORE than six million Americans are walking around with no idea that they have an insidious disease with the potential to wreak havoc throughout the body .
2007_05_01_1844168	1	The disease is diabetes , and it causes high blood sugar levels that can damage arteries and lead to heart disease , strokes , kidney failure , amputations and blindness .
2007_05_01_1844168	2	It is the sixth-leading cause of death in the United States .
2007_05_01_1844168	3	The idea of so many people -- roughly 30 percent of the 21 million Americans who have the disease -- going without treatment is disturbing because diabetes can do so much damage .
2007_05_01_1844168	4	But in its early stages , people often do not realize they are ill , because the symptoms -- if there are any -- may creep up gradually or be attributed to overwork or aging . ''
2007_05_01_1844168	5	Certain signs are important , '' said Dr. F. Xavier Pi-Sunyer , chief of endocrinology , diabetes and nutrition at St. Luke 's - Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan . ''
2007_05_01_1844168	6	If you have to get up a couple of times to urinate at night , and you did n't before , that 's a suggestive sign .
2007_05_01_1844168	7	Also , vision blurring of any kind , suddenly beginning to lose a significant amount of weight without trying , frequent skin infections or vaginal infections .
2007_05_01_1844168	8	And this is nonspecific , but if you 're getting headaches and feeling kind of fatigued . ''
2007_05_01_1844168	9	Any of those symptoms should prompt testing for diabetes , Dr. Pi-Sunyer said .
2007_05_01_1844168	10	So should certain risk factors , especially if there are more than one .
2007_05_01_1844168	11	Aging and obesity increase the odds that a person will develop Type 2 , or adult-onset diabetes , the most common form .
2007_05_01_1844168	12	Weight is a particular risk factor , especially if it is mostly in the belly -- a waist over 40 inches in men or 35 inches in women .
2007_05_01_1844168	13	Blacks , Native Americans and Hispanics have a higher-than-average risk , as do people with a family history of the disease .
2007_05_01_1844168	14	Being sedentary may also increase the risk , though not all researchers agree about that .
2007_05_01_1844168	15	People who appear healthy but have risk factors should be tested for diabetes every three years , Dr. Pi-Sunyer said .
2007_05_01_1844168	16	The simplest means for earlier detection is a blood sugar test , measured after a person has fasted for at least eight hours .
2007_05_01_1844168	17	Readings above 126 milligrams of glucose per tenth of a liter of blood indicate diabetes ; anything below 100 is considered normal .
2007_05_01_1844168	18	Intermediate levels reflect impaired glucose metabolism or '' pre-diabetes . ''
2007_05_01_1844168	19	People in this category need yearly testing , because up to 8 percent of them will become diabetic each year .
2007_05_01_1844168	20	About 54 million Americans are pre-diabetic .
2007_05_01_1844168	21	Though many doctors in the United States like the fasting blood sugar test because it is quick and easy , some use another test , one that may pick up diabetes at an even earlier stage .
2007_05_01_1844168	22	This is a glucose tolerance test , in which the patient is given a fasting blood sugar test , drinks a glucose solution and then has another blood sugar test two hours later .
2007_05_01_1844168	23	People who test positive for Type 2 diabetes are generally advised to lose weight and exercise more , and some may also need drugs to help lower blood sugar .
2007_05_01_1844168	24	They will also usually be tested for conditions that often go along with Type 2 diabetes , like high blood pressure and high cholesterol and triglyceride levels .
2007_05_01_1844168	25	A major study of people with impaired glucose metabolism found that among those who did moderate exercise , like walking for just 30 minutes a day , and who lost 5 to 10 percent of their body weight , there were 58 percent fewer new cases of diabetes than in a similar group of people who did not exercise or lose weight .
2007_05_01_1844168	26	The study also found that a commonly used diabetes drug , metformin , could help lower the risk of the disease in pre-diabetics .
2007_05_01_1844168	27	But the drug did not work as well as weight loss and exercise , and it is approved only for diabetes , not for pre-diabetes .
2007_05_01_1844168	28	In April a genetic test was introduced that can also identify people with an increased risk of developing Type 2 diabetes .
2007_05_01_1844168	29	The $ 500 test by DeCode Genetics can not predict diabetes definitively , but it might motivate people with a high risk to exercise and lose weight .
2007_05_01_1844168	30	It can be ordered by doctors or from a company called DNA Direct .
2007_05_01_1844170	0	The basic elements of Minimalism -- tonality , rhythmic regularity , repetition of brief melodic cells -- are reasonably easy to summarize .
2007_05_01_1844170	1	Post-Minimalism is harder to pin down : Composers lumped under this untidy rubric vary widely in style .
2007_05_01_1844170	2	Just how widely was demonstrated in a program presented on Saturday night by the adventurous new-music ensemble Opus 21 , based in Kalamazoo , Mich. , at the Leonard Nimoy Thalia Theater at Symphony Space .
2007_05_01_1844170	3	The tone of the concert was engaging and informal , with most of the composers on hand to introduce their pieces .
2007_05_01_1844170	4	The clarinetist Bradley Wong referred to Steve Reich 's '' New York Counterpoint '' ( 1985 ) as this group 's version of early music .
2007_05_01_1844170	5	Mr. Wong provided an alert account of a piece filled with the rippling rhythms and bubbly melodies that denote Minimalism to most listeners .
2007_05_01_1844170	6	At the opposite extreme was the Dutch composer Louis Andriessen 's '' Klokken voor Haarlem '' ( '' Bells for Haarlem '' ) , from 2002 , in its New York premiere .
2007_05_01_1844170	7	This piece opened with a mildly dissonant three-note theme on piano , celesta , percussion and synthesizer .
2007_05_01_1844170	8	Its tiny , incremental shifts were occasionally interrupted by busy outbursts that suggested the tolling of the hour .
2007_05_01_1844170	9	Even more jarring was David Lang 's '' Stick Figure '' ( 2001 ) , in which Mr. Wong and the cellist Alexa Muhly offered gentle melodic swells and pulsations persistently shattered by harsh explosions from three drummers .
2007_05_01_1844170	10	The pianist Yu-Lien The provided enigmatic counterpoint .
2007_05_01_1844170	11	Several of the young composers commissioned to write works for this program described their initial encounters with Mr. Reich 's music as epiphanies .

2007_05_01_1844171	0	Depression is associated with an increased risk for diabetes in older adults , even in people who have no other risk factors for the disease , a new study reports .
2007_05_01_1844171	1	Researchers studied 4,681 men and women over 65 , following them over a 10-year period , after excluding anyone who already had diabetes at the start of the project .
2007_05_01_1844171	2	They used a well-validated questionnaire to measure symptoms of depression each year , and tested all participants at two - to four-year intervals for blood sugar .
2007_05_01_1844171	3	They also calculated body mass index and noted alcohol intake , smoking status and antidepressant use .
2007_05_01_1844171	4	After controlling for these factors , they found that even a single report of high depressive symptoms was associated with an increase in the incidence of diabetes .
2007_05_01_1844171	5	Increases in symptoms over time and persistently high symptoms of depression were also associated with the disease .
2007_05_01_1844171	6	Over all , people with the highest scores on the depression questionnaire were roughly 50 percent more likely to develop diabetes than those with the lowest scores .
2007_05_01_1844171	7	Adjusting for race , sex , smoking status , alcohol intake and body mass index made no difference in the result .
2007_05_01_1844171	8	Mercedes R. Carnethon , the lead author and an assistant professor of preventive medicine at Northwestern University , said there was no evidence one way or the other on whether treating depression could reduce the risk for diabetes . ''
2007_05_01_1844171	9	People in our study who were on antidepressants did n't have an elevated risk for diabetes , '' she said . ''
2007_05_01_1844171	10	But we do n't know if that 's because of the antidepressants '' or for some other reason .
2007_05_01_1844171	11	The study appeared April 23 in The Archives of Internal Medicine .
2007_05_01_1844171	12	Dr. Jonathan W. Stewart , a research psychiatrist at the New York State Psychiatric Institute who was not involved in the work , said that the conclusions '' fit with what else we think we know , '' but he was troubled by one aspect of the work . ''
2007_05_01_1844171	13	I worry that some of the items on the questionnaire could be attributed to diabetes rather than to depression , '' suggesting that there is some overlap between the symptoms of the two disorders , he said . ''
2007_05_01_1844171	14	This does n't make the study wrong or inaccurate , but it 's a serious limitation which they did n't mention . ''
2007_05_01_1844171	15	Inflammation has been proposed as an explanation for the connection because it is associated with both diabetes and depression .
2007_05_01_1844171	16	But this study found that having higher or lower levels of C-reactive protein , a marker of inflammation , did not alter the association between the two disorders .
2007_05_01_1844171	17	Instead , the authors suggest , other biological mechanisms may be at work in the autonomic nervous system , which controls heart , digestive , respiratory , glandular and other involuntary processes .
2007_05_01_1844171	18	Previous studies have shown that depression is associated with dysfunction in that system , which has also been detected before the development of diabetes .
2007_05_01_1844171	19	The stress response associated with depression may increase the risk for diabetes by decreasing insulin secretion from the pancreas , which then causes increasing glucose levels in the blood .
2007_05_01_1844171	20	This can result in a blood sugar level above normal , the defining characteristic of diabetes .
2007_05_01_1844171	21	The authors acknowledge some weaknesses in their study .
2007_05_01_1844171	22	Measures of physical activity were not consistently available during follow-up , and assumptions about this may have introduced error .
2007_05_01_1844171	23	Also , some of their data were gathered with self-reports , which are not always reliable .
2007_05_01_1844171	24	In addition , while their questionnaire detected depressive symptoms , the researchers were not able to make definitive diagnoses of clinical depression .
2007_05_01_1844171	25	Still , Dr. Carnethon said , depression '' is a novel risk factor for diabetes , so we need to look at factors beyond physical inactivity and diet for an explanation . ''
2007_05_01_1844171	26	Depression is common in older people , she added , and 15 percent of those over 65 have diabetes . ''
2007_05_01_1844171	27	The most important thing to keep in mind , '' Dr. Carnethon said , '' is that depression has a lot of effects on the body , one of which may be the development of diabetes , which can lead to a number of other diseases .
2007_05_01_1844171	28	So addressing depression is important not only for improving mood , but for protecting overall health . ''
2007_05_01_1844172	0	To operate on a patient without receiving a fee is the most satisfying of memories , the greatest of privileges .
2007_05_01_1844172	1	It leaves a glow , a high -- the feeling young doctors must get these days when they go to third-world countries , repair cleft lips and palates , or build hospitals .
2007_05_01_1844172	2	I had those feelings once .
2007_05_01_1844172	3	It was a time of postgraduate training , with a working wife , no children , no malpractice bills , no office expenses .
2007_05_01_1844172	4	Those were the days of my surgical residency at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York , days beginning at 5 a.m. , going without lunch , finishing at 7 or 8 p.m. ( if you had the night off ; your nights on , boy were you on ) .
2007_05_01_1844172	5	The old days , the '50s and early '60s , before anyone belonged to a health maintenance organization : they were the best of times , times of gaining a capacity for hardship and loving it , times of acquiring skills and knowledge , of sucking it all in .
2007_05_01_1844172	6	And patients , especially the ward patients cared for by the resident staff , knew how to thank surgical interns making 25 bucks a month .
2007_05_01_1844172	7	One patient was admitted with an obstructing cancer of the large intestine .
2007_05_01_1844172	8	In his mid-70s , a Chinese grandfather with a family he had nurtured all his life .
2007_05_01_1844172	9	Small , straight with hair the color of smoke , calmly powerful .
2007_05_01_1844172	10	He needed three operations for the colon cancer : the first , a colostomy , to relieve the block ; a second , to remove the tumor ; and finally , the last , to close the colostomy .
2007_05_01_1844172	11	He had little English but knew the value of '' thank you . ''
2007_05_01_1844172	12	A man respected and admired by wife , children , grandchildren -- all attached to the family restaurant business .
2007_05_01_1844172	13	I will always remember .
2007_05_01_1844172	14	After each operation , at 7 to the minute , the evening of surgery , his family arrived at the ward kitchen , a sudden oasis , with enough egg drop soup , sweet-and-sour chicken , orange beef , on and on , to feed the entire surgical staff and a few hungry urologists .
2007_05_01_1844172	15	The dessert was fortune cookies containing special messages of gratitude .
2007_05_01_1844172	16	Over time , from other patients and their families , I received other edibles : cookies , fruitcake every Christmas , fresh-baked breads , pickles , jams , honey , cherry pies , a Gouda as big as a lung .
2007_05_01_1844172	17	Then there were the physical thanks : smiles , tears , shakes , hugs , as digestible and soothing as yogurt .
2007_05_01_1844172	18	I recall removing a colon for ulcerative colitis in a 7 - year-old boy .
2007_05_01_1844172	19	His mother grasped my hands and said '' golden . ''
2007_05_01_1844172	20	Those poor patients gave what they could .
2007_05_01_1844172	21	From the wealthy private patients we got cash , a casual 5 , 10 , 20 , rarely 50 dollars , enough to buy an infrequent Italian dinner for my wife and me .
2007_05_01_1844172	22	Easy for the rich to leave a tip .
2007_05_01_1844172	23	For them we were accessories , the busboys of the hospital , unimportant compared with their attending surgeons .
2007_05_01_1844172	24	Over the decades I have forgotten about delayed payments from insurance companies , arguments about fee schedules , tortured reasoning from administrators , disputes with my associates .
2007_05_01_1844172	25	I have never failed to remember those patients whose thanks made me feel like a real doctor .
2007_05_01_1844172	26	Every time my wife and I go to a Chinese restaurant , I remember the meals I had in the ward kitchen .
2007_05_01_1844172	27	Nothing has tasted as good since then .
2007_05_01_1844172	28	CASES Larry Zaroff teaches medical humanities to undergraduates and medical students at Stanford .
2007_05_01_1844173	0	Everyone loves freebies , and patients are no exception .
2007_05_01_1844173	1	So drug company sales representatives try to keep sample cabinets in medical offices well stocked with the latest medications , for doctors to dispense as the need arises .
2007_05_01_1844173	2	Patients like going home with free samples because it saves them a trip to the drugstore and a co-pay , and doctors are happy to oblige , because samples help patients get started on treatment right away .
2007_05_01_1844173	3	But now some leading academic medical centers are restricting the use of samples , and a smattering of physician practices are shutting down the sample cabinet .
2007_05_01_1844173	4	These critics say doctors should be choosing the most appropriate medication for a patient based on the best scientific evidence available -- not just grabbing something from the office stash that happens to fit the bill . ''
2007_05_01_1844173	5	The doctor will say , ` Here , start on this , and let 's see how it works , ' '' said David J. Rothman , president of the Institute on Medicine as a Profession , a research group at Columbia . ''
2007_05_01_1844173	6	The question to the doctor is : If you did n't have it in your drawer , would that have been your drug of choice ? ''
2007_05_01_1844173	7	The crackdown on free samples comes amid growing concern about the close ties between physicians and drug companies .
2007_05_01_1844173	8	Critics like Dr. Rothman say physicians do n't realize the extent to which their medical judgment is influenced by their acceptance of the samples .
2007_05_01_1844173	9	They point to studies like a 2002 paper in the journal Annals of Family Medicine finding that the number of doctors who treated high blood pressure with the '' first line '' drugs recommended by national guidelines was low , but increased sharply when free samples were removed .
2007_05_01_1844173	10	So far , the University of Michigan Health System has banned free samples altogether , and the University of Pennsylvania and Stanford University medical schools have prohibited staff members from accepting them ( though samples can be given to Stanford 's pharmacy for use in free clinics ) .
2007_05_01_1844173	11	Some medical groups and solo practitioners have also changed their policies .
2007_05_01_1844173	12	Dr. Jonathan Mohrer , an internist in Forest Hills , Queens , said he closed his sample cabinet in part because his office was overrun with sales representatives . ''
2007_05_01_1844173	13	It was totally spinning out of control , '' Dr. Mohrer said . ''
2007_05_01_1844173	14	They were meeting each other and schmoozing in the waiting room -- it was like a party . ''
2007_05_01_1844173	15	His office staff had to spend time arranging the cabinet , throwing out expired medications and rummaging around for the right drug .
2007_05_01_1844173	16	Patients were kept waiting while sales representatives were whisked in .
2007_05_01_1844173	17	But there 's an upside to the samples .
2007_05_01_1844173	18	Using samples , a doctor can see if a patient can tolerate a new medication before the patient goes out and buys a 30-day supply .
2007_05_01_1844173	19	Physicians who treat poor people like to have samples on hand for them , and for uninsured patients .
2007_05_01_1844173	20	Samples also provide patients with the convenience of one-stop shopping , said Dr. Hema A. Sundaram , a dermatologist in suburban Washington . ''
2007_05_01_1844173	21	Usually a patient has waited some time to see a doctor and rearranged their whole working schedule , and then it may be another four or five days before they can fill a prescription , '' she said . ''
2007_05_01_1844173	22	They 're often busy , working people , with family responsibilities .
2007_05_01_1844173	23	I feel there should n't be any further delay . ''
2007_05_01_1844173	24	( Dr. Sundaram acknowledges that she is paid for speaking on behalf of drug companies . )
2007_05_01_1844173	25	And many physicians say they like using samples because the sales representatives are an important source of medical education , helping to keep the doctors up to date on the latest therapies . ''
2007_05_01_1844173	26	Doctors who are shutting the door to sales reps are cutting themselves off from a lot of valuable information , '' said Scott Lassman , senior assistant general counsel for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America , a trade association . ''
2007_05_01_1844173	27	Sales reps can explain when it 's right to use a drug , when it 's not right to use the drug , which patients might benefit and which patients it might not work for . ''
2007_05_01_1844173	28	Some doctors are skeptical . ''
2007_05_01_1844173	29	The sales reps are nice people , and they try to do a really good job , '' said Dr. Judith Chamberlain , medical director of the Bowdoin Medical Group , a practice near Portland , Me. , that banned samples this year . ''
2007_05_01_1844173	30	But their job is to get you to use their product . ''
2007_05_01_1844173	31	A 1995 study in The Journal of the American Medical Association found that 11 percent of the statements drug company representatives made during presentations were inaccurate , and all of the inaccuracies were skewed in favor of their products .
2007_05_01_1844173	32	The drugs promoted through free samples tend to be the newer medications that doctors are less familiar with , experts say .
2007_05_01_1844173	33	Some critics of samples say they prefer using older drugs anyway , because their side effects are better known .
2007_05_01_1844173	34	Critics also point out that helping poor and uninsured patients is not the intent of the sample distribution , and they add that developments like Medicare 's prescription-drug coverage , the proliferation of generic drugs and improvements in drug company patient-assistance programs have eased access to medication .
2007_05_01_1844173	35	As for the bottom line , it 's not at all clear that samples save patients money .
2007_05_01_1844173	36	Critics say they may actually drive up the cost of health care in the long run , because the drugs being promoted are the most expensive brand-name medications .
2007_05_01_1844173	37	Since many conditions require lifelong treatment , the patient would have to buy the medicine sooner or later . ''
2007_05_01_1844173	38	You 're going to be paying more , because you 're taking the new , advanced drug , '' Dr. Rothman said . ''
2007_05_01_1844173	39	And you may have done just fine on the old-fashioned generic . ''
2007_05_01_1844174	0	It was the fall of 1996 , and Boris N. Yeltsin was running for re-election as Russia 's first president in the post-Soviet era .
2007_05_01_1844174	1	But he faced a crisis far more threatening than any opponent : he was desperately ill .
2007_05_01_1844174	2	Mr. Yeltsin had had a heart attack .
2007_05_01_1844174	3	He was experiencing chest pain from angina .
2007_05_01_1844174	4	He needed a coronary bypass operation .
2007_05_01_1844174	5	But his Russian doctors said he could not survive such surgery .
2007_05_01_1844174	6	For independent advice , Mr. Yeltsin reached out to an American doctor as renowned in Russia as he was in the United States : Dr. Michael E. DeBakey , the pioneering Houston heart surgeon .
2007_05_01_1844174	7	Dr. DeBakey agreed to go to Moscow , and after examining Mr. Yeltsin he determined that the Russian leader could indeed survive a bypass operation .
2007_05_01_1844174	8	It was not widely noted in the obituaries for Mr. Yeltsin , who died last week at 76 , but that consultation very likely saved his presidency , if not his life .
2007_05_01_1844174	9	In doing so , it changed the course of history .
2007_05_01_1844174	10	Among other things , if Mr. Yeltsin had not been re-elected , he would never have had the opportunity to reach deep into the Russian bureaucracy to select Vladimir V. Putin , then an obscure functionary , as his successor . ''
2007_05_01_1844174	11	All the doctors agreed Yeltsin would have died if he did not have the bypass , '' Dr. DeBakey said in an interview yesterday . ''
2007_05_01_1844174	12	No question about that , because he was deteriorating and going into early heart failure . ''
2007_05_01_1844174	13	Dr. DeBakey , now 98 , had often visited the Soviet Union during the cold war to lecture on -- and occasionally perform -- the operations and procedures that he had developed .
2007_05_01_1844174	14	But in those days , Kremlin officials would hardly have asked for a consultation with an American surgeon , no matter how eminent . ''
2007_05_01_1844174	15	Calling in Dr. DeBakey was very important , a signal that he was in very serious condition , and consulting with a world leader in surgery this way was almost unthinkable in the Soviet period , '' said Marshall I. Goldman , a Russian expert and senior scholar at Harvard . ''
2007_05_01_1844174	16	It was a measure of Dr. DeBakey 's stature in Russia . ''
2007_05_01_1844174	17	Thomas R. Pickering , who was the United States ambassador to Russia at the time , said it was not clear who would have been elected if Mr. Yeltsin had dropped out of the race .
2007_05_01_1844174	18	Both he and Mr. Goldman said in separate interviews that it could have been a member of the Communist Party .
2007_05_01_1844174	19	Dr. DeBakey has said in interviews , in 1996 and since , that he told Mr. Yeltsin he could withstand a coronary bypass operation after treatment , including transfusions , to correct anemia from internal bleeding and to restore his low thyroid function .
2007_05_01_1844174	20	Despite Mr. Yeltsin 's reputation for excessive drinking , his liver function was normal .
2007_05_01_1844174	21	Mr. Yeltsin immediately asked about his chances of being able to get back to work . ''
2007_05_01_1844174	22	Excellent , possibly in two or so weeks , '' Dr. DeBakey said he replied .
2007_05_01_1844174	23	He then carried out Mr. Yeltsin 's request to give the news to journalists . ''
2007_05_01_1844174	24	The next morning , Mr. Yeltsin 's doctors were kidding me that the Communist Party did not like your report , '' Dr. DeBakey said.Until then , he said , he did not appreciate his recommendation 's political significance .
2007_05_01_1844174	25	Dr. DeBakey said his confidence in Mr. Yeltsin 's ability to undergo bypass surgery was based on an examination far more thorough than the ones the Russian doctors had conducted .
2007_05_01_1844174	26	One of those doctors confirmed that assertion in an interview with me in 1996 , when I went to Moscow to cover the operation for The New York Times .
2007_05_01_1844174	27	Dr. DeBakey told Mr. Yeltsin that he had confidence in the Russian heart surgeon who would eventually perform the quintuple bypass .
2007_05_01_1844174	28	That surgeon , Dr. Renat S. Akchurin , had briefly trained under Dr. DeBakey in Houston .
2007_05_01_1844174	29	Dr. Akchurin initially specialized in microsurgery , wearing jeweler-type loupes and using an operating microscope to magnify the surgical field when repairing human nerves injured in accidents .
2007_05_01_1844174	30	His medical bosses recognized his talent and asked him to become a heart surgeon .
2007_05_01_1844174	31	Mr. Yeltsin insisted on having the operation at Dr. Akchurin 's hospital , even though it did not have all the emergency equipment Dr. DeBakey thought might be needed .
2007_05_01_1844174	32	( Dr. DeBakey knew the hospital because he had consulted on its design . )
2007_05_01_1844174	33	So Dr. DeBakey also promised Mr. Yeltsin that he would watch the bypass operation and bring a team that included his surgical partner , Dr. George P. Noon , along with the equipment in case it was needed .
2007_05_01_1844174	34	Mr. Yeltsin 's medical team followed Dr. DeBakey 's advice to correct the thyroid and other problems to prepare him for the bypass operation .
2007_05_01_1844174	35	A key monitor of heart function is the ejection fraction , a test that measures the proportion of blood ejected from the main chamber of the heart in each beat .
2007_05_01_1844174	36	After the medical tuneup , Mr. Yeltsin 's ejection fraction rose significantly , to 40 from the high 20s .
2007_05_01_1844174	37	After the operation , the fraction improved to 50 , good but still a bit less than normal .
2007_05_01_1844174	38	As a patient , Mr. Yeltsin '' was not as bossy with me as he was with some of his Russian doctors , '' Dr. DeBakey said , adding : '' He did n't get along with some of the doctors there .
2007_05_01_1844174	39	But he took a liking to me , listened , and that made things much better . '' ''
2007_05_01_1844174	40	I 'll do what you say if you can put me back in my office , '' Dr. DeBakey said Mr. Yeltsin told him .
2007_05_01_1844174	41	Dr. DeBakey said he and the Russian doctors set a return to office date '' a few days ahead of time , '' in part because he was recovering well and had access to around-the-clock care .
2007_05_01_1844174	42	Two weeks after his return , Mr. Yeltsin was treated for pneumonia .
2007_05_01_1844174	43	Although Dr. DeBakey last spoke with Mr. Yeltsin on a visit to Moscow in May 2004 , doctors kept him posted on Mr. Yeltsin 's medical progress .
2007_05_01_1844174	44	A few years ago , after Mr. Yeltsin developed symptoms of further heart trouble , doctors at the Berlin Heart Center in Germany performed an angioplasty .
2007_05_01_1844174	45	Dr. Roland Hetzer , who led the German team , called Dr. DeBakey the next day to report that the five grafts that Dr. Akchurin had sewn in Mr. Yeltsin 's heart had remained open and functioning well .
2007_05_01_1844174	46	But the German team had to clear blockages and place stents in two other areas of Mr. Yeltsin 's coronary arteries .
2007_05_01_1844174	47	As often happens , his coronary artery disease had become progressive , Dr. DeBakey said .
2007_05_01_1844174	48	Considering the amount of heart damage Mr. Yeltsin had suffered before the bypass , Dr. DeBakey estimated in 1996 that the surgery would allow Mr. Yeltsin to live comfortably for 10 to 15 years -- or as he put it last week , '' We gave him 10 1/2 years . ''
2007_05_01_1844174	49	Russian officials have not reported whether an autopsy was performed .
2007_05_01_1844174	50	The Kremlin 's choice of Dr. DeBakey was based on contacts he made among Russian officials over the half-century since he befriended a small group of Soviet doctors who sat by themselves at a surgical meeting in Mexico in the 1950s .
2007_05_01_1844174	51	Dr. DeBakey took them to lunch and invited them to watch him operate in Houston on their way home .
2007_05_01_1844174	52	Later , his guests invited Dr. DeBakey to speak at a surgical meeting in Moscow and then translated his text into Russian .
2007_05_01_1844174	53	It was the first of more than 20 trips that Dr. DeBakey said he made to the Soviet Union .
2007_05_01_1844174	54	On one trip , in 1973 , Dr. DeBakey performed a quintuple bypass on Mstislav V. Keldysh , a nuclear scientist and president of the Soviet Academy of Science .
2007_05_01_1844174	55	A year later , the nation 's Academy of Medical Sciences elected Dr. DeBakey a foreign member .
2007_05_01_1844174	56	My requests for interviews with Mr. Yeltsin were always denied , so I was never able to ask him about Dr. DeBakey .
2007_05_01_1844174	57	But in a foreword to the Russian edition of Dr. DeBakey 's book '' The New Living Heart '' ( Adams , 1997 ) , written with Antonio Gotto Jr. , Mr. Yeltsin described Dr. DeBakey as '' a magician of the heart '' and '' a man with a gift for performing miracles . ''
2007_05_01_1844175	0	THE CLAIM -- Heat wraps ease back pain .
2007_05_01_1844175	1	THE FACTS -- About half of all working-age Americans experience chronic back pain at some point .
2007_05_01_1844175	2	For relief , many people turn to heat therapy , a cheap and age-old home remedy .
2007_05_01_1844175	3	But how effective is it ?
2007_05_01_1844175	4	Over the years , dozens of studies have sought an answer .
2007_05_01_1844175	5	Most have found that applying heat in the early stages of an episode provides short-term relief , increasing mobility and reducing pain by dilating blood vessels and relaxing stiffness .
2007_05_01_1844175	6	One of the largest studies looked at nine previous studies of nearly 1,200 people .
2007_05_01_1844175	7	The analysis , published in The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews , found that five days of heat therapy -- mostly in the form of wraps -- significantly reduced pain after five days compared with oral placebos and other remedies .
2007_05_01_1844175	8	There was less evidence for the reverse technique , cold therapy , though many doctors swear by it .
2007_05_01_1844175	9	But combining therapies may be the best approach .
2007_05_01_1844175	10	One large , randomized study in 2005 , for example , compared various treatments and found that after seven days , about 70 percent of subjects who combined heat therapy with light exercise returned to '' pre-injury function , '' compared with 20 percent who used heat or exercise alone .
2007_05_01_1844175	11	Bed rest , however , seems to be another story .
2007_05_01_1844175	12	Most studies have found that it helps at first but that after two days it begins to do harm , weakening muscles and increasing the risk of blood clots .
2007_05_01_1844175	13	THE BOTTOM LINE -- At least in the short term , heat therapy appears to relieve back pain .
2007_05_01_1844176	0	'' This guy 's the champion , '' said Patricia Brennan , a behavioral ecologist , leaning over the nether regions of a duck -- a Meller 's duck from Madagascar , to be specific -- and carefully coaxing out his phallus .
2007_05_01_1844176	1	The duck was quietly resting upside-down against the stomach of Ian Gereg , an aviculturist here at the Livingston Ripley Waterfowl Sanctuary .
2007_05_01_1844176	2	Dr. Brennan , a post-doctoral researcher at Yale University and the University of Sheffield , visits the sanctuary every two weeks to measure the phalluses of six species of ducks .
2007_05_01_1844176	3	When she first visited in January , the phalluses were the size of rice grains .
2007_05_01_1844176	4	Now many of them are growing rapidly .
2007_05_01_1844176	5	The champion phallus from this Meller 's duck is a long , spiraling tentacle .
2007_05_01_1844176	6	Some ducks grow phalluses as long as their entire body .
2007_05_01_1844176	7	In the fall , the genitalia will disappear , only to reappear next spring .
2007_05_01_1844176	8	The anatomy of ducks is especially bizarre considering that 97 percent of all bird species have no phallus at all .
2007_05_01_1844176	9	Most male birds just deliver their sperm through an opening .
2007_05_01_1844176	10	Dr. Brennan is investigating how this sexual wonder of the world came to be .
2007_05_01_1844176	11	Part of the answer , she has discovered , has gone overlooked for decades .
2007_05_01_1844176	12	Male ducks may have such extreme genitals because the females do too .
2007_05_01_1844176	13	The birds are locked in an evolutionary struggle for reproductive success .
2007_05_01_1844176	14	Dr. Brennan was oblivious to bird phalluses until 1999 .
2007_05_01_1844176	15	While working in a Costa Rican forest , she observed a pair of birds called tinamous mating . ''
2007_05_01_1844176	16	They became unattached , and I saw this huge thing hanging off of him , '' she said . ''
2007_05_01_1844176	17	I could not believe it .
2007_05_01_1844176	18	It became one of those questions I wrote down : why do these males have this huge phallus ? ''
2007_05_01_1844176	19	A bird phallus is similar -- but not identical -- to a mammalian penis .
2007_05_01_1844176	20	Most of the time it remains invisible , curled up inside a bird 's body .
2007_05_01_1844176	21	During mating , however , it fills with lymphatic fluid and expands into a long , corkscrew shape .
2007_05_01_1844176	22	The bird 's sperm travels on the outside of the phallus , along a spiral-shaped groove , into the female bird .
2007_05_01_1844176	23	To lean about this peculiar organ , Dr. Brennan decided she would have to make careful dissections of male tinamous .
2007_05_01_1844176	24	In 2005 she traveled to the University of Sheffield to learn the art of bird dissection from Tim Birkhead , an evolutionary biologist .
2007_05_01_1844176	25	Dr. Birkhead had her practice on some male ducks from a local farm .
2007_05_01_1844176	26	Gazing at the enormous organs , she asked herself a question that apparently no one had asked before . ''
2007_05_01_1844176	27	So what does the female look like ? ''
2007_05_01_1844176	28	Obviously you ca n't have something like that without some place to put it in .
2007_05_01_1844176	29	You need a garage to park the car . ''
2007_05_01_1844176	30	The lower oviduct ( the equivalent of the vagina in birds ) is typically a simple tube .
2007_05_01_1844176	31	But when Dr. Brennan dissected some female ducks , she discovered they had a radically different anatomy . ''
2007_05_01_1844176	32	There were all these weird structures , these pockets and spirals , '' she said .
2007_05_01_1844176	33	Somehow , generations of biologists had never noticed this anatomy before .
2007_05_01_1844176	34	Pondering it , Dr. Brennan came to doubt the conventional explanation for how duck phalluses evolved .
2007_05_01_1844176	35	In some species of ducks , a female bonds for a season with a male .
2007_05_01_1844176	36	But she is also harassed by other males that force her to mate . ''
2007_05_01_1844176	37	It 's nasty business .
2007_05_01_1844176	38	Females are often killed or injured , '' Dr. Brennan said .
2007_05_01_1844176	39	Species with more forced mating tend to have longer phalluses .
2007_05_01_1844176	40	That link led some scientists to argue that the duck phallus was the result of males ' competing with one another to fertilize eggs . ''
2007_05_01_1844176	41	Basically , you get a bigger phallus to put your sperm in farther than the other males , '' Dr. Brennan said .
2007_05_01_1844176	42	Dr. Brennan realized that scientists had made this argument without looking at the female birds .
2007_05_01_1844176	43	Perhaps , she wondered , the two sexes were coevolving , with elaborate lower oviducts driving the evolution of long phalluses .
2007_05_01_1844176	44	To test this idea , Dr. Brennan traveled to Alaska .
2007_05_01_1844176	45	Many species of waterfowl breed there , with a wide range of mating systems .
2007_05_01_1844176	46	Working with Kevin McCracken of the University of Alaska and his colleagues , she caught and dissected 16 species of ducks and geese , comparing the male and female anatomy .
2007_05_01_1844176	47	If a male bird had a long phallus , the female tended to have a more elaborate lower oviduct .
2007_05_01_1844176	48	And if the male had a small phallus , the female tended to have a simple oviduct . ''
2007_05_01_1844176	49	The correlation was incredibly tight , '' Dr. Brennan said . ''
2007_05_01_1844176	50	When you dissected one of the birds , it was really easy to predict what the other sex was going to look like . ''
2007_05_01_1844176	51	Dr. Brennan and her colleagues are publishing their study today in the journal PLOS One .
2007_05_01_1844176	52	Dr. McCracken , who discovered the longest known bird phallus on an Argentine duck in 2001 , is struck by the fact that it was a woman who discovered the complexity of female birds . ''
2007_05_01_1844176	53	Maybe it 's the male bias we all have , '' he said . ''
2007_05_01_1844176	54	It 's just been out there , waiting to be discovered . ''
2007_05_01_1844176	55	Dr. Brennan argues that elaborate female duck anatomy evolves as a countermeasure against aggressive males . ''
2007_05_01_1844176	56	Once they choose a male , they 're making the best possible choice , and that 's the male they want siring their offspring , '' she said . ''
2007_05_01_1844176	57	They do n't want the guy flying in from who knows where .
2007_05_01_1844176	58	It makes sense that they would develop a defense . ''
2007_05_01_1844176	59	Female ducks seem to be equipped to block the sperm of unwanted males .
2007_05_01_1844176	60	Their lower oviduct is spiraled like the male phallus , for example , but it turns in the opposite direction .
2007_05_01_1844176	61	Dr. Brennan suspects that the female ducks can force sperm into one of the pockets and then expel it . ''
2007_05_01_1844176	62	It only makes sense as a barrier , '' she said .
2007_05_01_1844176	63	To support her argument , Dr. Brennan notes studies on some species that have found that forced matings make up about a third of all matings .
2007_05_01_1844176	64	Yet only 3 percent of the offspring are the result of forced matings . ''
2007_05_01_1844176	65	To me , it means these females are successful with this strategy , '' she said .
2007_05_01_1844176	66	Dr. Brennan suspects that when the females of a species evolved better defenses , they drove the evolution of male phalluses . ''
2007_05_01_1844176	67	The males have to step up to produce a longer or more flexible phallus , '' she said .
2007_05_01_1844176	68	Other scientists have documented a similar coevolution of genitals in flies and other invertebrates .
2007_05_01_1844176	69	But Dr. Brennan 's study is the clearest example of this arms race in vertebrates . ''
2007_05_01_1844176	70	It 's rare to find something so blatantly obvious in the female anatomy , '' Dr. Brennan said . ''
2007_05_01_1844176	71	I 'm sure it 's going on in other vertebrates , but it 's probably going in ways that are more subtle and harder to figure out . ''
2007_05_01_1844176	72	To test her hypothesis , Dr. Brennan plans to team up with a biomechanics expert to build a transparent model of a female duck .
2007_05_01_1844176	73	She wants to see exactly what a duck phallus does during mating .
2007_05_01_1844176	74	Dr. Brennan also hopes to find more clues by studying phalluses on living ducks .
2007_05_01_1844176	75	At the waterfowl sanctuary in Litchfield , she is spending the year tracking the growth and disappearance of phalluses in ducks and geese .
2007_05_01_1844176	76	Hardly anything is known about how the phallus waxes and wanes -- not to mention why . ''
2007_05_01_1844176	77	It may be easier to regrow it than to keep it healthy , '' Dr. Brennan said . ''
2007_05_01_1844176	78	But those are some of the things I may be able to find out .
2007_05_01_1844176	79	When you 're doing something that so little is known about , you ca n't really predict what 's going to happen . ''
2007_05_01_1844177	0	Why is it that when people are yakking away on their cellphones , they often accompany their activity with face and hand gestures , a performance that their distant listener can not see and does not need ?
2007_05_01_1844177	1	Gesture seems so integral a part of human communication that some researchers have wondered if language began as a system of signs and switched over to speech later in human evolutionary history .
2007_05_01_1844177	2	Gesture , after all , is certainly capable of supporting full-fledged language , as is shown by the existence of sign languages .
2007_05_01_1844177	3	So it is of interest that chimpanzees and bonobos also make liberal use of gestures in addition to the sounds and facial expressions that are part of their communication system .
2007_05_01_1844177	4	Writing in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , published today , Amy S. Pollick and Frans B. M. de Waal of the Yerkes National Primate Research Center report that the two species use gestures in a much more flexible way than facial or vocal signals .
2007_05_01_1844177	5	A scream always means that someone is under threat or attack .
2007_05_01_1844177	6	But the gesture of stretching out an open hand depends on context .
2007_05_01_1844177	7	In a fight , it is used as a call for help to a third party .
2007_05_01_1844177	8	But it may also be used toward a chimp with food to suggest that a modicum of sharing would be appropriate .
2007_05_01_1844177	9	With one exception , hand gestures are not seen in monkeys , Dr. de Waal said , suggesting that they are a more recent evolutionary development than other components of communication like sounds and expressions and could more easily be co-opted into a symbolic system .
2007_05_01_1844177	10	The versatility of the 31 hand gestures seen among chimpanzees and bonobos '' makes gesture a serious candidate modality to have acquired symbolic meaning '' in early human ancestors , the researchers write .
2007_05_01_1844177	11	Bonobos , which became a separate species from chimpanzees 2.5 million years ago , seem to make special use of hand gestures that elicit a response from other bonobos much more often when included in the mix of sounds and expressions .
2007_05_01_1844177	12	The openness of the hand-gesture system among chimps and bonobos '' is consistent with the idea that the early hominid communications system was gesture based and that vocal communication came later , '' said William Hopkins , a Yerkes researcher not involved in the study . ''
2007_05_01_1844177	13	The speech system is a very recent adaptation in hominids . ''
2007_05_01_1844177	14	Marc D. Hauser , an expert on animal communication at Harvard , said the work on hand gestures was interesting but in his view had nothing to do with language . ''
2007_05_01_1844177	15	At some point in primate evolution , '' he said , '' those parts of the body became usable in systems of communication , and we inherited some aspects of that , as did chimps .
2007_05_01_1844177	16	But we are not licensed to make any connections with language . ''
2007_05_01_1844177	17	The human use of gestures , he added , is not linguistic but to enhance language .
2007_05_01_1844178	0	In Detecting Mass , One Laboratory Mimics the Diving Board Picture a diving board that is oscillating regularly , its tip going up and down .
2007_05_01_1844178	1	Climb on it and what happens ?
2007_05_01_1844178	2	Your mass dampens the oscillations , reducing their frequency and height .
2007_05_01_1844178	3	That 's the principle behind an analytical device developed by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
2007_05_01_1844178	4	Only their '' diving board '' is a cantilever of silicon , just one-fifth of a millimeter long and much thinner , made to oscillate electrostatically .
2007_05_01_1844178	5	And instead of putting mass on top , they put it in a U-shaped channel inside the cantilever .
2007_05_01_1844178	6	The result is an easy-to-fabricate , robust device that could be used to detect biomolecules , say , or nanoparticles , by measuring minute changes in the oscillations of the cantilever as the molecules or particles flow inside it , adding mass .
2007_05_01_1844178	7	Scott R. Manalis , an M.I.T. professor in whose lab the device was developed ( and who is a co-author of a paper in Nature describing it ) , said no one had figured out how to make a cantilever mass-detection tool work at a high level of sensitivity in a liquid , a necessity for biological assays .
2007_05_01_1844178	8	It would be like having a diving board underwater , he said : the liquid dampens the oscillations too much .
2007_05_01_1844178	9	His team 's solution was to put the liquid inside the cantilever by fabricating the enclosed channel . ''
2007_05_01_1844178	10	It was an ` Aha ! '
2007_05_01_1844178	11	moment , '' he said .
2007_05_01_1844178	12	The cantilever can work two ways .
2007_05_01_1844178	13	To detect a specific antigen , for example , the channel walls could be coated with an antibody that binds with it .
2007_05_01_1844178	14	As the antigen molecules traveled through the channel they would accumulate , adding mass to the cantilever and eventually affecting the oscillation frequency .
2007_05_01_1844178	15	A more novel approach could measure relatively large single particles traveling through the channel .
2007_05_01_1844178	16	As a particle moved toward the tip of the cantilever , it would affect the oscillations to a greater degree .
2007_05_01_1844178	17	Measuring that dip in frequency would give the particle 's mass .
2007_05_01_1844178	18	Dr. Manalis said that with either method , the channeled cantilever holds promise as an analytical tool .
2007_05_01_1844178	19	Most current biomolecule detection systems involve optics , which can make them both expensive and delicate .
2007_05_01_1844178	20	A cantilever device should be relatively inexpensive to make and robust enough for field use , he said .
2007_05_01_1844178	21	Instead of Leaping , Sumatran Orangutans Sway From Tree to Tree For animals that spend most of their time in trees , getting around can be costly .
2007_05_01_1844178	22	Jumping the gap from a thin branch to another tree can be inefficient ( not to mention risky ) , because the bending branch absorbs some of the jump energy .
2007_05_01_1844178	23	Another option is climbing down one tree and up the other , but this takes energy , too .
2007_05_01_1844178	24	Orangutans in Sumatra take a third approach : they cause the entire tree to sway until the top is close enough to a neighboring tree for the animal to reach a branch or vine .
2007_05_01_1844178	25	While tree-swaying might seem to be the most labor-intensive technique of all , a study by Susannah K. Thorpe of the University of Birmingham in England and colleagues shows that it uses about half the energy of a typical jump , and about a tenth or less of the energy expended in climbing up another tree or vine .
2007_05_01_1844178	26	Dr. Thorpe videotaped wild orangutans in the Gunung Leuser National Park , and calculated energy costs based on the weight of the animal , its height on the tree , the thickness of the trunk and the amount of sway .
2007_05_01_1844178	27	The findings were reported in Biology Letters .
2007_05_01_1844178	28	Sumatra orangutans are preyed upon by tigers , so they spend almost all their time in trees .
2007_05_01_1844178	29	Tree swaying ( and a few other observed movements that also rely on tree and branch bending ) is a way to avoid having to descend to the ground . ''
2007_05_01_1844178	30	Our study shows that not only do these forms of gap crossing increase safety , '' Dr. Thorpe said , '' but they also decrease the cost of crossing the gap . ''
2007_05_01_1844178	31	Looks Like a Tree Fossil But Acted Like a Fungus , Researchers Discover Among fossils , few are stranger than that of Prototaxites , which lived about 400 million years ago .
2007_05_01_1844178	32	The fossils are like tree trunks -- about 3 feet in diameter and up to 25 feet long -- but Prototaxites is unlike any known tree , living or extinct .
2007_05_01_1844178	33	In fact , it is unlike most anything , and scientists have never been sure if it was a lichen , a giant alga , a fungus or something else entirely .
2007_05_01_1844178	34	Now isotopic analysis of fossils from Ontario and Quebec strongly suggest that '' giant fungus '' is the proper description .
2007_05_01_1844178	35	The analysis , by C. Kevin Boyce of the University of Chicago and colleagues , shows that Prototaxites probably dined off other living things , as a fungus would .
2007_05_01_1844178	36	The findings are published in the journal Geology .
2007_05_01_1844178	37	The researchers looked at concentrations of carbon isotopes in the fossils .
2007_05_01_1844178	38	Isotopic concentrations in some fossils , for example , approximated those in fossil plants from the same area , indicating that Prototaxites consumed land plants .
2007_05_01_1844178	39	Other fossils from other locations had different concentrations of isotopes , and in those cases , the researchers suggest , the fungus may have consumed microbes in soil crusts .

2007_05_01_1844179	1	As it happens , the above precis refers not only to the noble profession of motherhood to which we all owe our lives and guilt complexes .
2007_05_01_1844179	2	It is also a decent character sketch of the chromosome that allows a human or any other mammal to become a mother in the first place : the X chromosome .
2007_05_01_1844179	3	The X chromosome , like its shorter , stubbier but no less conspicuous counterpart , the Y chromosome , is a so-called sex chromosome , a segment of DNA entrusted with the pivotal task of sex determination .
2007_05_01_1844179	4	A mammalian embryo outfitted with an X and Y chromosomal set buds into a male , while a mammal bearing a pair of X chromosomes emerges from the maternal berth with birthing options of her own .
2007_05_01_1844179	5	Yet the X chromosome does much more than help specify an animal 's reproductive plumbing .
2007_05_01_1844179	6	As scientists who study the chromosome lately have learned , the X is a rich repository of genes vital to brain development and could hold the key to the evolution of our particularly corrugated cortex .
2007_05_01_1844179	7	Moreover , the X chromosome behaves unlike any of the other chromosomes of the body -- unlike little big-man Y , certainly , but also unlike our 22 other pairs of chromosomes , the self-satisfied autosomes that constitute the rest of our genome , of the complete DNA kit packed into every cell that we carry .
2007_05_01_1844179	8	It is a supple , switchbacking , multitasking gumby doll patch of the genome ; and the closer you look , the more Cirque du Soleil it appears .
2007_05_01_1844179	9	Although the precise details of its chemical structure and performance are only just emerging , the X chromosome has long been renowned among geneticists , who named it X not because of its shape , as is commonly presumed -- the non-sex chromosomes also vaguely resemble an '' X '' at times during cell division -- but because they were baffled by the way it held itself apart from the other chromosomal pairs . ''
2007_05_01_1844179	10	They called it X for unknown , '' said Mark T. Ross of the X Chromosome Group at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in Cambridge .
2007_05_01_1844179	11	( When its much tinier male counterpart was finally detected , researchers simply continued down the alphabet for a name . )
2007_05_01_1844179	12	Many of the diseases first understood to be hereditary were linked to X 's span , for the paradoxical reason that such conditions showed their face most often in those with just a single X to claim : men .
2007_05_01_1844179	13	Scientists eventually determined that we inherit two copies of our 23,000 or so genes , one from each parent ; and that these genes , these chemical guidelines for how to build and maintain a human , are scattered among the 23 pairs of chromosomes , along with unseemly amounts of apparent chemical babble .
2007_05_01_1844179	14	Having two copies of every gene proves especially handy when one of those paired genes is defective , at which point the working version of the gene can step in and specify enough of the essential bodybuilding protein that the baby blooms just fine and may never know its DNA is hemi-flawed .
2007_05_01_1844179	15	And here is where the Y 's petite stature looms large .
2007_05_01_1844179	16	Because it holds a mere 50ish different genes against its counterpart 's 1,100 , the vast majority of X-based genes have no potential pinch-hitter on the Y .
2007_05_01_1844179	17	A boy who inherits from his mother an X chromosome that enfolds a faulty gene for a bloodclotting factor , say , or for a muscle protein or for a color receptor wo n't find succor in the chromosomal analogue bestowed by Dad .
2007_05_01_1844179	18	He will be born with hemophilia , or muscular dystrophy , or color-blindness .
2007_05_01_1844179	19	But , hey , he will be a boy , for male-making is the task to which the Y chromosome is almost exclusively devoted .
2007_05_01_1844179	20	In fact , it is to compensate for the monomania of the Y that the X chromosome has become such a mother of a multitasker .
2007_05_01_1844179	21	Over the 300 million years of evolution , as the Y chromosome has shrugged off more of its generic genetic responsibilities in pursuit of sexual specialization , the X has had to pick up the slack .
2007_05_01_1844179	22	It , too , has pawned off genes to other chromosomes .
2007_05_01_1844179	23	But for those genes still in its charge , the X must double their output , to prod each gene to spool out twice the protein of an ordinary gene and thus be the solo equivalent of any twinned genes located on other , nonsexy chromosomes .
2007_05_01_1844179	24	Ah , but women , who have two X chromosomes , two copies of those 1,100 genes : What of them ?
2007_05_01_1844179	25	With its usual Seussian sense of playfulness , evolution has opted to zeedo the hoofenanny .
2007_05_01_1844179	26	In a girl 's cells , you do n't see two pleasantly active X chromosomes behaving like two ordinary nonsex chromosomes .
2007_05_01_1844179	27	You see one hyperactive X chromosome , its genes busily pumping out twice the standard issue of protein , just as in a boy 's cells ; and you see one X chromosome that has been largely though not wholly shut down , said Laura Carrel , a geneticist at Penn State College of Medicine .
2007_05_01_1844179	28	Through an elaborate process called X inactivation , the chromosome is blanketed with a duct tape of nucleic acid .
2007_05_01_1844179	29	In some cells of a woman 's body it may be the chromosome from Dad that 's muffled , while in other cells the maternal one stays mum .
2007_05_01_1844179	30	Every daughter , then , is a walking mosaic of clamorous and quiet chromosomes , of fatherly sermons and maternal advice , while every son has but his mother 's voice to guide him .
2007_05_01_1844179	31	Remember this , fellows : you are all mama 's boys .
2007_05_01_1844180	0	Shousun C. Szu , a scientist at the National Institutes of Health , says the best way to prevent people from being poisoned by deadly E. coli would be to vaccinate all infants against the bacteria .
2007_05_01_1844180	1	Graeme McRae , a Canadian biotechnology executive , says it would be more practical to inoculate cows instead .
2007_05_01_1844180	2	Vaccines for people and for cattle are just two approaches under development to prevent or treat food poisoning by the strain E. coli O157 : H7 .
2007_05_01_1844180	3	Right now , scientists can do little medically to fight the pathogen , which was responsible for two severe outbreaks last fall , one from contaminated bagged spinach and a second from tainted lettuce served in chain taco restaurants .
2007_05_01_1844180	4	The main approach has been to try to prevent contamination through careful handling , rigorous inspections and government regulation .
2007_05_01_1844180	5	Slaughterhouses have already sharply reduced contamination through practices like washing carcasses with hot water , steam or acids .
2007_05_01_1844180	6	Now the focus is on new procedures and regulations for the fresh-produce industry .
2007_05_01_1844180	7	Some researchers say medical approaches could eventually supplement food-processing measures .
2007_05_01_1844180	8	To pave the way , an advisory committee of the Food and Drug Administration met on April 12 to discuss how to run clinical trials of drugs to treat E. coli infections .
2007_05_01_1844180	9	On the animal side , a vaccine for cattle developed by Mr. McRae 's company , Bioniche Life Sciences , was approved in December for distribution to veterinarians in Canada .
2007_05_01_1844180	10	Studies have shown that the vaccine can reduce but not eliminate the E. coli shed into manure .
2007_05_01_1844180	11	Not only does that make the cows cleaner as they go into the slaughterhouse , but it could also conceivably reduce the risk that the germ will spread from a feedlot to a nearby produce field though water or wild animals .
2007_05_01_1844180	12	Cows and their manure are considered the major sources of the pathogen . ''
2007_05_01_1844180	13	If we can reduce the likelihood that animals are going to carry the bacteria , then we might reduce over time what they put out into the environment , '' said Guy Loneragan , a veterinary epidemiologist at West Texas A&M University , who has received financing from the beef industry .
2007_05_01_1844180	14	Other methods being tested include cattle antibiotics , an industrial chemical , bacterial-killing viruses and friendly bacteria to displace the evil ones .
2007_05_01_1844180	15	One big potential barrier is that ranchers and feedlots may have little incentive to pay for such treatments , because they do not make the cows grow faster .
2007_05_01_1844180	16	Nor do they keep the cows healthy , because O157 does not sicken the cows that harbor it . ''
2007_05_01_1844180	17	The cattle industry is within pennies of making a profit or not , '' said Carolyn Hovde Bohach , a professor of microbiology at the University of Idaho who is working on a different E. coli vaccine for cattle . ''
2007_05_01_1844180	18	Would it be their responsibility to protect vegetables ? ''
2007_05_01_1844180	19	Efforts to develop drugs and vaccines for people also face barriers .
2007_05_01_1844180	20	Because outbreaks are rare and sporadic , for instance , it would be difficult to test such treatments in clinical trials .
2007_05_01_1844180	21	It might be hard to diagnose the infection in time to intervene medically .
2007_05_01_1844180	22	And any treatment would have to be very safe , because it would be given to children and because most people improve without any intervention .
2007_05_01_1844180	23	E. coli O157 : H7 causes 75,000 cases of infection and 61 deaths in the United States each year , according to a 1999 estimate by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention posted on its Web site .
2007_05_01_1844180	24	The actual number of confirmed cases has dropped since then , particularly in 2003 and 2004 , but increased in 2005 and 2006 , in part because of the outbreaks tied to spinach and lettuce .
2007_05_01_1844180	25	As few as 10 bacteria can make someone ill .
2007_05_01_1844180	26	The bacteria release one or two potent toxins that cause bloody diarrhea .
2007_05_01_1844180	27	In 15 percent of children younger than 10 , and more rarely for adults , the infection causes hemolytic uremic syndrome , in which red blood cells are destroyed and the kidneys fail .
2007_05_01_1844180	28	In a small percentage of such cases , the syndrome proves fatal .
2007_05_01_1844180	29	Dr. Phillip I. Tarr , an expert at Washington University in St. Louis , says treatment is difficult because the bloody diarrhea that signals infection may not occur until three to four days after ingestion of the bacteria .
2007_05_01_1844180	30	By then , a patient could be well on the way to kidney failure .
2007_05_01_1844180	31	Antibiotics , the usual treatment for bacterial infection , only make things worse by killing the bacteria and releasing more of their toxin , Dr. Tarr said .
2007_05_01_1844180	32	He added that the sole treatment shown to reduce the severity of kidney problems was intravenous fluids .
2007_05_01_1844180	33	Other scientists are trying .
2007_05_01_1844180	34	Thallion Pharmaceuticals of Montreal and Teijin Pharma of Japan have separately developed monoclonal antibodies that can latch on to the toxin molecules and neutralize them .
2007_05_01_1844180	35	Monoclonal antibodies , a synthetic version of the body 's own infection fighters , are commonly used to treat cancer and other diseases .
2007_05_01_1844180	36	Thallion and Teijin have shown that the antibodies can protect laboratory animals from lethal doses and have conducted preliminary safety testing in people .
2007_05_01_1844180	37	But at the recent F.D.A. advisory committee meeting , both said it would be prohibitively expensive to test whether their drugs could prevent hemolytic uremic syndrome .
2007_05_01_1844180	38	Some outside scientists question whether a treatment that starts after the toxin is already in the bloodstream would be effective .
2007_05_01_1844180	39	Dr. Szu of the health institutes said a better approach would be to vaccinate people so their immune systems could dispense with the bacteria before they had a chance to multiply and release their toxin in the bloodstream .
2007_05_01_1844180	40	She and colleagues have developed a vaccine made of the complex sugar that is on the surface of the bacteria , the very O-type polysaccharide that gives O157 its name .
2007_05_01_1844180	41	The sugar is linked to a protein taken from another bacterium to make it more potent in stimulating the immune system .
2007_05_01_1844180	42	Dr. Szu and collaborators have tested the vaccine on adult volunteers and on children 2 to 5 .
2007_05_01_1844180	43	The volunteers were not exposed to O157 -- that would be unethical -- but they developed antibodies to it .
2007_05_01_1844180	44	Moreover , when the bacteria were exposed in the laboratory to blood samples from vaccinated people , the microbes were killed .
2007_05_01_1844180	45	Dr. Szu said the next test would be in infants .
2007_05_01_1844180	46	The vaccine is years from the market .
2007_05_01_1844180	47	As with drugs , testing effectiveness would be difficult , and some experts say it may not make sense to vaccinate every child to protect a small number . ''
2007_05_01_1844180	48	A lot of the economics of it would not be very favorable , '' said James B. Kaper , an expert on O157 at the Center for Vaccine Development at the University of Maryland .
2007_05_01_1844180	49	Dr. Szu disagreed , saying , '' All human lives are precious , especially if you talk to parents who lost their children . ''
2007_05_01_1844180	50	The cattle vaccine developed by Bioniche is based on the work of B. Brett Finlay of the University of British Columbia , who helped discover how O157 bacteria attach themselves to the cattle intestines , where they can then multiply .
2007_05_01_1844180	51	The bacteria use a type of microscopic syringe to shoot proteins into the cells lining the intestine , and the cells erect a protein pedestal , to which the bacteria can bind .
2007_05_01_1844180	52	The Bioniche vaccine consists of proteins involved in the attachment .
2007_05_01_1844180	53	The idea is that the cow 's immune system would make antibodies to attack the proteins , thereby blocking the attachment .
2007_05_01_1844180	54	The bacteria could still pass through the cow and into manure .
2007_05_01_1844180	55	But if they could not colonize , their levels should remain low .
2007_05_01_1844180	56	Tests at the University of Nebraska found that the vaccine reduced by 70 percent the number of cows shedding O157 into their manure , said Rodney A. Moxley , a professor of veterinary science there .
2007_05_01_1844180	57	Mr. McRae , president of Bioniche in Belleville , Ontario , said the company would begin to distribute the vaccine in Canada in June or July after it increases manufacturing capacity .
2007_05_01_1844180	58	The approval there is conditional , and the company has to provide more data showing that the vaccine works .
2007_05_01_1844180	59	Mr. McRae said he hoped to obtain approval to sell the vaccine in the United States from the Agriculture Department this year .
2007_05_01_1844180	60	He said feedlots would be charged no more than $ 2.20 a dose , with two doses needed .
2007_05_01_1844180	61	Randall D. Huffman , vice president for scientific affairs at the American Meat Institute , which represents beef processors , said that the cost was '' not trivial '' and that the vaccine '' might not be right for everyone , '' because it was not 100 percent effective .
2007_05_01_1844180	62	Still , Mr. Huffman said , '' If there is technology that is proven effective and is reasonable in cost , I think you 'll see it adopted . ''
2007_05_01_1844180	63	His organization and the National Cattlemen 's Beef Association helped pay for the research on the vaccine and other approaches to reducing the shedding of O157 .
2007_05_01_1844180	64	One approach already in use is probiotics , the idea that friendly bacteria fed to cattle will displace O157 .
2007_05_01_1844180	65	The Nutrition Physiology Corporation of Guymon , Okla. , sells a feed additive with lactobacillus , the same type of bacterium used in yogurt .
2007_05_01_1844180	66	The additive is sold to aid cattle digestion , but some studies suggest that it also reduces O157 in manure .
2007_05_01_1844180	67	An experimental approach is to feed cows sodium chlorate , a chemical used in the pulp and paper industry .
2007_05_01_1844180	68	This idea takes advantage of the fact that O157 has an enzyme that allows it to survive without oxygen , which is not true for most desirable bacteria .
2007_05_01_1844180	69	That enzyme will convert sodium chlorate to sodium chlorite , which poisons the pathogen . ''
2007_05_01_1844180	70	It 's like a suicide pill to the E. coli , '' said Robin C. Anderson , a microbiologist for the Agriculture Department in College Station , Tex. .
2007_05_01_1844180	71	Dr. Anderson said the treatment did not harm the cow .
2007_05_01_1844180	72	Eka Chemicals , which makes sodium chlorate for the paper industry , is working to obtain regulatory approval for a cattle treatment .
2007_05_01_1844180	73	The antibiotic neomycin has also been shown to reduce O157 levels in manure .
2007_05_01_1844180	74	Using antibiotics in animals raises concerns of spurring development of human pathogens resistant to the medicines .
2007_05_01_1844180	75	Another approach being studied involves phages , viruses that infect and kill bacteria .
2007_05_01_1844180	76	Experts say multiple approaches might be used in parallel , because no single approach works perfectly .
2007_05_01_1844180	77	Michael T. Osterholm , director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota , said he was skeptical about all the approaches . ''
2007_05_01_1844180	78	What really is a concern to me about this issue is we always have a tendency to want high-tech responses to what in many cases are common-sense low-tech solutions , '' Dr. Osterholm said .
2007_05_01_1844180	79	He is a consultant to Fresh Express , the leading seller of bagged salads , and is head of a committee that will disburse $ 2 million from the company for research on how the produce industry should handle E. coli .
2007_05_01_1844180	80	He said stringent safety procedures had kept that company from having any contamination incidents .
2007_05_01_1844180	81	In any case , even if a high-tech solution was desired , there does not seem to be a vaccine for spinach as there is for cattle .
2007_05_01_1844180	82	Greens are now often rinsed in chlorine solution , but that is not always effective because surface nooks and crannies can shelter the bacteria , said James Gorney , senior vice president for food safety and technology at the United Fresh Produce Association , a trade group .
2007_05_01_1844180	83	A possible alternative is to use a gas like chlorine dioxide instead of a liquid wash , Dr. Gorney said .
2007_05_01_1844180	84	Irradiation can also kill the bacteria .
2007_05_01_1844180	85	But he said the amount of radiation needed could damage fruits or vegetables .
2007_05_01_1844180	86	And some consumers object to the technique . ''
2007_05_01_1844180	87	Any one of these technologies does n't offer us a pasteurization step , '' Dr. Gorney said . ''
2007_05_01_1844180	88	So we are left with prevention , prevention and prevention , preventing the contamination from ever occurring . ''
2007_05_01_1844181	0	Sleeping on the job is not generally a good idea , but when it comes to the brain it may be another matter .
2007_05_01_1844181	1	As people sleep , a new study suggests , their brains may be sorting through the information they have gathered , making connections that could lead to new insights .
2007_05_01_1844181	2	The study appears online in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
2007_05_01_1844181	3	Earlier studies found that people appear better able to remember things they have just learned if they are able to sleep soon after .
2007_05_01_1844181	4	In effect , they found , the brain appears to use sleep time to consolidate memories .
2007_05_01_1844181	5	This study suggests that the process is still more complex , and that sleep helps people make inferences from bits of knowledge that may at first appear random , said one of the authors , Dr. Jeffrey M. Ellenbogen of Brigham and Women 's Hospital , the Harvard affiliate .
2007_05_01_1844181	6	People make minor inferences all the time without sleeping first , of course , but those connections tend to be fairly straightforward .
2007_05_01_1844181	7	Sleep appears to play a role in helping people make '' big picture '' realizations , Dr. Ellenbogen said , like those involved in major scientific breakthroughs . ''
2007_05_01_1844181	8	Inferences are abundant in the world , '' he wrote in an e-mail message . ''
2007_05_01_1844181	9	Only a few are obvious .
2007_05_01_1844181	10	The rest need time and sleep to discover them . ''
2007_05_01_1844181	11	For the study , researchers asked 56 college students to study pairs of elaborately decorated ovals .
2007_05_01_1844181	12	They were told that in each pair , one oval won out over the other .
2007_05_01_1844181	13	But they were not told of a broader pattern in which all the ovals were part of a hierarchy .
2007_05_01_1844181	14	The students were then broken into three groups .
2007_05_01_1844181	15	The members of one group were tested to see how much of the hierarchy they could discern just 20 minutes after they studied the shapes .
2007_05_01_1844181	16	Another group was tested 12 hours later , with half its members having slept .
2007_05_01_1844181	17	Members of the third group were tested 24 hours later , after all had slept .
2007_05_01_1844181	18	The first group did the worst , while those students who had been able to sleep did best .
2007_05_01_1844181	19	VITAL SIGNS : MENTAL ABILITIES
2007_05_01_1844182	0	Too little vitamin D is a common problem among elderly people that may help bring on medical conditions that cause weakness and disability .
2007_05_01_1844182	1	Now a new study suggests that a shortage of vitamin D may play a direct role in poor physical performance among the elderly .
2007_05_01_1844182	2	Writing in the April issue of The Journal of Gerontology : Medical Sciences , researchers said that people with low levels of vitamin D did worse on tests involving physical skills .
2007_05_01_1844182	3	The researchers , led by Denise K. Houston of Wake Forest University , drew on data from an Italian study in which more than 900 people 65 and older were tested for vitamin D levels and asked to perform several tasks .
2007_05_01_1844182	4	The researchers looked at how fast they walked , how quickly they could get out of a chair and how well they could balance .
2007_05_01_1844182	5	By some estimates , about a quarter of elderly people do not get enough vitamin D .
2007_05_01_1844182	6	But it is not purely a matter of diet , the researchers said , because much of the body 's vitamin D comes from exposure to sunlight .
2007_05_01_1844182	7	Older people may be less likely to be in the sun , said the researchers , who also pointed out that skin produces vitamin D less well as it ages .
2007_05_01_1844182	8	Even so , the study noted , research has found that older people who take vitamin D supplements have appeared to gain strength .
2007_05_01_1844183	0	If lowering sodium intake reduces the risk of high blood pressure , and high blood pressure can lead to heart disease , does eating less salt improve the health of one 's heart ?
2007_05_01_1844183	1	It seems obvious that it would , but in a new study , researchers offer what they say is some of the first good evidence that it really does .
2007_05_01_1844183	2	The study , which appears online in The British Medical Journal , looked at two groups of people more than a decade after they were asked to reduce their salt intake for up to 48 months .
2007_05_01_1844183	3	There were more than 3,000 participants , 30 to 54 , all of whom had a condition that put them at special risk for high blood pressure .
2007_05_01_1844183	4	The researchers , led by Nancy R. Cook of Brigham and Women 's Hospital , found that those who had significantly reduced their salt intake had a 25 percent lower risk of developing cardiovascular disease .
2007_05_01_1844183	5	Their risk of death from the disease was also cut , by as much as a fifth .
2007_05_01_1844183	6	Earlier studies have found that less salt in a diet is associated with lower blood pressure , but the researchers said it had been harder to establish what that meant for heart disease .
2007_05_01_1844183	7	The study pointed to other research showing that a lot of salt in the diet can cause cardiovascular problems on its own , apart from its role in high blood pressure . ''
2007_05_01_1844183	8	Our study , '' they said , '' provides unique evidence that sodium reduction might prevent cardiovascular disease and should dispel any residual concern that sodium reduction might be harmful . ''
2007_05_01_1844184	0	Some studies have found that people who suffer from migraines do not seem to lose any of their thinking skills as a result of the headaches .
2007_05_01_1844184	1	Other studies have found that they do .
2007_05_01_1844184	2	In either case , a new study has found that women who have migraines experience less cognitive decline than women who do not .
2007_05_01_1844184	3	Writing in the current issue of Neurology , the researchers said it was not clear why these women tested better on skills like memory .
2007_05_01_1844184	4	The research was led by Amanda Kalaydjian , now with the National Institute of Mental Health , when she was a doctoral student at Johns Hopkins .
2007_05_01_1844184	5	One explanation , they said , is that the drugs commonly taken for migraines may also ward off the cognitive declines that come with aging .
2007_05_01_1844184	6	But the study called this unlikely . ''
2007_05_01_1844184	7	Another factor that needs to be explored further , '' the authors write , '' is the possibility that migraineurs may change their diet or behavior in some way that might improve cognition . ''
2007_05_01_1844184	8	This includes getting more sleep and avoiding some types of food .
2007_05_01_1844184	9	Still , the authors said they could not rule out an explanation seemingly at odds with traditional thinking about migraines , which has it that repeated migraines may hurt brain function by injuring blood flow .
2007_05_01_1844184	10	It may instead be that underlying biological changes associated with migraines may actually reduce cognitive decline .
2007_05_01_1844184	11	The study looked at more than 1,400 women , about 20 of whom had migraines , over a 12-year period .
2007_05_01_1844184	12	VITAL SIGNS : PATTERNS Correction : May 23 , 2007 , Wednesday A brief article in Science Times on May 1 about research on migraines and mental decline referred incorrectly to the subjects of the study .
2007_05_01_1844184	13	The researchers looked at men and women , not just women .
2007_05_01_1844184	14	In addition , among the approximately 1,400 subjects studied over 12 years , more than 200 of them had a history of migraines -- not about 20 of them .
2007_05_01_1844185	0	Clouds were moving across the sun and a 20-knot northeast wind was stirring a 3-foot chop as Meaghan Johnson headed her open boat into the Florida Straits .
2007_05_01_1844185	1	Ms. Johnson , a program coordinator for the Nature Conservancy , headed the boat into the swells , to minimize swamping , as her passengers tried in vain to avoid soaking spray .
2007_05_01_1844185	2	One of them , Ken Nedimyer , stood next to her at the console , gazing out at the seemingly featureless welter of waves , seeking signs -- a slight change in water depth here , a barely visible underwater patch of reef there -- that only he could recognize and triangulate with the rapidly disappearing onshore landmarks of Key Largo .
2007_05_01_1844185	3	About two and a half miles out , he told Ms. Johnson to throttle back a bit . ''
2007_05_01_1844185	4	Over there , '' he said , pointing off the starboard bow . ''
2007_05_01_1844185	5	About 400 yards . ''
2007_05_01_1844185	6	The boat pulled up to the site and Philip Kramer , who directs the conservancy 's Caribbean Marine Program , set its anchor .
2007_05_01_1844185	7	Soon he , Ms. Johnson and Mr. Nedimyer were over the side , peering into the water through their snorkeling masks .
2007_05_01_1844185	8	Below them was what they had come to see , an array of concrete disks set in the sand .
2007_05_01_1844185	9	Each one held a tiny piece of coral .
2007_05_01_1844185	10	Mr. Nedimyer had led them to a nursery , one of a number he has established since 2000 , when chance , coincidence , a government program and a lifelong passion for tropical fish set him on an adventure : a quest to nourish and restore the tattered remains of the Keys ' once glorious reefs .
2007_05_01_1844185	11	He is working with assistance from the conservancy , which in turn cooperates with the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary and the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration , which has its own coral efforts in places like Puerto Rico .
2007_05_01_1844185	12	Meanwhile , the Environmental Protection Agency is looking at water quality standards for corals in Florida , Hawaii , the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico , the only American territories where they occur .
2007_05_01_1844185	13	The Coral Reef Task Force , created in the Clinton administration , regularly assesses coral health .
2007_05_01_1844185	14	The World Bank , motivated in large part by corals ' importance for ecosystems and ecotourism , has embarked on a global program to assess restoration efforts and to identify tactics to combat their decline .
2007_05_01_1844185	15	And 90 miles south on Highway 1 , the traffic-snarled spine of the Keys , biologists at the Mote Marine Laboratory struggle with their own coral nursery efforts .
2007_05_01_1844185	16	Like Mr. Nedimyer , they are trying to identify strains of coral that grow well in the Keys , and to re-establish them offshore .
2007_05_01_1844185	17	Theirs is an uphill battle .
2007_05_01_1844185	18	Many would say corals globally are already so damaged , and so threatened by further environmental degradation , that there is little chance restoration efforts can turn things around .
2007_05_01_1844185	19	Staghorn and elkhorn corals , Mr. Nedimyer 's principal interests , were once abundant in South Florida , the Bahamas and elsewhere in the Caribbean .
2007_05_01_1844185	20	But since the 1990s they have significantly declined , to the point that last year they were placed on the threatened list , under the Endangered Species Act .
2007_05_01_1844185	21	They are suffering the kinds of environmental disruption that afflict corals around the world . ''
2007_05_01_1844185	22	We have lost 25 percent of the world 's corals in the last 25 years , '' David E. Vaughan , director of the Center for Coral Reef Research at Mote , said in an interview , adding that 25 percent more are expected to die in the next decade or two . ''
2007_05_01_1844185	23	Sometimes we sound like doomsday sayers , '' Dr. Vaughan said , '' but those are the facts . ''
2007_05_01_1844185	24	Environmental disruption takes many forms .
2007_05_01_1844185	25	Fishing boats , and even dive boats and divers , can damage reefs .
2007_05_01_1844185	26	Sea turtles bang into corals , breaking them .
2007_05_01_1844185	27	Polluted runoff can deprive corals of the clear , oxygen-rich water they need to survive .
2007_05_01_1844185	28	And then there is global warming .
2007_05_01_1844185	29	So far , scientists say , it has had two main effects on coral , both potentially lethal .
2007_05_01_1844185	30	First , as oceans absorb more carbon dioxide , the chief greenhouse gas , they become more acidic .
2007_05_01_1844185	31	The acidity makes it more difficult for corals to grow and may even cause them to start to dissolve .
2007_05_01_1844185	32	And as oceans warm , algae that live in corals , and on which they depend , may be killed .
2007_05_01_1844185	33	David Lackland , a biologist at Mote , tells children who visit that corals live with algae as people might live if they liked asparagus , say , but instead of raising it in gardens they grew it inside their bodies , absorbing it directly as energy and fertilizing it with their waste in a symbiotic relationship .
2007_05_01_1844185	34	Different kinds of corals have different kinds of algae symbionts , but if the algae are threatened , corals are threatened , too .
2007_05_01_1844185	35	Another serious disruption is overfishing .
2007_05_01_1844185	36	Corals need herbivorous fish to keep unwanted algae under control .
2007_05_01_1844185	37	When seaweed-eating fish are gone , '' you are going to end up with seaweed blooms , '' said Nancy Knowlton , director of the Center for Marine Biodiversity and Conservation at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and a leader in the World Bank effort . ''
2007_05_01_1844185	38	It 's been shown that seaweeds release a lot of sugars into the water , '' she said .
2007_05_01_1844185	39	Because many bacteria need sugars , '' you have these bacteria blooms that kill corals . ''
2007_05_01_1844185	40	Corals also need predators like groupers , snappers , barracudas and even lobsters to prevent the proliferation of coral-eating snails , worms and other organisms .
2007_05_01_1844185	41	Meanwhile , a host of diseases plague coral , many of them poorly understood .
2007_05_01_1844185	42	For example , staghorn and elkhorn coral are vulnerable to so-called white-band disease , in which coral tissue mysteriously decays .
2007_05_01_1844185	43	The disease , which struck the Caribbean in the mid-1990s , kills healthy tissue , leaving only white skeletons .
2007_05_01_1844185	44	It usually progresses quickly , and while it almost never wipes out complete colonies , colonies can be reinfected .
2007_05_01_1844185	45	Scientists do not know for sure what causes the condition , and their suspects -- bacteria , fungi and other microbes -- are present at healthy corals as well as sickly formations , adding to the mystery .
2007_05_01_1844185	46	Corals in South Florida have another big problem , a die-off of sea urchins , which began succumbing wholesale to a mysterious ailment about 20 years ago .
2007_05_01_1844185	47	Urchins graze on unwanted algae , and without them , corals in many areas have been smothered in overgrowth , making it difficult or impossible for them to grow or propagate .
2007_05_01_1844185	48	Mr. Nedimyer focuses most of his efforts on coral , something he got into almost by accident several years ago , through his work as a wholesale dealer in aquarium supplies , a business he has operated for 35 years .
2007_05_01_1844185	49	One of his products is '' live rock , '' reef rubble that bacteria colonize .
2007_05_01_1844185	50	In aquariums , the bacteria help break down waste from fish .
2007_05_01_1844185	51	He had permission from the government to gather live rock at a particular site and one day about 10 years ago , he noticed that a few bits of rubble had something growing on them . ''
2007_05_01_1844185	52	I did n't know what it was at first , '' he said . ''
2007_05_01_1844185	53	I saw five of these little things .
2007_05_01_1844185	54	I kept watching them and pretty soon they started to grow out into staghorn coral . ''
2007_05_01_1844185	55	He set the rocks aside , underwater , and managed to keep the coral growing in spite of storms and other problems .
2007_05_01_1844185	56	When he found broken pieces of coral he stuck them in other pieces of rock , and '' sometimes they would live . ''
2007_05_01_1844185	57	In 2000 , at an aquarium in Orlando , he heard a presentation on Pacific coral and learned that '' you can cut these things into tiny fragments and glue them to things and they will grow . ''
2007_05_01_1844185	58	Back in the Keys , he started experimenting .
2007_05_01_1844185	59	His daughter Kelly helped , turning the work into a 4-H project .
2007_05_01_1844185	60	At first it was trial and error .
2007_05_01_1844185	61	They experimented with growing platforms and especially with how to glue coral fragments to them . ''
2007_05_01_1844185	62	We tried a lot of epoxy , '' Mr. Nedimyer said . ''
2007_05_01_1844185	63	We found kinds that stick to wetsuits , tohair , to cameras . ''
2007_05_01_1844185	64	Eventually , they discovered a two-part epoxy glue used in taxidermy .
2007_05_01_1844185	65	They can mix it on a boat and it remains workable for about half an hour .
2007_05_01_1844185	66	And it is white , which looks nice against the sandy bottom .
2007_05_01_1844185	67	For a brief heady moment , he recalled , he thought about the fact that he has government permission to sell coral and considered turning it into a lucrative sideline for his business .
2007_05_01_1844185	68	But then , he said , he started thinking about what had happened to the Keys ' reefs since he first encountered them in the 1970s , '' when there would be thickets three , four , five feet high and just vast . ''
2007_05_01_1844185	69	Those kinds of underwater landscapes have just about vanished , he said . ''
2007_05_01_1844185	70	So I thought , well , these corals are in trouble .
2007_05_01_1844185	71	And we can make a difference rather than make money . ''
2007_05_01_1844185	72	Today he has several nurseries , each with a variety of coral strains , at varying depth , water quality and distance from shore .
2007_05_01_1844185	73	The goal of the project is to identify which coral strains are most robust and in what conditions .
2007_05_01_1844185	74	Dr. Kramer , Ms. Johnson and Mr. Nedimyer were pleased by the corals they saw at the nursery .
2007_05_01_1844185	75	After climbing back into the boat , Mr. Nedimyer said : '' They were a few inches , now they are two or three times the size .
2007_05_01_1844185	76	That 's a lot of growth in six months . ''
2007_05_01_1844185	77	Dr. Knowlton , the coral expert at Scripps , said staghorn coral was among the fastest growing -- up to four inches or so from branch tips in a year , whereas most corals grow only about half an inch a year .
2007_05_01_1844185	78	But , she said , corals that grow quickly are often unusually sensitive to their environment . ''
2007_05_01_1844185	79	They can slip from growing really fast to dying really fast , '' she said .
2007_05_01_1844185	80	At Mote , Mr. Lackland maintains and propagates a variety of coral species in tanks , and hopes to emulate Mr. Nedimyer with offshore nurseries between Looe Key and American Shoals .
2007_05_01_1844185	81	Like Mr. Nedimyer , Mr. Lackland , who is 40 , parlayed a youthful fascination with marine creatures -- he had corals in tanks in his bedroom as a teenager in Watchung , N.J. -- into his life 's work .
2007_05_01_1844185	82	After earning a bachelor 's degree in biology , he worked at an aquarium in Point Pleasant Beach , N.J. , where his one-bedroom apartment had six tank systems filled with coral .
2007_05_01_1844185	83	Friends told him he had '' a blue thumb . ''
2007_05_01_1844185	84	Eventually , he said , he decided to go to the Florida Keys , '' where they have the most hurting ocean , an ocean that 's slipping away as far as its coral cover . ''
2007_05_01_1844185	85	He presented himself at the National Marine Sanctuary , where he learned there might be an opening for a biologist at Mote .
2007_05_01_1844185	86	When he got the job , '' I was thrilled , '' he said .
2007_05_01_1844185	87	Today , he presides over several rooms full of tanks where many species of coral grow on networks of iron pipes .
2007_05_01_1844185	88	Mr. Lackland has devised elaborate systems to mimic the flow of ocean currents , the varying pressure of waves and even the coming and going of daylight .
2007_05_01_1844185	89	He feeds his coral oyster larvae and other plankton , which he buys from an aquarium supplier , and he has devised formulas to maintain the proper mineral balance in the water .
2007_05_01_1844185	90	Some of his corals are doing so well they have even spawned in the tanks .
2007_05_01_1844185	91	Like Mr. Nedimyer , he is starting corals on concrete disks and establishing them in the water , in his case between Looe Key and American Shoals , near the laboratory .
2007_05_01_1844185	92	Dr. Kramer noted that , over all , '' corals have managed to deal with many swift changes in the last million and half years . ''
2007_05_01_1844185	93	He added , '' Over these geological time scales , in the long term , corals may be able to handle these climate changes . ''
2007_05_01_1844185	94	Meanwhile , though , he said , '' I think these types of strategies have a real role to play . ''
2007_05_01_1844185	95	For scientists like Dr. Knowlton , the major question is not whether some coral strains might do better than others .
2007_05_01_1844185	96	That is almost a given , she said . ''
2007_05_01_1844185	97	The biggest problem is making a difference on a regional scale or even on a large local scale . ''
2007_05_01_1844185	98	She said people interested in corals should focus on '' fixing the things we can fix -- climate action or water quality action or stopping overfishing . ''
2007_05_01_1844185	99	In interviews , Mr. Lackland and Mr. Nedimyer separately acknowledged that viewed from any reasonable perspective , the problem is huge and their efforts are small . ''
2007_05_01_1844185	100	I am not an ostrich , '' Mr. Lackland said . ''
2007_05_01_1844185	101	The facts are really bad . ''
2007_05_01_1844185	102	But , he added , '' If the ocean is really in that bad condition , let 's gear up ! ''
2007_05_01_1844185	103	Mr. Nedimyer shares this view even though , as he put it , every day he spends on the project '' is one day I ca n't make a living . ''
2007_05_01_1844185	104	But one of its major rewards , he said , was its lesson for his daughter Kelly , now 19 and a student at the University of Central Florida , and the Coral Shores students working with him . ''
2007_05_01_1844185	105	We have turned five corals into five to seven hundred , '' he said . ''
2007_05_01_1844185	106	In another year or two we 'll have several thousand corals .
2007_05_01_1844185	107	That 's mostly one person making a difference . ''
2007_05_01_1844185	108	Correction : May 7 , 2007 , Monday An article and picture caption in Science Times on Tuesday about efforts to re-establish coral reefs referred incorrectly to the networks of pipes on which coral is grown in the Mote Marine Laboratory in Florida .
2007_05_01_1844185	109	The pipes are made of PVC , not iron .
2007_05_01_1844185	110	The article also carried an incomplete list of American territories where corals occur .
2007_05_01_1844185	111	Besides Florida , Hawaii , the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico , corals also grow in warm and cold water in several other areas , including American Samoa and the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Louisiana and Texas .
2007_05_01_1844186	0	'' He was sort of a different type of a person , '' ventures Betty Gossell , who went to high school with Marlon Brando in Illinois .
2007_05_01_1844186	1	A different type of person .
2007_05_01_1844186	2	That may be the last word on Brando , who died in 2004 .
2007_05_01_1844186	3	No significantly more penetrating insight is offered into Brando 's character by Al Pacino , Robert Duvall , Johnny Depp , John Travolta and Jane Fonda in '' Brando , '' a two-part documentary about this big man that begins tonight on Turner Classic Movies .
2007_05_01_1844186	4	But their hymns to him are poignant and worth hearing .
2007_05_01_1844186	5	As the documentary makes clear , hitting its points with style , Marlon Brando was n't like other movie stars .
2007_05_01_1844186	6	He was n't like other serious actors .
2007_05_01_1844186	7	He was n't like other rebels .
2007_05_01_1844186	8	He was n't like other ladies ' men .
2007_05_01_1844186	9	He was different . ''
2007_05_01_1844186	10	He drummed on everything too , '' says Janet Aemisegger , a white-haired woman who said she used to sit in front of Brando in algebra class .
2007_05_01_1844186	11	The image piques interest .
2007_05_01_1844186	12	Brando was one of those chronically drumming kids .
2007_05_01_1844186	13	What do you know ?
2007_05_01_1844186	14	In a 1955 interview with Ed Sullivan , young Brando in suit and skinny tie talks of his love of rhythm , recalling the pulsation of the donkey engine for the water pump on his family 's farm .
2007_05_01_1844186	15	With a half-smile , he even breaks into a jazzy whispery impression of the engine .
2007_05_01_1844186	16	At that fwuhhh he gets you all over again , from the grave this time , devilish and freakish and heartbreaking , even when we know how it ends : with Brando in Colonel Kurtz mode , obese , portentous , self-infatuated , preening .
2007_05_01_1844186	17	That too seems gorgeous , come to think of it .
2007_05_01_1844186	18	Brando fans may watch this program , as we watch the Brando movies or read the Brando books , in hopes of deciding the question of whether the big man was mostly a genius or mostly a fat fool .
2007_05_01_1844186	19	A decisive clue is not here .
2007_05_01_1844186	20	As image after beautiful image appears , the clearest conclusion is that we are the fools , for falling for him , like Stella , like that sulky Frenchwoman in '' Last Tango in Paris . ''
2007_05_01_1844186	21	Or , for that matter , like Tarita Teriipaia , Brando 's former wife , who published a memoir in 2004 called , '' Marlon , My Love , My Suffering . ''
2007_05_01_1844186	22	So first comes review .
2007_05_01_1844186	23	Brando 's father was mean , and his mother was drunk .
2007_05_01_1844186	24	Ms. Fonda , in a garish cowboy hat that suggests her interview was taped during her fad years , complicates the picture of Brando 's boozing mother somewhat by reminding viewers that Dorothy Brando gave her father , Henry Fonda , his start as an actor .
2007_05_01_1844186	25	It seems she recruited him for a community play in Omaha .
2007_05_01_1844186	26	Brando 's father was a traveling salesman with girlfriends .
2007_05_01_1844186	27	He was cruel at home , but seldom there .
2007_05_01_1844186	28	Brando was sent to military school , where he acted , played football and hurt his knee .
2007_05_01_1844186	29	The injury exempted him from the World War II draft , and he moved to New York .
2007_05_01_1844186	30	At this cue '' Brando '' cuts to stock film of city girls in spackled makeup batting eyes at the camera .
2007_05_01_1844186	31	This is what Brando is believed to have found in Times Square .
2007_05_01_1844186	32	As the film chronicles Brando 's career , fellow actors give head-shaking descriptions of his so-called mumbly-stumbly acting style .
2007_05_01_1844186	33	Broadway actors of the '40s were still accustomed to crisp presentationalism , while Brando , freshly anointed by the Method grande dame Stella Adler , would talk into his sweater , murmur and upstage himself , seeming to subvert the very purpose of performance .
2007_05_01_1844186	34	Later accounts of his hackwork ( '' Candy , '' anyone ? )
2007_05_01_1844186	35	, when he was acting to support his life in Tahiti or his forays into politics , are entertaining .
2007_05_01_1844186	36	Supremely bratty about his talents and lazy about memorizing dialogue , he only supplied directors with glimpses of what they were paying for .
2007_05_01_1844186	37	And then came '' The Godfather , '' and the part for which Mr. Pacino convincingly says he first proposed Brando , whose career was on the skids by then .
2007_05_01_1844186	38	James Caan and Robert Duvall reminisce like schoolboys about their hero .
2007_05_01_1844186	39	Then came '' Last Tango , '' and the butter .
2007_05_01_1844186	40	Brando was back , and , as Martin Scorsese says , he was also done .
2007_05_01_1844186	41	Everyone on film here , including Laurence Olivier and Quincy Jones , including the people Brando relentlessly hazed and wrong-footed , indulges in Brando worship .
2007_05_01_1844186	42	( A surprising moment : Olivier 's undated insistence that Brando is a better actor than he is . )
2007_05_01_1844186	43	This film could use a skeptic , though it 's eventually to be commended for refraining from bashing Brando too hard for his obvious personal failings .
2007_05_01_1844186	44	In the end there 's something direct , simple and thorough about '' Brando . ''
2007_05_01_1844186	45	With the leading man gone , the film seems to come with remarkably little baggage and few strings .
2007_05_01_1844186	46	The same probably can not be said about any production involving Brando when he lived .
2007_05_01_1844189	0	The Los Angeles Philharmonic is an exciting orchestra .
2007_05_01_1844189	1	First , it 's exciting for superficial reasons : it plays in a hot new hall designed by Frank Gehry , and it has just announced its impending transition from one crack former wunderkind conductor , Esa-Pekka Salonen , to another , Gustavo Dudamel , in 2009 .
2007_05_01_1844189	2	But it 's also exciting because of the sound it makes , big and compelling , under Mr. Salonen , who , still boyish and very much in command , showed off the ensemble he has helped to shape on Sunday afternoon at Avery Fisher Hall .
2007_05_01_1844189	3	The concert opened by unleashing all of the orchestra 's and Mr. Salonen 's strengths , exhilaratingly , upon the audience with Mr. Salonen 's own piece '' Helix . ''
2007_05_01_1844189	4	Mr. Salonen plans to compose full time when he leaves the orchestra , and he is certainly developing happily as a composer ; into an oeuvre that has always been smart and sometimes thorny are creeping elements of ease , fluidity and fun . ''
2007_05_01_1844189	5	Helix '' is an exuberant showpiece , on a much smaller scale than the piano concerto he wrote that the New York Philharmonic played in February .
2007_05_01_1844189	6	Its gimmick is that the tempo markings steadily increase throughout , adding propulsive force to a work that , thick with detail , throws out sounds and ideas as it builds steam .
2007_05_01_1844189	7	Mr. Salonen clearly enjoys immersing himself in an orchestra 's sound and playing with the many things it can do , as a composer as well as a conductor .
2007_05_01_1844189	8	This orchestra 's big sound , however , is not to be confused with opulence : energy , not sensuality , was the afternoon 's hallmark .
2007_05_01_1844189	9	With a swirling opening not unlike that of '' La Valse '' and a roaring close like a crashing wave , '' Helix '' was well paired with Ravel 's Piano Concerto for the Left Hand .
2007_05_01_1844189	10	But Jean-Yves Thibaudet , the soloist , and Mr. Salonen seemed more a case of opposites attracting .
2007_05_01_1844189	11	Mr. Thibaudet 's strongest moments came in passages of quiet tenderness ; in the loud opening , his playing sounded muddy .
2007_05_01_1844189	12	Mr. Salonen and the orchestra , by contrast , maintained their lithe athleticism ; their entrances after Mr. Thibaudet 's cadenzas felt like the introduction of another idea in a dialogue rather than like the seamless continuation of a whole .
2007_05_01_1844189	13	As for tenderness , Mr. Salonen has not a drop of schmaltz in his body , and his orchestra 's strings have a taut and sometimes fuzzy muscularity rather than warmth .
2007_05_01_1844189	14	This rendered uneven the concluding and generally excellent suite from Prokofiev 's '' Romeo and Juliet . ''
2007_05_01_1844189	15	Parts were breathtaking : '' The Morning Dance '' drove the orchestra into a frenzy , and during '' The Death of Tybalt '' Mr. Salonen 's baton whiplashed a string of fierce white chords .
2007_05_01_1844189	16	But the young Juliet sounded like a dancer slightly past her prime , tendons standing out as she executed the moves of a young girl flawlessly , with a frozen smile .
2007_05_01_1844191	0	Already stripped of much of its travertine cladding , Alice Tully Hall has shut down for an 18-month makeover led by the architects Diller Scofidio & Renfro .
2007_05_01_1844191	1	The renovation , the first major phase of a redevelopment project at Lincoln Center , involves replacing much of the travertine with glass to foster a sense of communication between the interior and the street .
2007_05_01_1844191	2	In the new incarnation , a glass-enclosed dance rehearsal studio of the Juilliard School will be visible just above a soaring three-story Alice Tully lobby .

2007_05_01_1844192	0	Coal is so cheap and so widely available that its increased use is inevitable , but clearing the hurdle to burning it on a wide scale -- separating the carbon dioxide and sequestering it -- could turn out to be one of the great engineering challenges of the century , energy experts say .
2007_05_01_1844192	1	There are at least a dozen proposals on Capitol Hill for sequestering all the carbon from coal burning , and the Senate Energy Committee began hearings last month on how to refocus research on the problem .
2007_05_01_1844192	2	It 's a challenge that has captured the attention of engineers across the country who hope to perfect a clean-coal technology that could provide climate-friendly energy for hundreds of years at modest cost . ''
2007_05_01_1844192	3	Coal has to be in our energy mix , because of its value for society and its importance to the country , '' said Mark Gray , vice president for engineering services at American Electric Power , which recently announced three projects to capture carbon . ''
2007_05_01_1844192	4	We have enough coal for anywhere from 200 to 450 years . ''
2007_05_01_1844192	5	One of the first proposals likely to get a serious airing in Washington is a bill introduced by Senator Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico , the chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee , and Senator Pete V. Domenici , also of New Mexico , who is the committee 's ranking Republican .
2007_05_01_1844192	6	They were joined in late March by five other senators in submitting the proposal , which aims to improve the Energy Department 's ability to sponsor research in carbon capture and sequestration .
2007_05_01_1844192	7	Engineers are working on methods for capturing the carbon emitted when coal is burned .
2007_05_01_1844192	8	They have considered options as diverse as freezing the gases as they come out of smokestacks , and binding them to a liquid chemical after combustion .
2007_05_01_1844192	9	Two other possibilities are to modify the coal before it is burned , or to change the air it is burned with .
2007_05_01_1844192	10	Capturing the gas , though , is just one part of the equation .
2007_05_01_1844192	11	Finding a way to store it is likely to prove equally challenging .
2007_05_01_1844192	12	The leading possibility is old oil fields , where the carbon dioxide could be injected to force more oil to existing wells .
2007_05_01_1844192	13	But the total capacity of all the old oil fields in the world is much too small for this purpose .
2007_05_01_1844192	14	In addition , the oil fields are punctured by wells that could provide escape routes for the carbon dioxide to leak into .
2007_05_01_1844192	15	Work has also focused on getting a pure stream of carbon dioxide .
2007_05_01_1844192	16	That is a challenge because flue gases from a coal plant are only about 12 percent carbon dioxide , by weight .
2007_05_01_1844192	17	The mix is mostly nitrogen , since nitrogen makes up 78 percent of the air consumed during combustion .
2007_05_01_1844192	18	The energy agency is focused on a generating technology called Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle , or I.G.C.C. .
2007_05_01_1844192	19	This technology uses generating stations to burn gas in a turbine , which powers a rotating shaft connected to a generator .
2007_05_01_1844192	20	Then the exhaust gases are used to boil water , which makes steam to turn a second turbine , to make more electricity .
2007_05_01_1844192	21	In the coal variant , the gas is created by cooking the coal , in a low-oxygen environment , into a gaseous mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen .
2007_05_01_1844192	22	Two such plants are operating in the United States and more are planned , but they do not separate their carbon .
2007_05_01_1844192	23	The Energy Department has a program for building I.G.C.C. plants that would separate their carbon .
2007_05_01_1844192	24	Under the program , called FutureGen , new I.G.C.C. plants would make the same gas from coal , but the carbon monoxide would react with steam to make carbon dioxide and more hydrogen .
2007_05_01_1844192	25	The hydrogen would go to the turbine , leaving the carbon dioxide to be sequestered .
2007_05_01_1844192	26	The agency 's push toward finding places to build those plants and partners to do the work may not be moving as fast as the political momentum to limit carbon emissions , and FutureGen has won a nickname -- NeverGen -- from the utility executives who are wary of such partnerships .
2007_05_01_1844192	27	In addition , the technology can not be retrofitted on traditional plants , called pulverized coal plants , and may even be hard to apply to existing I.G.C.C. plants that were not designed for capture .
2007_05_01_1844192	28	The private sector is chasing two other possible routes .
2007_05_01_1844192	29	One got a boost recently from American Electric Power , a coal-based utility that often sets technological trends .
2007_05_01_1844192	30	American Electric , with Babcock & Wilcox , is testing a technology to feed the boiler with oxygen , not air , so that the flue gases are almost all carbon dioxide . ''
2007_05_01_1844192	31	You get a flame that mimics what you get with air , '' said Michael W. Rencheck , American Electric 's senior vice president for engineering projects .
2007_05_01_1844192	32	A key question , though , is whether the energy required to strip the nitrogen out of the air is more or less than the energy required in other systems .
2007_05_01_1844192	33	Mr. Rencheck 's company is trying out another technology , at the back end of the plant where the gases leave the furnace .
2007_05_01_1844192	34	American Electric 's plan is to inject ammonia chilled to 37 to 45 degrees into the gases leaving the boiler , and let it absorb the carbon dioxide , and then heat the ammonia to about 88 degrees so it gives the carbon dioxide back for sequestration .
2007_05_01_1844192	35	An electric industry coalition has been testing the idea in a laboratory , and a small-scale test is scheduled for later this year at a coal-fired plant in Wisconsin .
2007_05_01_1844192	36	If American Electric can make it work on a portion of the flue gasses at a plant in West Virginia next year , it will install the process on a full-scale basis at another plant , in Oklahoma , which would represent the first full-scale demonstration .
2007_05_01_1844193	0	Q. Is balding an indicator of more rapid aging and a shorter life span ?
2007_05_01_1844193	1	A. No evidence of a link between hair loss and premature death was found in a large and well-known Danish study published in 1998 in The Journals of Gerontology .
2007_05_01_1844193	2	Perhaps surprisingly , other signs of aging like wrinkles and gray hair were not linked to early deaths , either .
2007_05_01_1844193	3	The study , involving a random sample of 20,000 men and women in the Copenhagen City Heart Study , recorded the extent of baldness , gray hair , wrinkles and a ring around the cornea , called arcus senilis , that often occurs in old age .
2007_05_01_1844193	4	The group was followed for 16 years .
2007_05_01_1844193	5	The authors concluded : '' We found no correlation between the mortality and the extent of graying of the hair or baldness or facial wrinkles in either of the sexes , irrespective of age .
2007_05_01_1844193	6	A single exception was observed in a small subgroup of men with no gray hair . ''
2007_05_01_1844193	7	Those lucky men had a slightly lower mortality rate , but the difference was statistically significant .
2007_05_01_1844193	8	Arcus senilis was significantly correlated with a shorter life span in women .

2007_05_01_1844196	0	Oscar Wilde 's short story '' Lord Arthur Savile 's Crime '' is a clever mystery , written to indict the fate industry -- the palmists , spiritualists and telepathists , frauds every one of the them , with whom late-19th-century aristocrats seemed so enthralled .
2007_05_01_1844196	1	The writer Rob Urbinati has used the story , with its dramatic twists and turns , as a blueprint for his latest theatrical effort , '' West Moon Street . ''
2007_05_01_1844196	2	And while it might seem a bit like taking paprika to Hungary , to lighten up Oscar Wilde he has molded the story into a briskly paced comedy of manners true to its author 's greater spirit .
2007_05_01_1844196	3	A production of the Prospect Theater Company , '' West Moon Street '' is simply a delight .
2007_05_01_1844196	4	Mr. Urbinati and his director , Davis McCallum , see the allegorical potential in Wilde 's story . ''
2007_05_01_1844196	5	Lord Arthur Savile 's Crime '' is , in the end , a treatise on the fears that unravel us in the wake of marriage , the equations we make between domestic serenity and death .
2007_05_01_1844196	6	And '' West Moon Street '' has fun making all the connections .
2007_05_01_1844196	7	In the story , a young Oxford graduate , Lord Arthur , learns from a palm reader at a dinner party near the eve of his wedding that he will be complicit in a murder .
2007_05_01_1844196	8	Convinced that he must get this killing business out of the way before he marries , Lord Arthur postpones his wedding and sets about trying to determine who he will extinguish . ''
2007_05_01_1844196	9	He had lived the delicate and luxurious life of a young man of birth and fortune , a life exquisite in its freedom from sordid care , its beautiful boyish insouciance , '' Wilde writes of Arthur , processing the news . ''
2007_05_01_1844196	10	And now for the first time he became conscious of the terrible mystery of Destiny , of the awful meaning of Doom . ''
2007_05_01_1844196	11	David Ruffin does a sly , wonderful job mining Lord Arthur for all the boyish insouciance Wilde intended him to embody so that we see exactly what it is he 'll have to sacrifice .
2007_05_01_1844196	12	And Mr. Ruffin is surrounded by a cast of equally skilled comic performers , among them , Glenn Peters who plays , in drag , the doddering old aunt whom Lord Arthur sets out to eliminate , and Jocelyn Greene as a consummate drawing room flibbertigibbet -- grating giggle and all .

2007_05_01_1844200	0	Every so often at this year 's New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival over the weekend , musicians would announce that they were finally back in their old homes after being displaced for a more than a year by Hurricane Katrina .
2007_05_01_1844200	1	The queen of New Orleans soul , Irma Thomas , returned to her house two weeks ago ; Jean Knight , who had the hit '' Mr. Big Stuff , '' said she was back ; and Brice Miller , the trumpeter for the Mahogany Brass Band , announced on Saturday that he had just spent his first night in his old bedroom .
2007_05_01_1844200	2	They 're the luckier ones .
2007_05_01_1844200	3	They did n't live in destroyed neighborhoods like the Lower Ninth Ward that are still virtually empty .
2007_05_01_1844200	4	And they can return to a livelihood : jobs at clubs in the more-touristed parts of New Orleans , which are back in business and ready to party .
2007_05_01_1844200	5	The culture of New Orleans -- the thoroughly local music , food and rituals that are connected to African processions , European carnivals , Caribbean rhythms and America 's history of slavery and intermingling -- is a draw not just for tourists , but for New Orleanians .
2007_05_01_1844200	6	Through sheer perseverance , it is being rebuilt .
2007_05_01_1844200	7	The 38th annual Jazzfest was its old celebratory self , with an undercurrent of determination .
2007_05_01_1844200	8	Jazzfest , which continues this coming weekend , has stoked the city 's culture by gathering it for the outside world to see since 1970 .
2007_05_01_1844200	9	More than 80 percent of this year 's performers are Louisiana musicians who cover a century of music , from brass bands to bayou zydeco to hip-hop .
2007_05_01_1844200	10	To hear the pianist Henry Butler splashing free-jazz dissonances and wild whoops and hollers into New Orleans standards like '' Tipitina , '' or to hear the Hot 8 Brass Band mixing old-fashioned oompah with Latin and hip-hop beats was to hear the continuity of a culture that faces its troubles with rhythm and flamboyance .
2007_05_01_1844200	11	Only in New Orleans would a band -- Bob French and the Original Tuxedo Jazz Band , to be exact -- put a traditional jazz beat under P-Funk 's chant , '' Tear the roof off the sucker . ''
2007_05_01_1844200	12	The locals shared the first weekend 's lineup with headliners like Norah Jones , Bonnie Raitt , T Bone Burnett , Jill Scott , Ludacris , Brad Paisley , Pharoah Sanders and the Mexican brass band Banda el Recodo .
2007_05_01_1844200	13	There were also performers who were born in Louisiana , including Lucinda Williams , Jerry Lee Lewis and Johnny Rivers , whose '' Secret Agent Man '' had a touch of bayou-country swamp-pop .
2007_05_01_1844200	14	The visitors did n't forget where they were .
2007_05_01_1844200	15	They performed with New Orleans musicians : Ms. Jones with Trombone Shorty , Mr. Sanders with the trumpeter Terence Blanchard , Ms. Raitt with half a dozen guests for a weekend-closing medley of New Orleans R & B. Songs were addressed to the city for both its losses and its survival .
2007_05_01_1844200	16	When Ms. Raitt sang her '' God Was in the Water , '' an eerie song written before Katrina , she dedicated it to the Ninth Ward , the rest of the city and '' all the people still waiting for the help they deserved . ''
2007_05_01_1844200	17	Ms. Williams choked up as she sang her mournful '' Everything Has Changed , '' and Mr. Burnett sang apocalyptic imagery to swampy blues-rock riffs .
2007_05_01_1844200	18	The zydeco and Cajun musicians from the bayou country to the west , which was harder hit by Hurricane Rita , also sang about the storms ; the Cajun rocker Zachary Richard had a song that vowed , '' Seven generations we 've been stuck here in the mud/But the only way that I 'm leaving Louisiana is if I 'm swept away in a flood . ''
2007_05_01_1844200	19	As often happens at Jazzfest , the locals -- not all of them able to return yet -- stole the show .
2007_05_01_1844200	20	On Sunday afternoon a set by the New Orleans Social Club defined the heart of the festival .
2007_05_01_1844200	21	With George Porter Jr. and Leo Nocentelli from the definitive New Orleans funk band , the Meters , along with Dr. John and Irma Thomas , the group was an all-star contingent of New Orleans musicians who had gathered in Austin six weeks after Katrina to record a benefit album .
2007_05_01_1844200	22	Their set reached back into New Orleans tradition , including the Mardi Gras Indian song '' Indian Red , '' which insists , '' We wo n't bow down , '' and it mingled anger and optimism .
2007_05_01_1844200	23	It also dug deep into the parade-beat rhythms that are at the roots of jazz and New Orleans R&B and funk .
2007_05_01_1844200	24	And it had a huge crowd dancing .
2007_05_01_1844200	25	Jazzfest has long since become a local ritual itself , one that became more important after the hurricane made clear that New Orleans could not be taken for granted .
2007_05_01_1844200	26	The festival is a nonprofit event , and its Jazz and Heritage Foundation owns the license to the gloriously New Orleans-centric radio station WWOZ-FM .
2007_05_01_1844200	27	It also supports , quietly and pragmatically , the street processions that maintain New Orleans rhythms and communities .
2007_05_01_1844200	28	In recent years the foundation has paid for police permits for second-line parades , which send brass bands and fancy-suited Social Aid and Pleasure Clubs strutting through the streets .
2007_05_01_1844200	29	The foundation has also started to buy plumes -- pricey ostrich feathers -- for the Mardi Gras Indians who spend a year sewing the outsize suits that they flaunt from Mardi Gras season in February through Jazzfest in May .
2007_05_01_1844200	30	Social Aid and Pleasure Clubs and Mardi Gras Indian gangs arose in the city 's poorer neighborhoods -- including some that are still depopulated -- but they are tenacious .
2007_05_01_1844200	31	Last year the foundation bought plumes for 80 Indians ; this year for 188 .
2007_05_01_1844200	32	Among the Mardi Gras Indians parading at Jazzfest were the Ninth Ward Hunters .
2007_05_01_1844200	33	One of Jazzfest 's staples is its gospel tent , where local church choirs and touring gospel groups perform all day .
2007_05_01_1844200	34	The hurricane gave them another reason to praise the Lord : making it through . ''
2007_05_01_1844200	35	You hurt me , Katrina , but I 'm still standing ! ''
2007_05_01_1844200	36	preached Bishop Paul S. Morton , a dynamic singer and New Orleans gospel luminary who has worked with Aretha Franklin .
2007_05_01_1844200	37	Then he added another message . ''
2007_05_01_1844200	38	If you are not from New Orleans , '' he said , '' please do n't forget about us . ''
2007_05_01_1844200	39	MUSIC Correction : May 11 , 2007 , Friday A music column on May 1 about the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival referred incorrectly to a song performed by Bonnie Raitt , '' God Was in the Water . ''

2007_05_01_1844201	2	The tales in '' A Model World and Other Stories '' and '' Werewolves in Their Youth '' showcased his ability to do wonderful things with words , to conjure everything from the banalities of daily life to the most bizarre of melodrama , just as '' Wonder Boys '' demonstrated his ability to do slapstick comedy with as much ardor and panache as more serious , emotional material .
2007_05_01_1844201	3	In these earlier stories and novels , however , the author 's copious talents did not always cohere into a satisfying whole : the plots tended to be clumsy and overly contrived ; the tone often lurched uncomfortably between the comic and the somber ; and the language sometimes sounded as if Mr. Chabon were channeling an older writer ( like Philip Roth or John Irving or Nabokov ) instead of honing a voice distinctly his own .
2007_05_01_1844201	4	This all changed with Mr. Chabon 's marvelous , Pulitzer Prize-winning novel , '' The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay '' ( 2000 ) , a big , generous book that was both an ode to the golden era of American comic books and a bravura epic that somehow managed to forge the disparate subjects of World War II , fictional superheroes , Harry Houdini and the Golem of Prague into a sad-funny-moving meditation on life and loss and the consolations of art .
2007_05_01_1844201	5	Mr. Chabon 's latest novel , '' The Yiddish Policemen 's Union , '' builds upon the achievement of '' Kavalier & Clay , '' creating a completely fictional world that is as persuasively detailed as his re-creation of 1940s New York in that earlier book , even as it gives the reader a gripping murder mystery and one of the most appealing detective heroes to come along since Sam Spade or Philip Marlowe .
2007_05_01_1844201	6	Though the ultimate secret behind the murder that kick-starts the story involves a religious-political scheme that tips over clumsily into surreal satire , the remainder of the book is so authoritatively and minutely imagined that the reader , absorbed in the plight of Mr. Chabon 's shambling hero , really does n't mind .
2007_05_01_1844201	7	That hero , one Meyer Landsman by name , is a homicide detective in the Federal District of Sitka , somewhere on the Alaskan panhandle .
2007_05_01_1844201	8	In the alternative universe that Mr. Chabon has imagined , Sitka is the temporary safe haven created for Jews in the wake of the Holocaust ; in his telling , Israel collapsed in 1948 , and refugees have flocked to this remote territory , creating , over the last few decades , a hermetic , self-sustaining world .
2007_05_01_1844201	9	Sixty years have passed , however , and Sitka is now due to revert to American authority .
2007_05_01_1844201	10	The fate of its two million residents is uncertain .
2007_05_01_1844201	11	Many have elected to move abroad -- some to '' the camel lands , '' some to places like Australia and Madagascar ; others are waiting fatalistically in Sitka to see what will happen .
2007_05_01_1844201	12	Landsman is more of a nebbish than your average , hard-boiled detective , but true to the noir tradition , he is an unbeliever , a man shorn of faith in luck , God and human nature .
2007_05_01_1844201	13	His beloved sister Naomi , an ace pilot , died in a freak airplane accident .
2007_05_01_1844201	14	And his marriage of 15 years to another cop named Bina has recently ended .
2007_05_01_1844201	15	He had persuaded Bina to have an abortion after troubling test results revealed that the child she was carrying might develop grave abnormalities ; the doctors said the baby might also be fine , but it was impossible to know .
2007_05_01_1844201	16	Landsman , a perpetual pessimist , had elected against rolling the dice . ''
2007_05_01_1844201	17	Men tend to cry , in Landsman 's experience , '' Mr. Chabon writes , '' when they have been living for a long time with a sense of rightness and safety , and then they realize that all along , just under their boots , lay the abyss .
2007_05_01_1844201	18	That is part of the policeman 's job , to jerk back the pretty carpet that covers over the deep jagged hole in the floor . ''
2007_05_01_1844201	19	Since the collapse of his marriage , Landsman has been living in the seedy Hotel Zamenhof , where , one night , '' somebody has put a bullet in the brain of the occupant of 208 , a yid who was calling himself Emanuel Lasker . ''
2007_05_01_1844201	20	One of the few clues in the room is a chessboard with a mystifying configuration of pieces .
2007_05_01_1844201	21	Landsman 's investigation into Lasker 's death will plunge him into a re-evaluation of his own tortured familial history and his relationship with Bina , who , unexpectedly , has become his new supervisor at work .
2007_05_01_1844201	22	It will cause him to re-examine his feelings about police work and larger , more existential issues .
2007_05_01_1844201	23	And it will threaten to throw him into a spiral of suicidal despair .
2007_05_01_1844201	24	Working with his half-Tlingit partner , Berko , Landsman soon discovers that Lasker is an alias for a troubled heroin addict named Mendel Shpilman , the only son of a powerful rabbi , known for his gangland ties .
2007_05_01_1844201	25	As a child and as a young man , Mendel was not only a chess genius , beating the best and brightest of his elders , but also a brilliant student , rumored to possess magical healing powers .
2007_05_01_1844201	26	There were even whispers that Mendel might be '' the righteous man of this generation '' -- the Messiah , perhaps , arrived to redeem the world .
2007_05_01_1844201	27	How did this '' miracle kid '' wind up a heroin addict , shot dead in a fleabag hotel ?
2007_05_01_1844201	28	What made him disappear the day of his wedding , some two decades ago ?
2007_05_01_1844201	29	Why has his once doting father disowned him ?
2007_05_01_1844201	30	And why are Bina and her superiors pressing to shut down the investigation and declare Mendel 's death a cold case ?
2007_05_01_1844201	31	While Mr. Chabon makes the ultimate answer to these questions -- which has something to do with the highest levels of the United States government , evangelical Christians and the building of the third Temple in Jerusalem -- too far-fetched to be plausible , his account of Landsman 's detective work remains suspenseful and artfully done .
2007_05_01_1844201	32	More important , Mr. Chabon has so thoroughly conjured the fictional world of Sitka -- its history , culture , geography , its incestuous and byzantine political and sectarian divisions -- that the reader comes to take its existence for granted .
2007_05_01_1844201	33	By the end of the book , we feel we know this chilly piece of northern real estate , where Yiddish is the language of choice , the same way we feel we have come to know Meyer Landsman -- this '' secular policeman '' who has learned to sail '' double-hulled against tragedy , '' ever wary of '' the hairline fissures , the little freaks of torque '' that can topple a boat in the shallows .
2007_05_01_1844202	0	The gripping black-and-white photographs of civil rights protesters in the South reflect the black-and-white morality tale that generally accompanies them .
2007_05_01_1844202	1	Hateful , jeering white mobs and attack dogs versus peaceful marchers asking to vote and to walk in the front door .
2007_05_01_1844202	2	That story line is true , but so are others .
2007_05_01_1844202	3	A new generation of historians is exploring some of the untold stories of the civil rights movement and its legacies : the experiences not of heroes or murderous villains , but of ordinary Southern whites .
2007_05_01_1844202	4	And their research is challenging some long-held beliefs about the nation 's political realignment and the origins of modern conservatism . ''
2007_05_01_1844202	5	You want to pry below these great narratives of good and evil and black and white , '' said Jason Sokol , 29 , who wrote '' There Goes My Everything : White Southerners in the Age of Civil Rights , 1945-1975 '' ( Alfred A. Knopf ) . ''
2007_05_01_1844202	6	For those of us who did n't live through it , there 's more of an effort to not simply celebrate the civil rights movement and how extraordinary it was , but to place it within the broader arc of the 20th century . ''
2007_05_01_1844202	7	This new wave of historians , many of them young , believe that one can not understand today 's housing , schooling , economic development or political patterns without understanding the mostly apolitical white Southerners of that era .
2007_05_01_1844202	8	None of these scholars play down the inbred racism of the region , but they argue that the focus on race can obscure broader economic and demographic changes , like the dizzying corporate growth , the migration of white Northerners to the South and the shifting emphasis on class interests after legal segregation ended .
2007_05_01_1844202	9	The conventional wisdom , said Jacquelyn Hall , director of the Southern Oral History Project at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill , is that the general backlash to the civil rights movement '' was exported out of the South to the rest of the country , '' and that the Republican Party benefited from the shift .
2007_05_01_1844202	10	But she said a raft of new scholarship is showing '' the strength of the Republican Party in the South is linked to the economic boom in the South . ''
2007_05_01_1844202	11	Corporations moved down to the once-solidly Democratic South and brought with them traditional suburban Republican voters .
2007_05_01_1844202	12	Their interests matched up with a growing neo-conservatism in the North . ''
2007_05_01_1844202	13	What 's going on is much more a regional convergence story as opposed to the South influencing the rest of the country , '' she said .
2007_05_01_1844202	14	Conservative appeals to limit the government 's reach and emphasize individual freedoms resonated not only in the South , but in the North as well , said Joseph Crespino , 35 , whose book , '' In Search of Another Country : Mississippi and the Conservative Counterrevolution '' ( Princeton University Press ) , was just published .
2007_05_01_1844202	15	The racial and religious conservatism of whites , for instance , '' converged in unexpected ways in the fight over federal tax policy toward Southern private schools , '' Mr. Crespino writes .
2007_05_01_1844202	16	He said that while many Southern whites set up '' segregation academies '' for the sole purpose of avoiding school integration , others were genuinely interested in sending their children to church schools for religious reasons . ''
2007_05_01_1844202	17	By the late '70s , this issue of defending church schools against harassment by the federal government and the I.R.S. , '' Mr. Crespino explained in an interview , led to the '' mobilization of evangelical and fundamentalist Christians . ''
2007_05_01_1844202	18	Mr. Crespino , who grew up in rural Mississippi , said his research was partly inspired by his experience .
2007_05_01_1844202	19	Many of the African-Americans he met in the deeply segregated precincts of Chicago while he was an undergraduate at Northwestern University had come from his home state and were struggling with the same issues they had had down South . ''
2007_05_01_1844202	20	Rather than treating white Mississipians as these racist pariahs in larger postwar liberal America , I wanted to treat them as part of a broader popular reaction against modern liberalism , '' he said . ''
2007_05_01_1844202	21	I wanted to show how central the resistance to civil rights policies were in shaping modern conservative policies . ''
2007_05_01_1844202	22	Mr. Sokol also found the truisms not always to be true . ''
2007_05_01_1844202	23	Everything I had read said that the urban South -- Atlanta , Nashville , Raleigh -- was more progressive than rural backwaters , '' he said .
2007_05_01_1844202	24	Though that is true to a point , Mr. Sokol said , he found '' plenty of instances of retrograde racism in urban areas and the Upper South , '' as well as '' stunning changes in places which in the popular imagination are the worst places in the South . ''
2007_05_01_1844202	25	Like Mr. Crespino , Matthew D. Lassiter was motivated to research his own Southern roots .
2007_05_01_1844202	26	He found a gap between the history he had learned in school and his experience growing up in its wake in Sandy Springs , a white , middle-class suburb of Atlanta . ''
2007_05_01_1844202	27	I was trying to find my own people , my parents and grandparents , '' said Mr. Lassiter , 36 , who wrote '' The Silent Majority : Suburban Politics in the Sunbelt South '' ( Princeton ) published last year . ''
2007_05_01_1844202	28	There were a few white Southerners who were liberals , a larger number throwing the rocks with the rioters and the vast group in the middle were left out of the story . ''
2007_05_01_1844202	29	As a graduate student at the University of Virginia , he taught undergraduates and assigned the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. 's '' Letter From Birmingham Jail , '' in which he wrote , '' I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro 's great stumbling block in his stride towards freedom is not the White Citizen 's Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner , but the white moderate , who is more devoted to ` order ' than justice . ''
2007_05_01_1844202	30	Mr. Lassiter , who now teaches history at the University of Michigan , said : '' Who are these moderates ?
2007_05_01_1844202	31	They do n't seem to be participating , yet they 're completely complicit in the system of Jim Crow . ''
2007_05_01_1844202	32	Mr. Lassiter 's book looks at how the federal government subsidized white flight to the suburbs , where middle-class whites could embrace colorblind values but still maintain all-white enclaves and schools . ''
2007_05_01_1844202	33	When you look at suburbs and middle class , then you start getting a national story , '' he said . ''
2007_05_01_1844202	34	White suburbs outside Charlotte are reacting the same as white suburbs outside Los Angeles or in New Jersey . ''
2007_05_01_1844202	35	Kevin M. Kruse , who grew up in Nashville and now teaches at Princeton University , focuses more on rank-and-file segregationists than moderates .
2007_05_01_1844202	36	In his 2005 book , '' White Flight : Atlanta and the Making of Modern Conservatism '' ( Princeton ) , he argues that in moving to the suburbs , '' white Southern conservatives were forced to abandon their traditional , populist , and often starkly racist demagoguery , and instead craft a new conservatism predicated on a language of rights , freedoms , and individualism . ''
2007_05_01_1844202	37	That Southern whites have become the leading edge of academic research is not all that surprising , Mr. Crespino explained : '' The first generation of scholarship looked at key figures and key organizations .
2007_05_01_1844202	38	The second generation focused on recovering the roots of the movement , and telling the story of African-Americans . '' ''
2007_05_01_1844202	39	One of the topics that was left to the side , '' he said , '' was white Southerners and their resistance to the movement and its implications for national policy . ''
2007_05_01_1844202	40	Taylor Branch , the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of a trilogy on King , suggested that another reason for the long neglect of this group has been the difficulty in getting ordinary white Southerners to tell their stories . ''
2007_05_01_1844202	41	I do think that subject is one of the harder ones to write about because those people are quite reticent and not that prominent , '' he said , referring to people he knew from his own childhood growing up in Atlanta .
2007_05_01_1844202	42	The subject of civil rights made '' otherwise intelligent people seem evasive . ''
2007_05_01_1844202	43	James C. Cobb , a senior historian at the University of Georgia , has written several books about the South and praises the new scholarship .
2007_05_01_1844202	44	Although he said some people may perceive this work as an apologia , there is now generally '' more ideological leeway to go back and see how white people behaved during this period . ''
2007_05_01_1844202	45	Still , he warned , '' You have to be very careful '' not to make this inquiry a justification of veiled racism . ''
2007_05_01_1844202	46	We can go overboard in downplaying the racial angle , '' he said .
2007_05_01_1844202	47	After all , while opposition to busing may not stem from racism , he said , the effects on blacks are the same .
2007_05_01_1844202	48	Although the scholarly books published in the last couple of years focus on widely different areas -- metropolitan power centers , rural backwaters , employment practices , schools -- nearly all make the same point : The idea that the South is exceptional , a region apart from the rest of the country , is no longer true .
2007_05_01_1844202	49	Though the thesis discomfits some professors of Southern history , Mr. Kruse argues '' a lot of those regional differences have really dropped out the closer we get to the present day . ''
2007_05_01_1844202	50	It may turn out that what is most distinctive about the latest research on the South is its claim that the South is no longer distinctive .
2007_05_01_1844202	51	Mr. Lassiter 's and Mr. Crespino 's latest project is editing a book titled '' The End of Southern History . ''
2007_05_01_1844203	0	Alexander Haagen III is an unfamiliar figure to the tens of thousands of music fans who converged in the California desert this past weekend for the annual Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival .
2007_05_01_1844203	1	But more than any rock hero , he wields profound influence here : he is the real estate developer who owns the Empire Polo Club , the gilt-edged grounds where the festival is staged .
2007_05_01_1844203	2	Bands like Rage Against the Machine and the Red Hot Chili Peppers may provide the talent , but the subtle star of the festival is the location itself : more than 70 acres of verdant polo fields , where fans watch the show while lounging on the lawn , which is framed by rows of palm trees and surveys the mountains beyond .
2007_05_01_1844203	3	As many as 60,000 fans converged here each day , with roughly one-fourth of them camping nearby .
2007_05_01_1844203	4	If Coachella is their modern Woodstock -- and for many it is -- then Mr. Haagen is their Max Yasgur , the dairy farmer who allowed his fields to be used for that festival in 1969 .
2007_05_01_1844203	5	But Mr. Haagen , who built the polo grounds two decades ago , is a very different sort of benefactor .
2007_05_01_1844203	6	Coachella has become big business : the festival , which expanded from two days to three this year , had box office sales of over $ 10 million last year .
2007_05_01_1844203	7	Yet even as the event has built an international reputation with its eclectic lineup -- and the sense of community it creates among fans trekking into the desert -- the organizers remain dependent on the venue .
2007_05_01_1844203	8	As a result , they are betting on the willingness of Mr. Haagen to play host to it while forgoing potentially lucrative land development deals .
2007_05_01_1844203	9	Paul Tollett , head of Goldenvoice , the concert promoter who created the festival in 1999 , said that last year he signed a new long-term deal to ensure that Coachella remains at the polo grounds , though he declined to detail the agreement .
2007_05_01_1844203	10	Mr. Tollett , who is staging a new event -- the Stagecoach country music festival -- on the same grounds next weekend said one motivation was to create new revenue for Mr. Haagen and foster his continued support for running mass events there instead of building condominiums . ''
2007_05_01_1844203	11	Obviously , that 's very prime real estate , '' Mr. Tollett said . ''
2007_05_01_1844203	12	What I wanted to do was come through for him for a couple of shows to make it worth his while . ''
2007_05_01_1844203	13	Mr. Haagen , who is in his 60s and who rarely grants interviews , said in a brief encounter Saturday night that '' I like to see people have a good time , '' and that his commitment to the festival was '' long range . ''
2007_05_01_1844203	14	For Mr. Haagen , Coachella has also come to represent an annual chance to entertain friends and business associates , who watch the proceedings from white folding chairs on a canopied terrace overlooking the main stage area .
2007_05_01_1844203	15	His family participates , too : one of Mr. Haagen 's sons , Andrew , is the event 's resident photographer , receiving greater access than press photographers and maintaining his own portrait studio amid the private artist encampment .
2007_05_01_1844203	16	But several people who have conducted business with the festival 's organizers said the relationship between Mr. Haagen and the promoters has been a trying one .
2007_05_01_1844203	17	Mr. Haagen '' usually has these guys tearing their hair out trying to appease him , '' said Tim Vail , a veterinarian who owns an equine hospital nearby , and who rented some of his property to organizers for parking this year .
2007_05_01_1844203	18	Coachella has been credited with reviving large-scale music festivals in America .
2007_05_01_1844203	19	Mr. Tollett has said the model for the event is the European festivals like Glastonbury ( which is controlled by Michael Eavis , a farmer who runs both the land and the festival ) .
2007_05_01_1844203	20	But since such events often require big , unconventional sites , concert organizers may find themselves dealing more regularly with property owners who lack experience or interest in the live-entertainment business .
2007_05_01_1844203	21	Some promoters are tempted to sidestep that hurdle .
2007_05_01_1844203	22	Earlier this year , organizers of the annual Bonnaroo music festival in Manchester , Tenn. , purchased 500 acres of land from the farmer who owned the property that housed the event .
2007_05_01_1844203	23	Ashley Capps , one of the concert organizers , said they sought direct control of the land to install water and electrical lines -- and to remove any doubts about the farm as a venue .
2007_05_01_1844203	24	Mr. Capps said the producers ' relations with the landowner '' was not peaches and cream . ''
2007_05_01_1844203	25	Though he adds that '' it never got terrible , '' he said that '' farmers who own large pieces of land tend to be very individualistic in their thinking . ''
2007_05_01_1844203	26	Mr. Haagen 's first encounter with accommodating a big rock concert was in 1993 , when Goldenvoice helped arrange a performance on the polo grounds by Pearl Jam .
2007_05_01_1844203	27	Six years later , Mr. Tollett sought out Mr. Haagen again when he needed a locale for Coachella .
2007_05_01_1844203	28	But the first festival posted a loss , forcing Goldenvoice to the edge of financial ruin .
2007_05_01_1844203	29	AEG Live , a bigger concert promoter , acquired the company in 2001 by absorbing its debt , which exceeded $ 1 million , according to executives involved in the deal .
2007_05_01_1844203	30	Goldenvoice had been unable to mount a festival in 2000 , but returned to the polo fields with Coachella in 2001 and has every year since .
2007_05_01_1844203	31	Mr. Haagen has earned a reputation as a hard-nosed deal-maker in the real estate world -- and as a politically connected one .
2007_05_01_1844203	32	In years past , his family has contributed generously to the campaigns of local and statewide political candidates , and Mr. Haagen has become a regular , though modest , donor to the Republican Party .
2007_05_01_1844203	33	He spent much of his career working at the commercial real estate company started by his father , a former welder and merchant marine who after World War II started buying up corner lots to be resold to oil companies and turned into service stations .
2007_05_01_1844203	34	But the Haagens ultimately made their reputation by building retail shopping centers in the inner city .
2007_05_01_1844203	35	By the late 1990s , though , the company was laden with debt .
2007_05_01_1844203	36	An affiliate of the investment bank Lazard agreed to purchase a stake in the Haagens ' company for $ 235 million in 1997 , and then bought the family out .
2007_05_01_1844203	37	As alternative rock fans swarmed over his property this weekend , Mr. Haagen seemed to play the silent patron contentedly enough .
2007_05_01_1844203	38	On Saturday night , Mr. Haagen , wearing a white cowboy hat and a black Coachella T-shirt , held court on his private terrace , surrounded by his guests , palm trees and a pond filled with lily pads .
2007_05_01_1844203	39	On Sunday night , during Rage Against the Machine 's festival-closing set , a couple of young fans from the V.I.P. section scaled the fence into Mr. Haagen 's domain .
2007_05_01_1844203	40	While they were quickly ejected , some of his panicked guests hurriedly made for the exits .
2007_05_01_1844204	0	As tarmac-sitting stories mount and the Transportation Department investigates the possibility of unrealistic flight schedules , nutrition experts are in agreement : carry-on food is crucial for business travelers .
2007_05_01_1844204	1	This is not because extra , unplanned hours without food or water can be fatal .
2007_05_01_1844204	2	Most adults can survive at least three days without water and about three weeks without food , according to the '' Rule of 3 's in Survival '' on the Federal Emergency Management Agency Web site .
2007_05_01_1844204	3	It is because anxiety can stimulate hunger and thirst , and unquenched needs can turn an unpleasant event to misery . ''
2007_05_01_1844204	4	You never know what 's going to happen , '' said Nancy Clark , a registered dietitian in Chestnut Hill , Mass. , who has written books about the nutrition needs of distance cyclists , marathon runners and other athletes . ''
2007_05_01_1844204	5	It 's always wise to have emergency food with you . ''
2007_05_01_1844204	6	Bonnie Taub-Dix , a spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association who has , on occasion , found herself at meetings with no food or drink provided , takes a more self-sufficient view . ''
2007_05_01_1844204	7	Never count on anyone , that 's the bottom line . '' ''
2007_05_01_1844204	8	If you 're traveling and going to a meeting , you want to be fresh , '' she said . ''
2007_05_01_1844204	9	If you have to give a presentation , already you 're not in a relaxed position .
2007_05_01_1844204	10	If there 's a delay in traveling , it could be stressful .
2007_05_01_1844204	11	The likelihood is that you wo n't be comfortable .
2007_05_01_1844204	12	You wo n't sleep . ''
2007_05_01_1844204	13	At best , she said , a food kit can help travelers fuel themselves so that they can think clearly .
2007_05_01_1844204	14	With little prompting , she recited in detail a February business trip to Athens that stretched into a 35-hour ordeal , including 10 hours on the tarmac with no food or water provided by the airline .
2007_05_01_1844204	15	But she and another spokeswoman at the association , Tara Gidus , were in better shape than many on the plane : They had their stash .
2007_05_01_1844204	16	Ms. Gidus , a registered dietitian in the Orlando area , said that an emergency food kit can also serve another function : It helps travelers hold their tempers . ''
2007_05_01_1844204	17	Stress brings out the worst in people , and couple that with hunger -- there were people who were very upset . ''
2007_05_01_1844204	18	Sharon R. Akabas , a nutrition professor at Columbia University , said it was an issue of perception . ''
2007_05_01_1844204	19	Someone trapped on the tarmac is n't in danger compared to someone trapped in the snow on Mount Hood , '' she said . ''
2007_05_01_1844204	20	But ask those people on the plane in the seventh hour , or the 11th hour , and they may not feel any differently . ''
2007_05_01_1844204	21	But beyond a few intensely personal comfort foods -- lemon drops , or say , Twizzlers -- what is best in an emergency food kit ?
2007_05_01_1844204	22	There is a Plan A , which is making food at home and packing it in your bag -- those are the best intentions , said Dawn Jackson Blatner , also a spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association , a cooking instructor and a registered dietitian at the Wellness Institute at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago . ''
2007_05_01_1844204	23	That 's when you have full control .
2007_05_01_1844204	24	You know portions , you pack whole grains , and one-ounce baggies of nuts . ''
2007_05_01_1844204	25	And there 's Plan B , when people can not get it together , but seek out healthy foods in the airport -- pieces of fruit ( the fiber and water contribute to a long-lasting feeling of satiety ) , whole-grain granola bars or nuts .
2007_05_01_1844204	26	Additionally , government regulations now limit travelers to only as many three-ounce bottles of liquid as they can stuff in a one-quart zip-lock bag .
2007_05_01_1844204	27	So buying a couple of 16-ounce bottles of water , or yogurt , is best left until after the security line .
2007_05_01_1844204	28	Otherwise , inspiration comes from hikers , campers , runners , cyclists and climbers -- all of whom want nutrient-dense foods that take up little space and require no refrigeration .
2007_05_01_1844204	29	And nutrition experts say travelers could throw in a little extra to share with a testy seatmate or flight attendant .
2007_05_01_1844204	30	For Ms. Taub-Dix , the standout travel food is peanut butter , whether on whole-grain bread and packed at home , or bought in 3/4-ounce portions and used as a dip for crackers . ''
2007_05_01_1844204	31	It 's one food that feels like it 's decadent , but it really is great , and very satisfying . ''
2007_05_01_1844204	32	Ms. Clark agreed , saying that she packs two peanut butter sandwiches before every trip . ''
2007_05_01_1844204	33	It 's cheap and tasty .
2007_05_01_1844204	34	If it squishes , it 's still edible -- a nice security blanket . ''
2007_05_01_1844204	35	Nutrition bars , once the domain of runners , are portable food and for some , can rival peanut butter in comfort , as long as they provide a balance of carbohydrate , protein and fat , Ms. Taub-Dix said .
2007_05_01_1844204	36	She had one stowed away for her Greek odyssey , along with a bag containing mixed nuts and dried fruit ( her favorites are roasted almonds , cashews and dried apricots ) .
2007_05_01_1844204	37	Other items in an emergency food kit can include processed cheese , dried meats ( jerky-style products ) , popcorn , and trail mix .
2007_05_01_1844204	38	A traveler can add bits of almost any finger food to the basics of nuts and dried fruits : coconut , dry cereal , pretzels , even chocolate ( plain or wrapped around nuts ) , which makes nearly everyone 's list . ''
2007_05_01_1844204	39	I had some of that , '' said Ms. Gidus , recalling her trip to Greece in the first few months of her pregnancy . ''
2007_05_01_1844204	40	It 's one of those stress foods -- it relaxes people , and it brings comfort , and it 's high-energy as well . ''
2007_05_01_1844204	41	Once the emergency food kit is assembled , add a few nonfood items : hand sanitizer ( in the government-regulated tiny bottles ) , moist towelettes , travel-size board games and a deck of cards .
2007_05_01_1844204	42	And if the time comes that tarmac-sitting is required , surviving the experience with dignity begins with a good attitude , and the discipline of rationing the resources . ''
2007_05_01_1844204	43	Some people see food as an annoyance , or a pain , '' Ms. Clark said . ''
2007_05_01_1844204	44	Get in the mindset that it 's fuel , and people need fuel every four hours . ''
2007_05_01_1844204	45	That , she said , can make the difference .
2007_05_01_1844204	46	For Ms. Taub-Dix , it did . ''
2007_05_01_1844204	47	I bought a bottle of water .
2007_05_01_1844204	48	I had my snacks .
2007_05_01_1844204	49	I had my laptop .
2007_05_01_1844204	50	Food , clothing , shelter , '' she said , reciting a variation of Abraham Maslow 's hierarchy of human needs . ''
2007_05_01_1844204	51	I did n't have love , but I had my phone .
2007_05_01_1844204	52	I was happy I was taken care of . ''
2007_05_01_1844205	0	HOW about some good news for a change ?
2007_05_01_1844205	1	Business-class fares on trans-Atlantic routes are coming down .
2007_05_01_1844205	2	Major airlines are improving their international routes and reducing capacity on domestic routes as lower-fare competition becomes more aggressive .
2007_05_01_1844205	3	Two low-fare start-ups -- MaxJet and Silverjet -- say they are creating a bigger pool of business-class passengers who are willing ( or able , under corporate policies ) to pay a little more for a lot more comfort .
2007_05_01_1844205	4	Meanwhile , the third low-fare all-business-class start-up , Eos , says it has settled comfortably into a new discount-fare niche in the top quality business-class market across the Atlantic .
2007_05_01_1844205	5	The New York to London route , the most lucrative in the industry for premium-class travel , is in flux .
2007_05_01_1844205	6	It 's still possible to pay a fortune for a walk-up business class seat , of course .
2007_05_01_1844205	7	Yesterday , I checked walk-up fares on two international airlines that have what are considered to be top business-class service , British Airways and Virgin Atlantic .
2007_05_01_1844205	8	They were just over $ 10,000 . ''
2007_05_01_1844205	9	They 're offering a superb product , but that is really an incredibly large amount of money , '' said Joshua Marks , the vice president for planning at MaxJet , which purports to be generating a good part of its market from business passengers who used to fly coach or premium coach .
2007_05_01_1844205	10	United States airlines used to closely match walk-up fares on competitors like British Airways , but not anymore .
2007_05_01_1844205	11	The walk-up New York to London round-trip fare on American Airlines yesterday was $ 7,723 .
2007_05_01_1844205	12	And if booked yesterday for a flight in three weeks , business-class fares on major United States airlines dropped to the $ 3,500 level , while British Air was charging about $ 7,000 .
2007_05_01_1844205	13	Airlines make most of their money on trans-Atlantic routes in first and business class .
2007_05_01_1844205	14	Coach is usually a drain on profits , which is why an all-business-class airline with an enticing fare structure can compete , even without the sort of scheduling frequency that major airlines offer . ''
2007_05_01_1844205	15	We 're not subsidizing cheapskates like me , who used to travel only in economy , '' said Lawrence Hunt , the chief executive officer and a founder of Silverjet , a British-based airline that has been flying New York to London ( actually Newark to London ) for just over two months .
2007_05_01_1844205	16	Silverjet flies a 767 with 100 all business-class seats .
2007_05_01_1844205	17	The average fare New York to London is '' slightly over $ 2,000 , '' Mr. Hunt said .
2007_05_01_1844205	18	On major carriers , the average fare on that route is around $ 5,500 , which takes into account volume discounts negotiated by major customers .
2007_05_01_1844205	19	A major American investment bank , considered one of the highest-volume customers , pays around $ 3,000 round trip on American Airlines , Mr. Hunt says .
2007_05_01_1844205	20	Typical high-volume corporate discount rates are about $ 6,000 , but small-business travelers and entrepreneurs who do n't book well in advance often end up paying the walk-up fare .
2007_05_01_1844205	21	On Silverjet , the walk-up fare can go as high as $ 4,000 in peak-demand periods .
2007_05_01_1844205	22	But , Mr. Hunt said , '' on some days you 'll be paying $ 1,700 round trip . ''
2007_05_01_1844205	23	Silverjet recently bought a second 767 aircraft . ''
2007_05_01_1844205	24	I took the keys on Thursday , '' Mr. Hunt said .
2007_05_01_1844205	25	It will be used for a second New York to London flight starting in July .
2007_05_01_1844205	26	The company expects to take delivery of a third aircraft in November and use it either for New York to London service , or to provide London service from another United States city , such as Los Angeles , Chicago or Miami .
2007_05_01_1844205	27	Silverjet says it had a load factor -- the percentage of seats full -- of 59 percent in March . ''
2007_05_01_1844205	28	That 's almost unprecedented for a carrier in its second month of operation , '' Mr. Hunt said .
2007_05_01_1844205	29	MaxJet flies between New York and London and Las Vegas and London and is about to resume its flights between Washington and London , which were suspended for the winter .
2007_05_01_1844205	30	Average fares are about $ 2,000 , Mr. Marks said .
2007_05_01_1844205	31	MaxJet says its business-class service is comparable to that on United States airlines . ''
2007_05_01_1844205	32	We 're not trying to compete with the best of the best , '' Mr. Marks said . ''
2007_05_01_1844205	33	But we are showing that with a good product , people will pay more to get out of economy class . ''
2007_05_01_1844205	34	Eos , on the other hand , competes with the luxury service on top-level business and first-class airlines like British Airways and Virgin Atlantic on the trans-Atlantic route .
2007_05_01_1844205	35	Eos flies 757s , which typically carry more than 200 passengers , outfitted with just 48 lie-flat seats .
2007_05_01_1844205	36	Its new schedule between New York and London offers three flights on most days , for a total of 32 flights a week .
2007_05_01_1844205	37	If you wanted to fly Eos today and booked yesterday , the walk-up fare would have been $ 7,500 -- still lower than most airlines .
2007_05_01_1844205	38	Booked weeks in advance , the fare is $ 3,200 and less .
2007_05_01_1844205	39	Meanwhile , Eos also just introduced a new advertising campaign with a keyword that we 'll seldom hear applied ever again to air travel : '' Uncrowded . ''
2007_05_01_1844205	40	ON THE ROAD E-mail : jsharkey@nytimes.com
2007_05_01_1844207	0	Tommy Newsom , the good-humored backup bandleader on '' The Tonight Show '' who earned fame as Johnny Carson 's comical punching bag -- and respect among musicians as a composer , arranger and saxophone soloist -- died on Saturday at his home in Portsmouth , Va. .
2007_05_01_1844207	1	The cause was cancer , his nephew Jim Newsom told The Associated Press .
2007_05_01_1844207	2	Mr. Carson famously delighted in tossing barbs at his regular bandleader , Doc Severinsen , often concerning his flamboyant personality and garish attire .
2007_05_01_1844207	3	Mr. Newsom , who favored conservative brown suits , got lambasted for his tameness .
2007_05_01_1844207	4	Mr. Carson called him '' the man from bland , '' '' Mr. Excitement '' and the '' comatose commander . ''
2007_05_01_1844207	5	He once compared Mr. Newsom to oatmeal , saying , '' It wo n't hurt you , but you do n't look forward to it . ''
2007_05_01_1844207	6	He once even offered a line from a prospective obituary for Mr. Newsom : '' He died of natural dullness . ''
2007_05_01_1844207	7	Mr. Newsom said in a 2005 interview with The Virginian-Pilot that he did not mind the harpoons , because Mr. Carson prefaced them by saying what a great musician he was .
2007_05_01_1844207	8	It was a widely shared view .
2007_05_01_1844207	9	In addition to being assistant music director of the orchestra for '' The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson , '' he published hundreds of arrangements and compositions .
2007_05_01_1844207	10	Among those who performed his works were Skitch Henderson , Woody Herman , Beverly Sills , Kenny Rogers , Charlie Byrd and John Denver .
2007_05_01_1844207	11	He toured South America and the Soviet Union with Benny Goodman , and performed on records with artists like Buck Clayton , a trumpeter for Count Basie .
2007_05_01_1844207	12	His arrangements were cited in Emmy Awards for musical direction given to '' Night of 100 Stars '' in 1982 and '' The 40th Annual Tony Awards Show '' in 1986 .
2007_05_01_1844207	13	He wrote and arranged symphonic pieces .
2007_05_01_1844207	14	Beginning in 1992 , Mr. Newsom did arrangements and compositions for the Diva Jazz Orchestra , a respected all-female band .
2007_05_01_1844207	15	Sherry Maricle , the band 's leader , said in an interview yesterday that he factored in the talent of each individual player , as well as the overall sound of the group .
2007_05_01_1844207	16	She lauded his '' sense of swing . ''
2007_05_01_1844207	17	Thomas Penn Newsom was born in Portsmouth on Feb. 25 , 1929 .
2007_05_01_1844207	18	As a young boy , he stared longingly at saxophones ' shiny keys in pawnshop windows , and his parents bought him one when he was 8 .
2007_05_01_1844207	19	He started performing with older musicians when he was 13 at the Elk 's Club and similar settings . ''
2007_05_01_1844207	20	It was a lust , '' he said , referring to his infatuation with music as a teenager in an interview with The Los Angeles Times in 1992 . ''
2007_05_01_1844207	21	I had to do it . ''
2007_05_01_1844207	22	Mr. Newsom attended the Norfolk Division of the College of a William & Mary , a junior college that became Old Dominion University .
2007_05_01_1844207	23	He earned his bachelor 's degree in musical education from the Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore , where he paid some of his tuition by playing in strip joints .
2007_05_01_1844207	24	He then played with Airman of Note , an Air Force jazz ensemble during a four-year enlistment .
2007_05_01_1844207	25	He next earned a master 's degree at Columbia University .
2007_05_01_1844207	26	His professional break came when Goodman hired him to tour with his band .
2007_05_01_1844207	27	A member of Goodman 's band recommended him to Merv Griffin , and he won a spot on Mr. Griffin 's afternoon show .
2007_05_01_1844207	28	That led to '' Tonight , '' where he began on April 2 , 1962 .
2007_05_01_1844207	29	Mr. Carson took over as host six months later .
2007_05_01_1844207	30	The two retired together on May 22 , 1992 .
2007_05_01_1844207	31	Mr. Carson died in 2005 .
2007_05_01_1844207	32	Mr. Newsom is survived by his wife of 50 years , Patricia , and their daughter , Candy Newsom of Teaneck , N.J. .
2007_05_01_1844207	33	He insisted in interviews that he never minded not being the principal '' Tonight '' bandleader , nor did he mind Mr. Carson 's insults .
2007_05_01_1844207	34	A few times , though , Mr. Newsom refused to let Mr. Carson have the last word .
2007_05_01_1844207	35	Once , he discarded his customary conservative garb and wore a screaming yellow suit , and Mr. Carson cracked , '' Look at that big , dumb canary . '' ''
2007_05_01_1844207	36	You 'll know what kind of bird I am when I fly over you , '' Mr. Newsom replied .
2007_05_01_1844207	37	Correction : May 2 , 2007 , Wednesday An obituary yesterday about Tommy Newsom , the backup bandleader for '' The Tonight Show '' whom Johnny Carson used as a comical target , misstated part of the name of the Air Force jazz ensemble in which he played .
2007_05_01_1844207	38	It is the Airmen of Note , not Airman .
2007_05_01_1844208	0	Elliott P. Skinner , a former United States ambassador to the Republic of Upper Volta , the West African nation now known as Burkina Faso , and a former chairman of the anthropology department at Columbia University , died April 1 at his home in Washington .
2007_05_01_1844208	1	The cause was heart failure , said his wife , Gwendolyn Mikell , director of African studies at the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University .
2007_05_01_1844208	2	Dr. Skinner was a professor at Columbia from 1954 to 1994 and was named chairman of the anthropology department in 1972 , becoming the first African-American department chairman in the university 's history .
2007_05_01_1844208	3	In 1966 , President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed him ambassador to Upper Volta , a post he held until 1969 .
2007_05_01_1844208	4	Dr. Mikell said her husband , the author of 12 books , was particularly concerned that United States foreign policy '' be informed by accurate knowledge of Africa , '' and that African-Americans contributed to the formation of those policies .
2007_05_01_1844208	5	Among Dr. Skinner 's books are '' The Mossi of Upper Volta '' ( Stanford University Press , 1964 ) and '' African-Americans and United States Policy Toward Africa 1850-1924 '' ( Howard University Press , 1992 ) .
2007_05_01_1844208	6	Elliott Percival Skinner was born in Port of Spain , Trinidad , on June 20 , 1924 .
2007_05_01_1844208	7	He came to the United States in 1943 and enlisted in the Army a month later .
2007_05_01_1844208	8	His military service , including combat in France , allowed him to become an American citizen .
2007_05_01_1844208	9	He graduated from New York University in 1951 .
2007_05_01_1844208	10	He earned a master 's degree at Columbia a year later and his doctorate there in 1955 .
2007_05_01_1844208	11	For two years , he lived in West Africa , where he learned Mossi , the language of the Upper Volta region .
2007_05_01_1844208	12	Dr. Skinner and his first wife , Thelma , divorced in 1977 .
2007_05_01_1844208	13	In addition to his wife , Dr. Mikell , Dr. Skinner is survived by two daughters , Gale Holland of Spring Valley , N.Y. , and Luce Remy of Washington ; three sons , Victor , of Manhattan , Sagha , of Yellow Springs , Ohio , and Touray , of Freehold , N.J. ; two sisters , Patricia Smith of Wichita , Kan. , and Bernice Walcott of Caracas , Venezuela ; two brothers , Robert , of San Francisco , and Morris , of Brooklyn ; seven grandchildren ; and one great-grandchild .
2007_05_01_1844209	0	Climate scientists may have significantly underestimated the power of global warming from human-generated heat-trapping gases to shrink the cap of sea ice floating on the Arctic Ocean , according to a new study of polar trends .
2007_05_01_1844209	1	The study , published online today in Geophysical Research Letters , concluded that an open-water Arctic in summers could be more likely in this century than had been estimated in the latest international review of climate research released in February by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change . ''
2007_05_01_1844209	2	There are huge changes going on , '' said Julienne Stroeve , a lead author of the new study and a researcher at the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder , Colo. '' Just with warm waters entering the Arctic , combined with warming air temperatures , this is wreaking havoc on the sea ice , really . ''
2007_05_01_1844209	3	The intergovernmental panel concluded that if emissions of heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide were not significantly reduced , the region could be end up bereft of floating ice in summers sometime between 2050 and the early decades of the next century .
2007_05_01_1844209	4	For the new study , Dr. Stroeve and others at the ice center reviewed nearly six decades of measurements by ships , airplanes and satellites estimating the maximum and minimum area of Arctic sea ice , which typically expands most in March and shrinks most in September .
2007_05_01_1844209	5	With an expert from the National Center for Atmospheric Research , also in Boulder , they then compared the observed trends with the projections made for the climate panel 's review using the world 's most advanced computer models of climate .
2007_05_01_1844209	6	Dr. Stroeve 's team found that since 1953 the area of sea ice in September has declined at an average rate of 7.8 percent per decade .
2007_05_01_1844209	7	Computer climate simulations of the same period had an average rate of ice loss of 2.5 percent per decade .
2007_05_01_1844209	8	The finding implies that the Arctic ice may be quicker to respond to warming as concentrations of heat-trapping gases rise in coming decades , said Marika Holland , an author of the new paper and a computer modeler at the Boulder climate center .
2007_05_01_1844210	0	Pratt Institute , a New York art and design college , had a deal in 2005 with a student loan company : The lender would provide grant money for needy students if Pratt students over all took out $ 1 million or more in loans .
2007_05_01_1844210	1	But last year , Pratt found that the deal was not so good for its student borrowers .
2007_05_01_1844210	2	The company , Education Finance Partners of San Francisco , was charging borrowers 15 percent in interest -- more than double the 6.8 percent rate on some federal loans and higher than what some credit cards charge .
2007_05_01_1844210	3	Pratt canceled the deal and stopped recommending Education Finance to its students .
2007_05_01_1844210	4	Details of the arrangement , and its cancellation , were disclosed yesterday by Pratt and Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo of New York .
2007_05_01_1844210	5	Pratt , along with five other colleges , agreed to adopt a code of conduct governing relationships with loan companies .
2007_05_01_1844210	6	Mr. Cuomo 's office , which has been investigating ties between loan companies and universities for months , announced the new agreements yesterday .
2007_05_01_1844210	7	Pratt 's findings that its students were being charged such high interest rates are the first evidence to emerge from Mr. Cuomo 's inquiry showing how students could have suffered from undisclosed arrangements between universities and lenders that the attorney general has branded a conflict of interest .
2007_05_01_1844210	8	As numerous cases have emerged of universities ' getting payments to steer loan volume to a lender , or of university officials ' getting gifts and payments , many college officials have said that the rates offered by recommended lenders were competitive .
2007_05_01_1844210	9	It appears that in this case , as soon as Pratt learned of the high interest rate , it acted to cancel the relationship with the lender .
2007_05_01_1844210	10	Thomas F. Schutte , president of Pratt , said in a statement released to students and faculty members that he was '' pleased to inform you that Pratt is in complete compliance '' with the code of conduct .
2007_05_01_1844210	11	Besides Pratt , three New York colleges -- Marist College , Manhattanville College and Mercy College -- agreed to the code of conduct .
2007_05_01_1844210	12	So did Lewis & Clark College in Oregon and Texas Christian University , which also agreed to pay to student borrowers more than $ 13,000 that it received from one lender in exchange for greater student loan volume . ''
2007_05_01_1844210	13	Schools and lenders are no longer defending these practices or refusing to recognize the problem , '' Mr. Cuomo said . ''
2007_05_01_1844210	14	They are looking for a solution . ''
2007_05_01_1844210	15	With the six new colleges , 21 institutions , along with some of the nation 's largest student loan companies , have adopted the code of conduct , according to Mr. Cuomo 's office , and the New York Senate has passed legislation to put it into law .
2007_05_01_1844210	16	At Pratt , in addition to the arrangement with Education Finance Partners , an employee served on the advisory board and received trips from another lender .
2007_05_01_1844210	17	Education Finance reached a separate agreement with Mr. Cuomo 's office in mid-April , adopting his code of conduct and paying $ 2.5 million into a fund for education of students and parents about financial aid .
2007_05_01_1844210	18	Mercy College had a contract with Sallie Mae , the nation 's largest student lender , to operate a call center on behalf of the financial aid office , Mr. Cuomo 's office said , and call center operators did not identify themselves as Sallie Mae employees .
2007_05_01_1844210	19	At Marist College , employees served on advisory boards to loan companies and received trips .
2007_05_01_1844210	20	An employee at Manhattanville College received theater tickets from Nelnet , another student loan company , and some lenders provided printing services to the institution .
2007_05_01_1844210	21	Lewis & Clark and Texas Christian both had '' revenue sharing '' agreements , in which Education Finance paid the college based on loan volume .
2007_05_01_1844210	22	Lewis & Clark has already returned the money .
2007_05_01_1844210	23	Separately , the New York State Higher Education Services Corporation , which administers scholarship programs in New York and that guarantees federal student loans against default , also adopted the code of conduct .
2007_05_01_1844211	0	Mayor Shirley Franklin defended the city 's police chief Monday against charges by federal prosecutors that a '' culture of misconduct '' in the Police Department contributed to the shooting death of an elderly woman in a botched drug raid last fall . ''
2007_05_01_1844211	1	The suggestion that our officers performed at anything less than the highest standards of ethics and training is a problem , '' Ms. Franklin said in her first public response to the prosecutors ' comments .
2007_05_01_1844211	2	But she said she was satisfied with the job the police chief , Richard Pennington , was doing and had no plans to fire him . ''
2007_05_01_1844211	3	It would never occur to me the people of Atlanta would want to reverse the trend '' of falling crime under Chief Pennington , Ms. Franklin said .
2007_05_01_1844211	4	With Chief Pennington and Assistant Police Chief Alan Dreher behind her , Ms. Franklin chastised reporters who were asking questions about details in court documents released on Thursday .
2007_05_01_1844211	5	Those documents suggested that narcotics officers often lied to obtain search warrants and planted evidence to make drug cases , as they had done when they raided the home of the woman , Kathryn Johnston .
2007_05_01_1844211	6	The mayor said she had already worked with Chief Pennington to adopt reforms in response to the shooting , including increasing the size of the narcotics unit to 30 officers from 8 .
2007_05_01_1844211	7	She said that they were also reviewing the department 's training procedures and that they planned to require police officers to take drug tests for the first time .
2007_05_01_1844211	8	Ms. Franklin was on a business trip to Asia on Thursday when David Nahmias , the United States attorney , released preliminary details of a federal investigation into the death of Ms. Johnston .
2007_05_01_1844211	9	Since her return she has been under pressure to respond to testimony given by officers involved in the shooting that they had not been given adequate training to do their jobs and that they cut corners by lying and falsifying evidence because they were under pressure to meet '' performance targets '' instituted by Chief Pennington .
2007_05_01_1844211	10	Chief Pennington has denied that the department asks officers to meet quotas , and he did so again on Monday .
2007_05_01_1844211	11	But he conceded : '' Yes , we have performance measures in the Atlanta Police Department .
2007_05_01_1844211	12	We have to have performance measures because if we do n't have them , the officers would come in every day with nothing on their sheets . ''
2007_05_01_1844212	0	Thirty-four first-year business graduate students at Duke University cheated on a take-home final exam , a judicial board has found , in what officials called the most widespread cheating episode in the business school 's history .
2007_05_01_1844212	1	The final was an open-book test in a required course in March , with students told to take the exam on their own .
2007_05_01_1844212	2	But many students collaborated , in violation of the school 's honor code , according to a ruling last week by the judicial board of the Fuqua School of Business at Duke .
2007_05_01_1844212	3	School officials declined to identify the course , the professor or the students , citing confidentiality in judicial board matters .
2007_05_01_1844212	4	But they indicated that the professor had noticed similarities in the answers by the students , who are candidates for a master 's in business administration .
2007_05_01_1844212	5	Nine of the students face expulsion , according to the ruling , which was distributed within the business school on Friday .
2007_05_01_1844212	6	Fifteen students were suspended for a year and given a failing grade in the course ; nine were given a failing grade in the course , and one got a failing grade on the exam .
2007_05_01_1844212	7	Four students accused of cheating were exonerated .
2007_05_01_1844212	8	The students are likely to appeal and are permitted to attend classes while awaiting decisions , which are expected over the next month .
2007_05_01_1844212	9	In general , fewer than 10 students a year at the business school are found guilty of cheating , and some years no accusations are brought to the judicial board , said Michael Hemmerich , associate dean for marketing and communications at the business school .
2007_05_01_1844212	10	National surveys have suggested that cheating is widespread among graduate students .
2007_05_01_1844212	11	In a survey released last September by a Rutgers University professor , 56 percent of business graduate students admitted having cheated , compared with 54 percent in engineering , 48 percent in education and 45 percent in law school .
2007_05_01_1844212	12	More than 5,300 students at 54 universities were surveyed from 2002 to 2004 . ''
2007_05_01_1844212	13	This is self-reported evidence of cheating , so it 's probably underestimated , '' said Donald McCabe , a professor of management and global business at Rutgers who oversaw the survey . ''
2007_05_01_1844212	14	I would say at many business schools it is a part of the culture , '' Dr. McCabe said . ''
2007_05_01_1844212	15	You want to talk rationalizations ?
2007_05_01_1844212	16	I could give you thousands of them : everybody else does it , it 's the teachers ' fault , you have to do it to get ahead . ''
2007_05_01_1844212	17	Many of the country 's leading business schools , including Duke 's , have been emphasizing honesty and ethical conduct , introducing new courses in business ethics and creating tough honor codes .
2007_05_01_1844212	18	Dr. McCabe said , however , that administrators at many of those schools did not appreciate the extent of cheating .
2007_05_01_1844212	19	At Columbia University 's Graduate School of Journalism , an accusation surfaced in December that some students had cheated on an open-book , take-home exam in a course on journalistic ethics .
2007_05_01_1844212	20	Officials said then that the matter would be referred to the journalism school 's disciplinary committee .
2007_05_01_1844212	21	Barbara Fasciani , a spokeswoman for the school , said yesterday that she could not comment on the outcome of the case , because disciplinary committee matters were confidential .
2007_05_01_1844212	22	The exam was designed to be completed in 90 minutes , but students could gain access to the test by computer any time during a 30-hour period .
2007_05_01_1844212	23	At least one student who had taken the exam reportedly offered to tell at least one other student who had not yet taken it what the essay questions were . ''
2007_05_01_1844212	24	I can be fairly sure that the test will not be administered in the same way next year , '' Ms. Fasciani said .
2007_05_01_1844212	25	At Ohio University , officials have been investigating for many months a cheating scandal that began with an accusation that more than 20 mechanical engineering students had plagiarized parts of their master 's theses , some as long as 20 years ago .
2007_05_01_1844212	26	More than 200 master 's theses and Ph.D. dissertations have now been examined , university officials said .
2007_05_01_1844212	27	So far , the university has revoked the master 's degree of a former student for plagiarism , and a committee has recommended that five students be dismissed and 12 others be ordered to rewrite their theses .
2007_05_01_1844212	28	More cases will be heard this spring .
2007_05_01_1844213	0	An Israeli government commission excoriated Prime Minister Ehud Olmert on Monday for '' severe failures '' in last summer 's war against the Lebanese militia Hezbollah , setting off a furious debate on whether he should remain in office .
2007_05_01_1844213	1	The commission accused him of having decided hastily to go to war , neglecting to ask for a detailed military plan , refusing to consult outside the army and setting '' over-ambitious and unobtainable goals . ''
2007_05_01_1844213	2	One result , the commission said , was that Mr. Olmert had been responsible for '' a severe failure in exercising judgment , responsibility and prudence . ''
2007_05_01_1844213	3	Mr. Olmert appeared briefly on Monday night on Israeli television and radio to say that '' it would not be right for me to resign and I will not do so . ''
2007_05_01_1844213	4	Instead , he said , he would appoint a team to study the report fully and carry out its recommendations , and he praised the commission for its work . ''
2007_05_01_1844213	5	Failures will be remedied , '' he said .
2007_05_01_1844213	6	The commission 's language was harsher than Israelis had been led to expect from a series of leaks , although the report , which limited itself to the first five days of the war , did not call on Mr. Olmert to resign .
2007_05_01_1844213	7	A second part of the report , on the rest of the war , is to be published this summer .
2007_05_01_1844213	8	The commission 's findings nonetheless reduce Mr. Olmert 's chances of recovering already badly damaged political credibility .
2007_05_01_1844213	9	The commission also sharply criticized the defense minister , Amir Peretz of the Labor Party , whose career is already in tatters , and the chief of staff at the time , Lt. Gen. Dan Halutz , who has already resigned . ''
2007_05_01_1844213	10	We single out these three because it is likely that had any of them acted better , the decisions in the relevant period and the ways they were made , as well as the outcome of the war , would have been significantly better , '' the report said .
2007_05_01_1844213	11	But it also made clear that '' the prime minister bears supreme and comprehensive responsibility for the decisions of his government and the operations of the army . ''
2007_05_01_1844213	12	After militants from Hezbollah crossed into Israel last July , killing three Israeli soldiers and seizing two others , Israel retaliated with a ground and aerial assault , vowing to destroy Hezbollah 's military infrastructure .
2007_05_01_1844213	13	Hezbollah launched thousands of rockets at northern Israel , while Israel pounded southern Lebanon .
2007_05_01_1844213	14	The fighting lasted for 34 days , and Hezbollah was widely portrayed as surviving the conflict relatively intact .
2007_05_01_1844213	15	The commission , led by a retired judge , Eliyahu Winograd , was appointed by the Olmert government , but it pulled few punches . ''
2007_05_01_1844213	16	Only one sentence is missing '' about Mr. Olmert , said Amnon Abramovitch , a respected commentator on Israel 's Channel 2 television -- that '' this being the case , he can not continue in his post . ''
2007_05_01_1844213	17	Despite Mr. Olmert 's vow to continue in office , a cabinet minister who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the political delicacy of the matter said , '' This is n't over yet . ''
2007_05_01_1844213	18	With an antigovernment demonstration scheduled for Thursday , the minister said , '' the next 48 hours will be crucial . ''
2007_05_01_1844213	19	He said he expected , since no one in the government wanted new elections , that Mr. Olmert would try to use the next three months '' to see if he can correct matters , '' with the help of a new finance minister and a new defense minister -- perhaps Ehud Barak , the former prime minister , or Ami Ayalon , a former head of the Shin Bet security service , either of whom seems able to defeat Mr. Peretz next month for the Labor Party leadership .
2007_05_01_1844213	20	Israel 's finance minister , Abraham Hirchson , is temporarily on leave as the police investigate allegations of embezzlement from before he joined the government , only one of several continuing inquiries into the government and Mr. Olmert .
2007_05_01_1844213	21	Miri Eisin , Mr. Olmert 's spokeswoman , noted that the prime minister and the army had already begun reforms in the defense structure and in military training and procedures .
2007_05_01_1844213	22	Mr. Olmert 's coalition government of the center and left has a large majority in Parliament , and if he were replaced , it would most likely be an internal move , without new elections .
2007_05_01_1844213	23	Yossi Klein Halevi , a senior fellow at the Shalem Center , a conservative research institute here , said that '' given historical precedent , no government has been able to survive the disillusionment of the Israeli people . ''
2007_05_01_1844213	24	Whatever option he chooses short of resignation is futile , '' he said .
2007_05_01_1844213	25	Israelis have a grudging respect for Mr. Olmert for deciding to go to war , which they supported , Mr. Halevi said . ''
2007_05_01_1844213	26	But they knew the war was a failure , '' he added . ''
2007_05_01_1844213	27	The question is why we did n't win the war .
2007_05_01_1844213	28	It 's a question of competence . ''
2007_05_01_1844213	29	The use of the word '' severe '' by the commission , he said , will be taken by the Israeli public as '' an implicit call for Olmert to resign . ''
2007_05_01_1844213	30	Arye Carmon , the president of the Israel Democracy Institute , a liberal research organization , said that the commission had gone too far into politics , and that its conclusions may push the government '' into preparing for the last war , not the next one . '' ''
2007_05_01_1844213	31	Unfortunately , '' he said , '' Israeli democracy has been caught up in a culture of investigating committees .
2007_05_01_1844213	32	It leaves the public passive and ignites another ill phenomenon -- a terrible deterioration of public trust in public institutions . ''
2007_05_01_1844213	33	Mr. Carmon doubted there would be a large political outcry , in part because of the lack of clear alternatives to Mr. Olmert as prime minister and a reluctance to reward the political right wing .
2007_05_01_1844213	34	Asher Arian , a senior fellow at the Israel Democracy Institute and a political scientist with the Graduate Center of the City University of New York , said the report also laid blame on the cabinet and the system , and therefore may have '' pulled its punches '' with '' too broad an indictment . ''
2007_05_01_1844213	35	The report must be seen in the context of tough Israeli politics , Mr. Arian said . ''
2007_05_01_1844213	36	No one wants elections now , and that gives Olmert his real safety net , '' he said .
2007_05_01_1844213	37	In three months , when the next part of the report comes out , it will seem even more like Monday morning quarterbacking , Mr. Arian said , '' and Olmert may be in negotiations with the Palestinians . ''
2007_05_01_1844213	38	He , like others , noted that the foreign minister , Tzipi Livni , had not been mentioned in this first report , even though she is also a deputy prime minister .
2007_05_01_1844213	39	She has complained that Mr. Olmert consulted little with others in the early days of the war ; he has complained that she was a reluctant bystander and was not fully supportive .
2007_05_01_1844213	40	While Ms. Livni did not criticize Mr. Olmert openly during the war , she and her staff have made it clear since then that she favored an early halt to the fighting , to move toward a quicker diplomatic resolution .
2007_05_01_1844213	41	Ms. Livni is the most likely beneficiary if Mr. Olmert does resign or if their party , Kadima , forces him out , but Mr. Arian said that she must not be seen to be '' raising a knife . ''
2007_05_01_1844213	42	Some in Kadima would rather change prime ministers after the second part of the report comes out , to try to have a fresher start .
2007_05_01_1844213	43	The report also lambasted the defense minister , Mr. Peretz , a former trade union leader , for what it called his inexperience and lack of curiosity , his lack of strategic vision and his failure to press General Halutz and the army for options , details and the nature of its own internal debate .
2007_05_01_1844213	44	Still , the report concluded by describing the failures of previous governments and commanders to keep the army in a state of readiness , in part because of an assumption that '' Israel is beyond the era of wars '' and could rely on deterrence alone . ''
2007_05_01_1844213	45	The conclusion was that the main challenge facing the land forces would be low-intensity asymmetrical conflicts , '' the report said , like the counterinsurgency tactics used in the Palestinian territories .
2007_05_01_1844213	46	The military '' was not ready for this war , '' it said .
2007_05_01_1844213	47	It also recommended a better use of the National Security Council , a better system for crisis management in the prime minister 's office and the '' full incorporation '' of the Foreign Ministry '' in security decisions with political and diplomatic aspects . ''
2007_05_01_1844214	0	A federal judge ruled yesterday that the pharmaceutical industry could continue to use computerized data showing which doctors are prescribing what drugs .
2007_05_01_1844214	1	Judge Paul Barbadoro of United States District Court struck down a New Hampshire law that prohibited the purchase and resale of the data for use by the drug makers .
2007_05_01_1844214	2	Judge Barbadoro , ruling in Concord , N.H. , said that the law violated the First Amendment by restricting commercial speech . ''
2007_05_01_1844214	3	Ordinarily , states should be given wide latitude to choose among rational alternatives when they act to benefit the public interest , '' Judge Barbadoro wrote in his 54-page ruling . ''
2007_05_01_1844214	4	However , when states adopt speech restrictions as their method , courts must subject their efforts to closer scrutiny . ''
2007_05_01_1844214	5	The ruling was a victory for IMS Health , the leading purveyor of pharmaceutical prescribing data , as well as a competitor , Verispan .
2007_05_01_1844214	6	Both companies sued last year to have the New Hampshire law stricken , arguing that prohibitions on the sale of the information violated their constitutional rights .
2007_05_01_1844214	7	The decision could have implications in other states considering similar legislation .
2007_05_01_1844214	8	According to the National Conference of State Legislatures , several states were considering such proposals this year .
2007_05_01_1844214	9	The legislation had been urged by doctors who objected to the sharing of their prescribing patterns .
2007_05_01_1844214	10	The New Hampshire law , which was enacted last year and took effect in July , was the first state law to specifically prohibit the sale or transfer of information identifying doctors for commercial purposes .
2007_05_01_1844214	11	Representative Cindy Rosenwald , the New Hampshire legislator who sponsored the law , expressed disappointment yesterday in the ruling , which issued a permanent injunction against enforcement of the law . ''
2007_05_01_1844214	12	I feel that corporate interests took precedent over the needs of people in New Hampshire , '' she said . ''
2007_05_01_1844214	13	I think it 's like having a drug rep peering over a doctor 's shoulder when he is writing a prescription . ''
2007_05_01_1844214	14	But she added that the issue had gained momentum . ''
2007_05_01_1844214	15	I do n't think this issue is going to go away . ''
2007_05_01_1844214	16	An assistant attorney general in New Hampshire , Richard Head , said the state was deciding whether to appeal the decision . ''
2007_05_01_1844214	17	We are going to review the court 's decision and consider various alternatives , '' he said .
2007_05_01_1844214	18	An IMS vice president , Randolph B. Frankel , applauded the ruling last night , saying it '' points to the fact that states have a variety of alternatives to manage quality and cost without impacting free speech . '' ''
2007_05_01_1844214	19	And I believe , '' Mr. Frankel said , '' that other states will look to this decision as a basis for framing where they go in terms of their own legislative activities . ''
2007_05_01_1844214	20	The sale of prescription data , in which patient identification is omitted , has become a lucrative industry .
2007_05_01_1844214	21	The data is purchased from pharmacy chains and the companies that manage drug benefits for employers , and it shows precisely how many prescriptions individual doctors have written for specific drugs .
2007_05_01_1844214	22	Companies like IMS and Verispan sell the data to pharmaceutical companies , which use it to tailor their marketing plans to specific doctors .
2007_05_01_1844214	23	Sales representatives who visit doctors ' offices carry laptop computers with detailed reports on each doctor .
2007_05_01_1844214	24	The American College of Physicians has asked that the American Medical Association prohibit the release or sale of doctors ' prescribing information .
2007_05_01_1844214	25	Last year , the A.M.A. established a registry of doctors who could '' opt out '' of having their prescription data shared with representatives .
2007_05_01_1844214	26	That was part of a voluntary arrangement the A.M.A. reached with the data companies .
2007_05_01_1844214	27	About 7,000 of the 850,000 doctors in the United States have opted out .
2007_05_01_1844215	0	Business 2.0 , the technology-aware magazine published by Time Inc. , periodically reminds readers of the importance of backing up computer files .
2007_05_01_1844215	1	A 2003 article likened backups to flossing -- everyone knows it 's important , but few devote enough thought or energy to it .
2007_05_01_1844215	2	Last week , Business 2.0 got caught forgetting to floss .
2007_05_01_1844215	3	On the night of Monday , April 23 , the magazine 's editorial system crashed , wiping out all the work that had been done for its June issue .
2007_05_01_1844215	4	The backup server failed to back up .
2007_05_01_1844215	5	Good thing the magazine , based in San Francisco , is a monthly . ''
2007_05_01_1844215	6	If it had happened a week later , we would have been in trouble , '' said Josh Quittner , the editor .
2007_05_01_1844215	7	But all is well , he said , and the magazine will go to press on schedule next week .
2007_05_01_1844215	8	The recovery was made much easier , paradoxically , by a bane of modern business , litigation -- or at least the fear of it . ''
2007_05_01_1844215	9	The text had all been copy-edited and sent off to the lawyers , so it had been saved as e-mail , '' Mr. Quittner said .
2007_05_01_1844215	10	But the artwork , the page layouts , were truly gone , he said , and '' our heroic art department had to rebuild all the art assets . ''
2007_05_01_1844215	11	He said they had caught up by Thursday .
2007_05_01_1844215	12	The night of the crash , Mr. Quittner said , '' our tech guy was here until 4 o'clock in the morning , but the patient died . ''
2007_05_01_1844215	13	Until then , the magazine had never had to rely on its backup server , he said , so no one had noticed that its programming was either obsolete or dysfunctional , or both .
2007_05_01_1844215	14	Just last November , the magazine had listed off-site backup as being among '' the usual precautions . ''
2007_05_01_1844215	15	Mr. Quittner said that Time Inc. , a division of Time Warner , now has Business 2.0 linked to a more sophisticated -- and , presumably , more frequently checked -- backup server in New York , '' so if we crash here , the worst that would happen is we would lose a half-hour 's worth of work . ''
2007_05_01_1844215	16	Business 2.0 has drawn attention for skewering companies , including , occasionally , other magazines , in its annual list of the '' 101 Dumbest Moments in Business . ''
2007_05_01_1844215	17	So is Business 2.0 now a candidate for its own list ? ''
2007_05_01_1844215	18	I think we would be if we did n't make it to press , but we 've done far dumber things than this , '' Mr. Quittner said . ''
2007_05_01_1844215	19	It could have been a lot worse . ''
2007_05_01_1844217	0	In its first study of how an American company treats its workers , Human Rights Watch asserted yesterday that Wal-Mart 's aggressive efforts to keep out labor unions often violated federal law and infringed on its workers ' rights .
2007_05_01_1844217	1	Human Rights Watch , which typically focuses on rights violations in Burundi , North Korea or other foreign countries , said that when Wal-Mart stores faced unionization drives , the company often broke the law by , for example , eavesdropping on workers , training surveillance cameras on them and firing those who favored unions . ''
2007_05_01_1844217	2	While many American companies use weak U.S. laws to stop workers from organizing , the retail giant stands out for the sheer magnitude and aggressiveness of its anti-union apparatus , '' the human rights group wrote .
2007_05_01_1844217	3	Wal-Mart Stores has more than 1.3 million workers at its nearly 4,000 stores in the United States , and none of its workers belong to a union .
2007_05_01_1844217	4	Wal-Mart , in response , vigorously defended its labor practices .
2007_05_01_1844217	5	David Tovar , a Wal-Mart spokesman , said that Wal-Mart provided an environment for open communications and gave its employees '' every opportunity to express their ideas , comments and concerns . '' ''
2007_05_01_1844217	6	It is because of our efforts to foster such an environment that our associates have repeatedly rejected unionization attempts , '' he said .
2007_05_01_1844217	7	Mr. Tovar said the report used unsubstantiated accusations from as long as seven years ago .
2007_05_01_1844217	8	Two of the five organizing drives that the 219-page report examined took place in 2005 , while the other three campaigns took place more than five years ago . ''
2007_05_01_1844217	9	Contrary to the allegations in this report , Wal-Mart respects our associates ' right to a free and fair unionization vote , '' Mr. Tovar said . ''
2007_05_01_1844217	10	We remain committed to compliance with U.S. laws regarding workers ' right to unionize . ''
2007_05_01_1844217	11	Carol Pier , a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch and author of the Wal-Mart report , said her organization decided to look specifically at Wal-Mart because of concerns about violations of labor laws . ''
2007_05_01_1844217	12	When the largest private employer in the United States seems to be able to violate U.S. labor law with virtual impunity , that 's a very serious cause for concern , both with respect to its impact on its employees , but also on the conduct by other employers in the United States , '' Ms. Pier said in a telephone interview .
2007_05_01_1844217	13	Wal-Mart called the study '' pro-union . ''
2007_05_01_1844217	14	Ms. Pier said that only $ 50 of her organization 's $ 33 million budget came from labor unions .
2007_05_01_1844217	15	Over the last few years , the main union for retail workers , the United Food and Commercial Workers , has suspended efforts to organize any Wal-Mart stores in the United States , largely because Wal-Mart 's counteroffensive makes that so difficult , union officials said .
2007_05_01_1844217	16	Moreover , union officials said they could put more pressure on Wal-Mart by mounting a sophisticated publicity campaign to embarrass it over its wages , benefits and overall treatment of its employees .
2007_05_01_1844217	17	For the most part , the unionization drives described in the report , at Wal-Marts in Kingman , Ariz. ; Aiken , S.C. ; New Castle , Pa. ; and Loveland and Greeley , Colo. , grew out of discontent over wages and health benefits .
2007_05_01_1844217	18	Wal-Mart says it has increased wages , to an average of $ 10.51 an hour for full-time workers , and has improved its health insurance , creating a plan with premiums of $ 23 a month anywhere in the country . ''
2007_05_01_1844217	19	People want to work at Wal-Mart because we offer competitive wages , affordable health benefits and real career opportunities , '' Mr. Tovar said .
2007_05_01_1844217	20	But critics say that even with the increase in wages , many Wal-Mart workers still live below the poverty line and its low-premium health plan remains unaffordable to many workers because the deductibles often run to $ 3,000 a family .
2007_05_01_1844217	21	Human Right Watch issued a report in 2000 saying that America 's labor laws and labor law enforcement were so weak that they made it difficult for workers to unionize and violate international labor standards .
2007_05_01_1844217	22	The report issued yesterday asserted that Wal-Mart took advantage of those weak laws to push its workers into opposing unions , by , for example , ordering them to attend meetings with anti-union speakers and videos . ''
2007_05_01_1844217	23	Wal-Mart assets that respect for the individual is one of the core values that have made us into the company we are today , '' the report said . ''
2007_05_01_1844217	24	Wal-Mart 's systematic interference with individual workers ' right to freedom of association flies in the face of this professed core value . ''
2007_05_01_1844217	25	The report found that unions and workers had brought 292 cases against Wal-Mart , with the National Labor Relations Board finding that 101 cases had merit .
2007_05_01_1844217	26	Those cases were consolidated into 39 complaints , with 17 administrative law judges ruling that Wal-Mart had violated labor laws .
2007_05_01_1844217	27	The labor board reversed two of those decisions .
2007_05_01_1844219	0	United States Special Forces said they killed more than 130 Taliban in two recent days of heavy fighting in a valley in western Afghanistan , but hundreds of angry villagers protested in nearby Shindand on Monday , saying dozens of civilians had been killed when the Americans called in airstrikes .
2007_05_01_1844219	1	The protesters sacked and burned government buildings , said Noor Khan Nekzad , a spokesman for the provincial police .
2007_05_01_1844219	2	He said none of the demonstrators were injured , but news reports said a number of protesters were hurt as the police and the army moved in to subdue the crowd .
2007_05_01_1844219	3	The American military said that the fighting against the Taliban occurred Friday and Sunday in the Zerkoh Valley , near the Iranian border about 30 miles south of the city of Herat , and that the Special Forces called in airstrikes on at least two occasions .
2007_05_01_1844219	4	An American soldier was killed in the fighting on Friday , the military said , but there were no other reported casualties on the coalition side .
2007_05_01_1844219	5	Forty-nine Taliban fighters , including two leaders of the group , were killed in the first bombardment on Friday , and 87 militants were killed in bombing during a second battle on Sunday that raged for 14 hours , the military said in a statement from the United States-led coalition headquarters at the Bagram air base .
2007_05_01_1844219	6	But the local residents said that civilians were killed in the bombardment and that some drowned in the river as they fled , according to a local member of Parliament , Maulavi Gul Ahmad .
2007_05_01_1844219	7	News agencies reported that demonstrators said women and children were among the dead .
2007_05_01_1844219	8	Mr. Ahmad condemned the bombing and said that the fighting angered local residents because the Americans raided their houses at night . ''
2007_05_01_1844219	9	They should not do that , '' he said in a telephone interview . ''
2007_05_01_1844219	10	The number that they claim -- that 130 Taliban were killed -- is totally wrong .
2007_05_01_1844219	11	There are no Taliban there . ''
2007_05_01_1844219	12	Raiding houses touches a nerve in Afghanistan , especially in conservative tribal areas , because the local custom dictates that men who are not family members can not enter the parts of homes where the women stay .
2007_05_01_1844219	13	Such raids were upsetting local sensibilities so much several years ago that the American forces made an agreement with the Afghan government that they would not raid houses without the presence of Afghan elders or the police .
2007_05_01_1844219	14	The Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission says that the agreement is still in effect , but that American troops do not always adhere to it .
2007_05_01_1844219	15	But an Afghan military official , who asked not to be identified , presented a different version of events from that of Mr. Ahmad .
2007_05_01_1844219	16	He said that the Special Forces had run into trouble on Friday , when they were surrounded by insurgents , and that they requested support from the Afghan National Army .
2007_05_01_1844219	17	Afghan Army and police officials denied any involvement in the fighting .
2007_05_01_1844219	18	The province of Herat , where the fighting occurred , is usually quiet , but the Zerkoh Valley is populated by ethnic Pashtuns and shares a border with provinces where there are many insurgents .
2007_05_01_1844219	19	A Vow to Cooperate ANKARA , Turkey , April 30 ( Reuters ) -- The president of Pakistan , Gen. Pervez Musharraf , and President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan vowed Monday to work together to fight terrorism and improve bilateral ties after a war of words over the Taliban insurgency .
2007_05_01_1844219	20	For the past year , the United States has pressed Mr. Karzai and General Musharraf to cooperate , but relations have remained strained .
2007_05_01_1844219	21	In a joint statement after talks held in Turkey , the leaders said they agreed to deny sanctuary , training and financing to terrorists .
2007_05_01_1844219	22	In an interview with NTV of Turkey , General Musharraf said no details had been discussed yet .
2007_05_01_1844219	23	Afghanistan has said the Taliban are being run from Pakistan , which Islamabad denies .
2007_05_01_1844219	24	Pakistan maintains that the roots of the insurgency lie in Afghanistan and in problems with Mr. Karzai 's government .
2007_05_01_1844220	0	Turkey 's secular political leaders promised Monday to mount a unified challenge to Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan in what are likely to be early national elections .
2007_05_01_1844220	1	The country 's financial markets , meanwhile , dropped sharply .
2007_05_01_1844220	2	Turkey has slid into a political confrontation between its secular establishment , backed by its powerful military , and a new group of political modernizers led by Mr. Erdogan , whose roots are in political Islam .
2007_05_01_1844220	3	The standoff started Friday , when secular political parties appealed to the country 's highest court to block Mr. Erdogan 's choice for president , a close political ally , Abdullah Gul .
2007_05_01_1844220	4	Later that night , the military , which has ousted four elected governments since 1960 , issued a stern warning .
2007_05_01_1844220	5	The presidency is the highest secular post in the country , and the prospect of a candidate whose background is in political Islam occupying it is deeply disturbing to some Turks .
2007_05_01_1844220	6	But the specter of a military coup is also alarming , a concern that Turkey 's financial markets registered Monday .
2007_05_01_1844220	7	The Turkish lira fell 2.4 percent , the most in seven months , Bloomberg News reported .
2007_05_01_1844220	8	The stock market dropped 4 percent , erasing almost $ 8 billion in value .
2007_05_01_1844220	9	Deniz Baykal , leader of the largest secular party , the Republican People 's Party , called for secular parties to join together to mount a unified front to compete with Mr. Erdogan . ''
2007_05_01_1844220	10	I see this as a necessity for all powers that believe in Ataturk 's principles and the unity of the republic , '' he said -- referring to Mustafa Kemal Ataturk , the visionary who founded the Turkish state in 1923 -- at a news conference that was broadcast on television . ''
2007_05_01_1844220	11	The remedy is the unification of all powers that wish to eliminate this danger . ''
2007_05_01_1844220	12	But Turkey 's secular political parties are fractured and weak , and it remains to be seen whether they are up to the task of uniting to compete with Mr. Erdogan 's broadly popular Justice and Development Party .
2007_05_01_1844220	13	Erkan Mumcu , leader of another secular party , Motherland , said in a press conference of his own that the only way to avoid political confrontation was for Mr. Erdogan to back down on Mr. Gul 's candidacy .
2007_05_01_1844220	14	The constitutional court deliberated over the case on Monday , and is expected to hand down a ruling on Tuesday or Wednesday .
2007_05_01_1844220	15	If the court rules in favor of the secular parties , it is expected that Mr. Erdogan will call for early elections .
2007_05_01_1844220	16	Voting is currently scheduled for the fall .
2007_05_01_1844220	17	It is unclear whether the military will intervene , a possibility that already is being condemned by international observers , including the European Union that Turkey has worked so hard to join .
2007_05_01_1844220	18	In Washington on Monday , Sean McCormack , the State Department spokesman , said , '' We have real confidence in Turkey 's democracy and we have confidence in their constitutional processes and that all the parties involved in the election of the new Turkish president will abide by those constitutional processes . ''
2007_05_01_1844220	19	Mr. Erdogan , in a speech to the nation on Monday night , avoided mentioning the political troubles , instead appealing for Turks to come together . ''
2007_05_01_1844220	20	Turkey needs this togetherness , this unity , this love that has been freed of prejudices , '' he said .

2007_05_01_1844222	0	A senior commander in the American military 's main detention center here testified Monday at a military hearing that his predecessor , Lt. Col. William H. Steele , gave computer programs and other gifts to the daughter of a high-value detainee .
2007_05_01_1844222	1	The commander , Lt. Col. Quentin Crank , whose military police unit took over for Colonel Steele 's at Camp Cropper in October 2006 , said the gifts , which would be a breach of military law and Iraqi cultural norms , were given after Colonel Steele had moved to another assignment in Iraq .
2007_05_01_1844222	2	The detainee was said to be outraged by the personal contact with his daughter , telling American officials that Colonel Steele was trying to supplant his role as father .
2007_05_01_1844222	3	A computer forensics expert testified that an IBM laptop recovered during the investigation contained classified material , 37 adult pornographic videos , 122 adult pornographic images and an e-mail message to an undisclosed person that '' appeared to be adulterous in nature . ''
2007_05_01_1844222	4	A second laptop , a Dell , contained the text of a secret document , the investigator said .
2007_05_01_1844222	5	The testimony once again cast the ethical conduct of American jailers in Iraq in an unfavorable light , even as the military sets in motion plans to expand its detention facilities to make room for the rapidly growing ranks of prisoners captured during the new security plan .
2007_05_01_1844222	6	The hearing is to weigh the evidence against Colonel Steele , 51 , a married reservist from Prince George , Va. , who has had prior scrapes with the law .
2007_05_01_1844222	7	In November 1993 , he was charged with aggravated child abuse and resisting an officer with violence , both felonies , according to Hernando County , Fla. , court records .
2007_05_01_1844222	8	A state prosecutor accused Colonel Steele , a former Hernando County sheriff 's deputy , of physically and verbally abusing his 11-year-old stepson for homework errors , and of padlocking the family 's refrigerator and food cabinets to prevent the boy from eating , according to court records .
2007_05_01_1844222	9	The charges were dropped when Colonel Steele , an Army reservist at the time , agreed to give up custody of the boy .
2007_05_01_1844222	10	Colonel 's Steele 's wife , Judith , did not return phone calls and e-mail messages seeking comment .
2007_05_01_1844222	11	Colonel Steele has been accused of nine violations of military law , including '' aiding the enemy , '' related to the allegation that he passed an unmonitored cellphone to detainees .
2007_05_01_1844222	12	He is also accused of mishandling classified information and government funds , fraternizing with the daughter of a detainee , engaging in an inappropriate relationship with an interpreter and possessing pornography .
2007_05_01_1844222	13	The allegations cover Oct. 1 , 2005 , to Feb. 22 , 2007 .
2007_05_01_1844222	14	The officer overseeing the hearing , Col. Elizabeth Fleming , will determine if the evidence warrants a court-martial , which would have to be approved by Lt. Gen. Raymond T. Odierno , commander of daily operations in Iraq .
2007_05_01_1844222	15	The most serious of the nine allegations , '' aiding the enemy , '' carries a potential death sentence , though a military liaison with the court said that life in prison would be more likely if Colonel Steele were found guilty .
2007_05_01_1844222	16	Some details of the accusations were handled in closed sessions because they involved classified evidence .
2007_05_01_1844222	17	Many of the allegations were raised in vague terms in the public sessions .
2007_05_01_1844222	18	The '' aiding the enemy '' accusation was raised obliquely , when Colonel Crank explained how every detainee phone call is supposed to be listened to and logged by an interpreter and an American soldier .
2007_05_01_1844222	19	Colonel Steele 's supposed mishandling of classified information was also described opaquely , with Colonel Crank saying that he saw Colonel Steele downloading more than 20 CD-ROMs from a third government laptop when they worked together during the transfer of command .
2007_05_01_1844222	20	It was not established that the information he downloaded was classified .
2007_05_01_1844222	21	But mainly , on the first day of what is expected to be at least a two-day hearing , the government 's lawyers and Colonel Steele 's military-appointed defenders focused on the accusations that the former commander mishandled government finances and information and that he had improper relations with women he encountered as the prison 's commanding officer .
2007_05_01_1844222	22	Colonel Crank , commander of the 494th Military Police unit , said Colonel Steele returned to the prison to give several items to the high-value detainee 's daughter during visiting hours .
2007_05_01_1844222	23	The current operations officer for Colonel Crank 's unit testified that Colonel Steele called ahead to say that he would be coming to deliver '' college paperwork '' to the woman .
2007_05_01_1844222	24	Colonel Crank said that when Colonel Steele arrived , he gave the woman a box with computer programs and papers , along with blueprints , '' in a room away from everybody else . ''
2007_05_01_1844222	25	He added that a photo had been taken .

2007_05_01_1844224	1	GOV. JON S. CORZINE , apologizing to the people of New Jersey , 18 days after he was injured in a traffic accident in which he was not wearing a seat belt and was being driven at more than 91 miles per hour .
2007_05_01_1844227	0	Alibaba.com , China 's leading e-commerce company , is planning to go public later this year in what could be the biggest initial public offering ever for a Chinese Internet company , according to people briefed on the deal .
2007_05_01_1844227	1	Alibaba.com , which is controlled by the Alibaba Group and partly owned by Yahoo , could raise $ 1 billion , making the stock offering bigger than those of other high-flying Chinese Internet companies in recent years , including Baidu.com , the Chinese Internet search engine , and Tencent.com , which runs the popular QQ instant messaging service .
2007_05_01_1844227	2	Three Wall Street investment banks , Goldman Sachs , Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank , are advising Alibaba on the public offering , which would involve only the Alibaba Group 's biggest unit , Alibaba.com , a business-to-business site that helps entrepreneurs , suppliers and businesses from around the world find one another and buy and sell goods .
2007_05_01_1844227	3	The offering could hatch another huge public Internet company in China , which already has more than 137 million Internet users , second only to the United States .
2007_05_01_1844227	4	The shares are expected to be offered overseas , most likely in Hong Kong or New York .
2007_05_01_1844227	5	Google , Yahoo , eBay , MySpace and other Internet giants are all trying to break into the fast-growing China market .
2007_05_01_1844227	6	But home-grown Internet players like Baidu , NetEase , Alibaba and Alibaba 's Taobao auction site have largely dominated their Western rivals .
2007_05_01_1844227	7	In 2005 , Yahoo paid $ 1 billion in cash for a 40 percent share of Alibaba and handed its China operations over to the Alibaba Group and its chairman and chief executive , Jack Ma , a former English teacher from Hangzhou , where Alibaba is based .
2007_05_01_1844227	8	At that time , the Alibaba Group was valued at about $ 4 billion .
2007_05_01_1844227	9	Now , people who have been briefed on the public offering say that Alibaba.com alone could be valued at more than $ 4 billion when it goes public .
2007_05_01_1844227	10	Other divisions of the Alibaba Group , like its online marketplace , Taobao.com , and the Yahoo China operations , will not be included in the stock offering .
2007_05_01_1844227	11	Those units will remain part of the privately controlled Alibaba Group .
2007_05_01_1844227	12	A spokesman for Alibaba declined to comment Monday .
2007_05_01_1844227	13	Spokesmen for Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley also declined to comment .
2007_05_01_1844227	14	A spokesman for Deutsche Bank could not be reached late Monday .
2007_05_01_1844228	0	Newspaper sales continue a steep slide nationally , figures released Monday show , but two New York City tabloids continued to buck the trend , posting the largest gains among major papers .
2007_05_01_1844228	1	The industry as a whole reported a 2.1 percent drop in weekday circulation , and 3.1 percent on Sundays , in the six months ended March 31 , compared with the period a year earlier .
2007_05_01_1844228	2	The figures , compiled by the Audit Bureau of Circulations but not yet audited , reflect 745 of the nation 's more than 1,400 daily newspapers .
2007_05_01_1844228	3	The figures follow first-quarter reports for the nation 's major newspaper companies that showed falling earnings , declines in advertising and plans for continued staff cuts , heightening fears about the future of newspapers .
2007_05_01_1844228	4	Circulation figures have dropped gradually for two decades , beginning in the 1980s , but since 2004 , the decline has picked up speed as readers and advertisers have migrated to the Internet .
2007_05_01_1844228	5	But The New York Post , and its rival , The Daily News , defied the industry 's gravity .
2007_05_01_1844228	6	Circulation at The Post jumped 7.6 percent on weekdays and 6.2 percent on Sundays , and at The News it rose 1.4 percent on weekdays , but slipped 2.5 percent on Sundays .
2007_05_01_1844228	7	Sales have held fairly steady in recent years at the nation 's three largest-circulation newspapers , USA Today ( more than 2.2 million ) , The Wall Street Journal ( more than 2 million ) and The New York Times ( more than 1.1 million ) .
2007_05_01_1844228	8	In the most recent period , USA Today and The Journal , which do not print Sunday issues , posted fractional gains , while The Times 's circulation dropped 1.9 percent on weekdays and 3.4 percent on Sundays .
2007_05_01_1844228	9	The Los Angeles Times , roiled by internal dissension , leadership turnover and a recent deal by its owner , the Tribune Company , to take the company private , lost 4.2 percent of its weekday sales , and 4.7 percent on Sundays .
2007_05_01_1844228	10	The Times 's weekday circulation averaged 815,000 , almost 300,000 below where it stood seven years earlier .
2007_05_01_1844228	11	In New York City , The Daily News and The Post have long sparred with promotions , games and articles belittling each other , in a contest that often seems as much a reflection of their executives ' egos as any business strategy .
2007_05_01_1844228	12	As of yesterday , the newsstand price of The Post rose to 50 cents , while The News dropped its weekday price from 50 cents to 25 cents for at least a week .
2007_05_01_1844228	13	Last year , The Post , owned by Rupert Murdoch 's News Corporation , overtook The News in weekday circulation for the first time in memory , and it continued to hold a slim lead in yesterday 's report , 725,000 to 718,000 .
2007_05_01_1844228	14	But The News , owned by Mortimer Zuckerman , remains far ahead in Sunday sales , 776,000 to 439,000 , and in advertising .
2007_05_01_1844228	15	In interviews , executives at each paper sought to poke holes in the other 's figures .
2007_05_01_1844228	16	The editor of The Post , Col Allan , pointed to a large increase in Daily News copies paid for by someone other than readers , including those bought by hotels for guests , or advertisers for promotional giveaways . ''
2007_05_01_1844228	17	The Daily News is using third-party sales to cover up the collapse of their paid circulation , '' he said .
2007_05_01_1844228	18	The chief executive of The Daily News , Marc Z. Kramer , cited a recent Scarborough Research report that far more people read his paper , and he disparaged The Post 's campaign to bolster circulation in other parts of the country as a failed strategy .
2007_05_01_1844228	19	Neither tabloid 's financial information is public ; The News is privately held and the News Corporation does not break out figures for The Post .
2007_05_01_1844228	20	But analysts believe The News turns a small profit , while The Post loses tens of millions of dollars a year .
2007_05_01_1844229	0	The Senate began debate on Monday on a bill that could fundamentally change the way the Food and Drug Administration operates by giving it more power and money to ensure that drugs are as safe as advertised .
2007_05_01_1844229	1	The measure , which has bipartisan support , would renew and increase the fees paid by regulated drug companies .
2007_05_01_1844229	2	Such fees , which are to expire in September , are a significant part of the agency budget .
2007_05_01_1844229	3	If they are not renewed , it is likely that workers will be laid off .
2007_05_01_1844229	4	The bill would provide more money to track the safety of drugs after they have reached consumers and more authority to force drug manufacturers to complete promised safety studies .
2007_05_01_1844229	5	It would also renew requirements and incentives for pharmaceutical companies to ensure that their products are safe for children . ''
2007_05_01_1844229	6	This is the most important legislation for F.D.A. in at least 10 years and , probably , forever on issues of drug safety , '' said Dr. Mark B. McClellan , a former food and drug commissioner appointed by Mr. Bush .
2007_05_01_1844229	7	Dr. David A. Kessler , a commissioner in the Clinton administration , said , '' This is a pivotal moment in F.D.A. 's history , as important as 1938 or 1962 , when Congress gave the agency its fundamental responsibilities . ''
2007_05_01_1844229	8	Despite a widening scandal about the safety of imported food , the bill as written would do little to change the oversight of the safety of the food supply .
2007_05_01_1844229	9	Instead , the measure represents years of concern about the safety of drugs that began with studies showing that antidepressants seemed to cause suicidal tendencies in a small number of children and teen-agers .
2007_05_01_1844229	10	The agency suppressed an initial report on the problem , only to acknowledge later that it was real .
2007_05_01_1844229	11	Concerns about the basic competence of the agency to protect public health grew in September 2004 , when Merck withdrew a pain pill , Vioxx , after a study showed that it increased the risk of heart attacks .
2007_05_01_1844229	12	Months later , a safety official from agency told a Senate panel that the agency was '' virtually incapable '' of protecting the public from unsafe drugs .
2007_05_01_1844229	13	Senator Edward M. Kennedy , the Democrat from Massachusetts who is chairman of the Senate Health , Education , Labor and Pensions Committee , is the principal sponsor of the bill .
2007_05_01_1844229	14	It has the strong support of Senator Michael B. Enzi , the Wyoming Republican who is the ranking minority member on the panel .
2007_05_01_1844229	15	The committee passed the bill , 15 to 6 vote , but details about what Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Enzi would introduce on the Senate floor were a subject of furious speculation throughout much of Monday as drug and biotechnology lobbyists circulated updates to executives of drug companies .
2007_05_01_1844229	16	The speculation centered on whether the senators would include proposals to speed the approval of copycat versions of biologics , drugs like insulin and growth hormone that are made by cells in processes that are more difficult to control than the chemical mixing used to make most pharmaceuticals .
2007_05_01_1844229	17	In the end , the senators decided against including that provision .
2007_05_01_1844229	18	The biotechnology industry opposed it , and the makers of generic drugs supported it .
2007_05_01_1844229	19	Generic biologics legislation is to be introduced separately .
2007_05_01_1844229	20	Nonetheless , the Kennedy-Enzi bill is dizzyingly complex and includes an alphabet soup of provisions that finance and define many basic operations of the agency .
2007_05_01_1844229	21	The most important of those allows faster consideration of applications for drug approvals in return for payments from manufacturers .
2007_05_01_1844229	22	The previous action on the fees expires in September .
2007_05_01_1844229	23	If it is not renewed , the agency would lose $ 320 million of its $ 1.5 billion budget .
2007_05_01_1844229	24	Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Enzi have proposed increasing the fees by more than $ 80 million .
2007_05_01_1844229	25	The bill would direct the agency to spend much of the additional money on combing through millions of health records collected by insurers to measure what effects popular drugs have had after their approval .
2007_05_01_1844229	26	The agency is now able only to track drug side effects through doctors and patients ' voluntary reports , a system that even top officials agree is incapable of uncovering problems like those with Vioxx .
2007_05_01_1844229	27	The bill also would give the agency for the first time the power to fine on drug makers that fail to carry out promised safety studies .
2007_05_01_1844229	28	Presently , the agency has no power to enforce these pledges , so only a fraction are completed . ''
2007_05_01_1844229	29	The F.D.A should be the gold standard for safety , but its luster has been tarnished in recent years by failure to protect the American people from unsafe drugs , '' Mr. Kennedy said on the Senate floor .
2007_05_01_1844229	30	The House will most likely consider on its own many provisions in the Senate measure , rendering its prospects uncertain .
2007_05_01_1844229	31	Senator Charles E. Grassley , the Iowa Republican who is the ranking minority member of the Senate Finance Committee and who has conducted several investigations of the agency , said in an interview that something had to be done . ''
2007_05_01_1844229	32	We 'll never get another bite at this apple , '' said Mr. Grassley , who intends to offer amendments to reorganize the agency and increase fines for noncompliance with its rules . ''
2007_05_01_1844229	33	But the drug companies are a powerful lobby in this town , '' he said , '' and there 's a big question mark about whether all my work of the last three or four years is going to shine through . ''
2007_05_01_1844231	0	Merger costs and the divestiture of some businesses drove Verizon 's profit down 8.4 percent in the first quarter , but the company continued to have strong growth in wireless and broadband subscriptions .
2007_05_01_1844231	1	Verizon Communications , like its larger rival AT&T , faces challenges as it tries to move beyond being just a phone company to offering services that include mobile , Internet and television in addition to its landlines .
2007_05_01_1844231	2	Those challenges have the companies devising formulas for competing with the avalanche of services being introduced by cable companies .
2007_05_01_1844231	3	Verizon executives said yesterday that a strong point for the company had been customer adoption of its new television and Internet services , which resulted from a nearly $ 20 billion investment by Verizon in a fiber-optic network that can transmit video and data at high speeds . ''
2007_05_01_1844231	4	We 're off to a good start , '' Verizon 's chief financial officer , Doreen A. Toben , said . ''
2007_05_01_1844231	5	We 're very pleased with our results this quarter . ''
2007_05_01_1844231	6	Verizon reported net income of $ 1.5 billion in the quarter , or 51 cents a share , compared with $ 1.63 billion , or 56 cents a share , a year earlier .
2007_05_01_1844231	7	The results include a one-time loss of $ 131 million , or 5 cents a share , related to the nationalization of Venezuela 's main phone company , in which Verizon was a part owner .
2007_05_01_1844231	8	The company also completed the sale of assets in Puerto Rico in the quarter .
2007_05_01_1844231	9	Revenue rose 6.4 percent to $ 22.58 billion , from $ 21.23 billion a year ago .
2007_05_01_1844231	10	Excluding special items and discontinued operations , Verizon would have earned $ 1.56 billion , or 54 cents a share , up from $ 1.36 billion , or 46 cents a share , a year earlier .
2007_05_01_1844231	11	Analysts had expected Verizon to earn 53 cents a share on revenue of $ 22.49 billion , according to a survey by Thomson Financial .
2007_05_01_1844231	12	Verizon shares rose 29 cents , to $ 38.18 . ''
2007_05_01_1844231	13	The quarter was largely in line , '' said Qaisar Hasan , an analyst with Buckingham Research . ''
2007_05_01_1844231	14	Their wireless did a little better than we thought it would , and the wireline a little worse . ''
2007_05_01_1844231	15	Mr. Hasan said he was impressed by early growth that was better than expected of Verizon 's new digital video and data network , called FiOS . ''
2007_05_01_1844231	16	The reception is as good as it could be , '' Ms. Toben said .
2007_05_01_1844231	17	She said the company continued to add regions and expected to achieve the hefty subscriber goals it set for itself as it tries to meet growing consumer demand for access to video programming like that offered by YouTube .
2007_05_01_1844231	18	The continued high cost of introducing FiOS diluted Verizon 's earnings by 11 cents a share , as the company had forecast .
2007_05_01_1844231	19	Company executives said they expect the dilution to amount to 10 cents a share in the second quarter .
2007_05_01_1844231	20	Verizon added 416,000 high-speed connections in the quarter , helping offset its losses in its landline business .
2007_05_01_1844231	21	The company added 141,000 customers to its FiOS TV service , ending the quarter with 348,000 .
2007_05_01_1844231	22	As of last week , AT&T had about 20,000 subscribers to its new television service , U-verse .
2007_05_01_1844231	23	Verizon 's wireless business , which Verizon owns jointly with the Vodafone Group , reported revenue of $ 10.3 billion in the first quarter .
2007_05_01_1844231	24	The unit added 1.7 million wireless subscribers , ending the quarter with 60.7 million subscribers , second only to AT&T Wireless , which serves 62.2 million customers .
2007_05_01_1844231	25	Mr. Hasan said Verizon was also helped by the fact that a larger number of Verizon 's wireless customers in the quarter were monthly subscribers , rather than prepaid customers .
2007_05_01_1844231	26	Adding to its good news , the rate at which Verizon customers canceled subscriptions , known as the churn rate , declined to 1.08 percent from 1.14 percent a year earlier .
2007_05_01_1844231	27	Verizon , like AT&T , has struggled to stem defections from its wireline customers .
2007_05_01_1844231	28	Its wireline business had a 0.1 percent increase in revenue in the quarter , to $ 12.5 billion , with most of that coming from Verizon 's acquisition of MCI last year .
2007_05_01_1844231	29	Adjusting for the acquisition of MCI , wireline revenue declined 1.7 percent .
2007_05_01_1844231	30	Verizon is embroiled in a lawsuit with Vonage Holdings , the Internet phone company , which Verizon has accused of patent violation .
2007_05_01_1844231	31	Last week , a federal appeals court ruled that Vonage could continue to sign up customers while it appealed an earlier ruling that found Vonage to be in violation .
2007_05_01_1844231	32	The court set a June court date to hear Vonage 's appeal , several months sooner than expected .
2007_05_01_1844232	0	They are built in most cases to withstand ferocious winds and , here in California , the heaving of earthquakes .
2007_05_01_1844232	1	But most major highway bridges and overpasses are not fireproof and probably never will be .
2007_05_01_1844232	2	That is because fierce fires like the one that warped steel and collapsed part of a San Francisco Bay Area bridge connector Sunday are considered anomalies in the structural engineering world .
2007_05_01_1844232	3	While car and truck fires occur regularly , they most often damage the pavement on bridges , not the network of steel supporting them .
2007_05_01_1844232	4	Although many recently built connectors and overpasses have much of their steel encased in concrete to protect them from the elements , it is not unusual for some of the steel , particularly in support beams underneath , to be exposed .
2007_05_01_1844232	5	And concrete , while affording some insulation , can crack and break up when exposed to extreme fire , too . ''
2007_05_01_1844232	6	Even if it were a concrete bridge it would have had similar damage , but maybe not as dramatic , '' said Frieder Seible , dean of the engineering school at the University of California , San Diego , and chairman of the State Department of Transportation 's seismic advisory board .
2007_05_01_1844232	7	The 170-foot section of an overpass that failed in Oakland , Calif. , on Sunday endured tremendous heat from a burning gasoline tanker truck that had crashed and exploded .
2007_05_01_1844232	8	The driver of the truck suffered moderate burns , but no one else was injured . ''
2007_05_01_1844232	9	It is not like there is a bridge design that would withstand this kind of thermal load , '' Dr. Seible said , calling the Oakland overpass '' a very common and economical type '' of design .
2007_05_01_1844232	10	Applying fire-resistant materials to bridges and overpasses , engineers said , would substantially drive up costs for a rare event . ''
2007_05_01_1844232	11	The probability of these things happening are pretty low , '' said Andrew W. Herrmann , a consulting bridge engineer in New York City . ''
2007_05_01_1844232	12	The cost to protect every overpass would be outrageous . ''
2007_05_01_1844232	13	The section of bridge that collapsed in the fire on Sunday was built in the 1950s .
2007_05_01_1844232	14	It landed on another overpass , built in the 1990s as part of the restoration of a freeway heavily damaged in an earthquake in 1989 .
2007_05_01_1844232	15	Such intense fires have occurred from time to time .
2007_05_01_1844232	16	A section of Interstate 95 in Bridgeport , Conn. , buckled in 2004 after a truck carrying heating oil caught fire and damaged steel supports .
2007_05_01_1844232	17	A trash fire under Interstate 78 in Newark in August 1989 twisted the steel and buckled the roadway .
2007_05_01_1844232	18	But many engineers , trained to consider the improbable , did not imagine a fire causing such extensive damage .
2007_05_01_1844232	19	In California , concerns most often focus on earthquakes , which in recent years have heavily damaged freeways and overpasses .
2007_05_01_1844232	20	Most of the bridges and overpasses have been retrofitted to prevent heavy quake damage , officials said . ''
2007_05_01_1844232	21	We worry about the seismic things in California , '' said Loring A. Wyllie Jr. , a San Francisco engineer and member of the International Association for Bridge and Structural Engineers who had frequently driven over the collapsed connector . ''
2007_05_01_1844232	22	I never thought about a fire doing that . ''
2007_05_01_1844232	23	Engineers face several challenges in repairing the overpass .
2007_05_01_1844232	24	The cost of steel has been rising because of a boom in high-rise construction , causing some shortages .
2007_05_01_1844232	25	Engineers not involved in the repair said it appeared that at least some of the girders would need to be custom-made , further driving up costs .
2007_05_01_1844232	26	Will Kempton , director of the California Department of Transportation , said officials had not yet estimated the cost of the work or a timetable for completion .
2007_05_01_1844232	27	Engineers , he said , are still assessing the damage .
2007_05_01_1844232	28	Dr. Seible said that with a speedy contractor the work could probably be done in months , but keeping motorists happy will be difficult . ''
2007_05_01_1844232	29	This can be done quickly , '' he said . ''
2007_05_01_1844232	30	But the traffic in the Bay Area does not stop because of it . ''
2007_05_01_1844233	0	We Americans believe instinctively in the power of positive thinking .
2007_05_01_1844233	1	Whether one is fighting a cancer , an insurgency or just an unyielding problem at work , the prevailing wisdom is that thinking positive is the key -- The Secret , even -- to success .
2007_05_01_1844233	2	But the key , it seems to me , is actually negative thinking : looking for , and sometimes expecting , failure .
2007_05_01_1844233	3	We were given a revealing and , for a surgeon like me , disheartening example recently with the scandal at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center .
2007_05_01_1844233	4	The real puzzle was how one institution could be responsible for helping to save the highest percentage of battle-wounded soldiers in history and for providing such disturbingly neglectful care afterward .
2007_05_01_1844233	5	Soldiers told of extraordinary care at Walter Reed that had saved them despite multiple limbs blown away , burns over 90 percent of their bodies , brain injuries previously considered unsurvivable .
2007_05_01_1844233	6	And then they told of outpatient facilities , at the same hospital , where wheelchair-bound soldiers were stranded without food , the brain-injured denied aid because they could n't fill out forms .
2007_05_01_1844233	7	The final report recently released by the military 's independent review group did not find good people in one department and bad people in another .
2007_05_01_1844233	8	The soldiers testified over and over about how '' caring '' and '' dedicated '' they found Walter Reed 's personnel to be . ''
2007_05_01_1844233	9	The staff here is great , '' a wounded officer insisted .
2007_05_01_1844233	10	But in one part of the hospital good people succeeded , and in the other good people failed .
2007_05_01_1844233	11	The review revealed severe strains -- from plans to close Walter Reed in four years and orders to privatize certain services -- but these pressures applied everywhere at the hospital .
2007_05_01_1844233	12	The primary difference was whether leaders accepted the value of negative thinking or not .
2007_05_01_1844233	13	Consider how Walter Reed helped lower the death rate for wounded soldiers .
2007_05_01_1844233	14	It was 25 percent in the first Persian Gulf war ; today it is less than 10 percent .
2007_05_01_1844233	15	Trauma care did not change .
2007_05_01_1844233	16	Medical personnel are actually stretched thinner than before .
2007_05_01_1844233	17	But they have tracked weekly data on injuries and survival rates , and actively looked for failures and how to overcome them .
2007_05_01_1844233	18	Nothing was too trivial .
2007_05_01_1844233	19	During a visit with colleagues at Walter Reed early in the Iraq war , I was struck , for example , by their attention to eye-injury statistics .
2007_05_01_1844233	20	Instead of being proud of saving some soldiers from blindness , the doctors asked a harder , more unnerving question : why had so many injuries occurred ?
2007_05_01_1844233	21	They discovered that the young soldiers were n't wearing their protective goggles .
2007_05_01_1844233	22	Too ugly , the soldiers said .
2007_05_01_1844233	23	So the military switched to cooler-looking Wiley X ballistic eyewear .
2007_05_01_1844233	24	The soldiers wore their eyegear more consistently , and the eye-injury rate dropped immediately .
2007_05_01_1844233	25	Encouraged by leaders to think negative , medical staff members also reported on transport problems for the injured , soldiers ' not wearing their Kevlar , communication glitches , unexpected infections -- and instituted changes to address them .
2007_05_01_1844233	26	The result : they are saving soldiers who 'd never have been saved before .
2007_05_01_1844233	27	Contrast this with the same leaders ' approach to care afterward .
2007_05_01_1844233	28	The independent review group found zero effort to track how soldiers were doing in rehabilitation .
2007_05_01_1844233	29	No one pushed to discover failures .
2007_05_01_1844233	30	As a result , failures were unrecognized , yet everywhere to be seen .
2007_05_01_1844233	31	The review group found the same problems The Washington Post had : disorganized , bureaucratic care with glaring gaps ; dismal living conditions ; dangerous staff shortages . ''
2007_05_01_1844233	32	It was a one-sided representation , '' said the Army medical chief and former Walter Reed commander Lt. Gen. Kevin Kiley when the atrocious conditions were first exposed . ''
2007_05_01_1844233	33	While we have some issues here , this is not a horrific , catastrophic failure . ''
2007_05_01_1844233	34	He was just trying to think positive .
2007_05_01_1844233	35	Negative thinking is unquestionably painful .
2007_05_01_1844233	36	It involves finding and exposing your inadequacies , which can be overwhelming .
2007_05_01_1844233	37	And not every problem discovered can be solved .
2007_05_01_1844233	38	You live in a state of perpetual dissatisfaction .
2007_05_01_1844233	39	That 's an unhealthy way to be in large parts of life : you do n't want to constantly seek out the inadequacies of your children , your looks , your abilities as you age .
2007_05_01_1844233	40	But in running schools or businesses , in planning war , in caring for the sick and injured ?
2007_05_01_1844233	41	Negative thinking may be exactly what we need .
2007_05_01_1844233	42	Guest Columnist Atul Gawande , a general surgeon at Harvard Medical School and a New Yorker staff writer , is the author of '' Better : A Surgeon 's Notes on Performance . ''
2007_05_01_1844233	43	He is a guest columnist this month .
2007_05_01_1844234	0	In this presidential campaign , we need somebody who wants to address the question President Bush once raised : '' Is our children learning ? ''
2007_05_01_1844234	1	International testing shows that U.S. schools do a lousy job teaching math and science , in particular .
2007_05_01_1844234	2	And far too many American students are n't going to college or even completing high school , undermining our competitiveness for decades to come .
2007_05_01_1844234	3	Moreover , the U.S. education system reinforces the gulfs of poverty and race .
2007_05_01_1844234	4	Well-off white kids tend to go to good schools that propel them ahead , while many poor black and Hispanic kids attend bad schools that hold them back .
2007_05_01_1844234	5	For inspiration , presidential candidates might look at this bold three-part plan for improving American schools : End requirements for teacher certification .
2007_05_01_1844234	6	Make tenure more difficult to get so weak teachers can be weeded out after two or three years on the job .
2007_05_01_1844234	7	Award $ 15,000 annual bonuses to good teachers for as long as they teach at schools in low-income areas .
2007_05_01_1844234	8	Those ideas are cribbed from a provocative report on education from the Hamilton Project , which is affiliated with the Brookings Institution .
2007_05_01_1844234	9	The report was prepared by Robert Gordon of the Center for American Progress , Thomas Kane of Harvard and Douglas Staiger of Dartmouth , and it fits in with a burst of other research pointing in similar directions .
2007_05_01_1844234	10	In the past , we tried to ensure the quality of teachers through certification procedures .
2007_05_01_1844234	11	But that has failed .
2007_05_01_1844234	12	Growing evidence indicates that certification requirements limit the pool of potential teachers -- and discourage midcareer switches into teaching -- without accomplishing much else . ''
2007_05_01_1844234	13	Teachers vary considerably in the extent to which they promote student learning , but whether a teacher is certified or not is largely irrelevant to predicting their effectiveness , '' concluded a report last year for the National Bureau of Economic Research .
2007_05_01_1844234	14	The reality is that paper credentials ca n't predict who will be an effective teacher .
2007_05_01_1844234	15	A half-dozen studies have found that teachers with graduate degrees are n't any better than teachers without them .
2007_05_01_1844234	16	Other studies show that teachers who did well on their own SATs , or went to selective colleges or had high G.P.A. 's , do n't make significantly better teachers , either .
2007_05_01_1844234	17	Yet teachers still vary tremendously in their effectiveness , as the Hamilton Project study found when it examined results in Los Angeles schools .
2007_05_01_1844234	18	It looked at the 25 percent of teachers who raised their students ' test scores the most , and the 25 percent who raised students ' scores the least .
2007_05_01_1844234	19	A student assigned to a class with a teacher in the top 25 percent could expect -- after just one year -- to be 10 percentile points higher than a similar student with a bottom-tier teacher . ''
2007_05_01_1844234	20	Moving up ( or down ) 10 percentile points in one year is a massive impact , '' the authors wrote . ''
2007_05_01_1844234	21	For some perspective , the black-white achievement gap nationally is roughly 34 percentile points .
2007_05_01_1844234	22	Therefore , if the effects were to accumulate , having a top-quartile teacher rather than a bottom-quartile teacher four years in a row would be enough to close the black-white test score gap . ''
2007_05_01_1844234	23	The Hamilton Project study recommends that the weakest 25 percent of new teachers should be denied tenure and eliminated after two or three years on the job ( teachers improve a lot in the first two years , but not much after that ) .
2007_05_01_1844234	24	That approach , it estimates , would raise students ' average test scores by 14 percentile points by the time they graduated . ''
2007_05_01_1844234	25	There 's no decision that school districts make that 's more important than the decision regarding who is going to stand in front of the classroom , '' Professor Kane said . ''
2007_05_01_1844234	26	Yet most districts spend more time choosing textbooks than they do reviewing the performance of teachers on their first few years on the job . ''
2007_05_01_1844234	27	School reform could also play a major role in fighting poverty and spreading opportunity .
2007_05_01_1844234	28	One sound proposal is to pay substantial bonuses to get the most effective teachers into schools with low-income students .
2007_05_01_1844234	29	It 's simply unfair for America 's neediest students to be continually assigned to the weakest teachers , perhaps consigning them to another generation of poverty .
2007_05_01_1844234	30	Higher pay will help recruit and retain excellent teachers .
2007_05_01_1844234	31	Neither Democrats nor Republicans have offered much leadership on education .
2007_05_01_1844234	32	Democrats have been too close to teachers ' unions to rock the boat , and Republicans do n't invest in education -- so Mr. Bush 's No Child Left Behind effort has ended up as an underfinanced mess .
2007_05_01_1844234	33	What we need now is for a presidential candidate to seize these ideas and run with them .
2007_05_01_1844235	0	FOR the past few weeks , the world has been riveted by the difficulties of Paul Wolfowitz , president of the World Bank , regarding a potential conflict of interest involving the salary of his partner , also a senior official there .
2007_05_01_1844235	1	With the bank 's board deliberating this week over how to handle the charges , the controversy now needlessly and regrettably threatens Mr. Wolfowitz 's presidency , which has been largely defined by his energetic support for a new Africa that is struggling to emerge .
2007_05_01_1844235	2	Over the last two years , Mr. Wolfowitz has effectively directed the bank 's energies toward fighting poverty and improving human life .
2007_05_01_1844235	3	He is a champion of using international development institutions to deal with some of the world 's major problems .
2007_05_01_1844235	4	And he has been a steadfast supporter of the efforts of African organizations to rescue our people from the scourge of misrule , which leads to poverty , disease and early death .
2007_05_01_1844235	5	Over the last three years , Nigeria , once the emblem of outlandish corruption , has become a leading reformer , and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission , which I head , has been at the cutting edge of these efforts .
2007_05_01_1844235	6	The enormous challenges we face would have proved almost insurmountable without external help , especially from the World Bank under Mr. Wolfowitz .
2007_05_01_1844235	7	When disgruntled lawmakers here tried to cut off our financing and shut down critical aspects of our operation , a World Bank grant of $ 5 million allowed us to bring to closure important cases of political corruption involving key members of Nigeria 's ruling elite , including members of the executive branch and Parliament .
2007_05_01_1844235	8	Today our work receives accolades from all corners of the globe , and the financial and moral support of our thoughtful and courageous allies has played a crucial role in our success .
2007_05_01_1844235	9	In a country that never saw a single conviction for fraud or corruption before the beginning of our reform campaign , we now have 150 convictions , with 400 more cases awaiting decision in the courts .
2007_05_01_1844235	10	We have also recovered $ 5 billion in stolen property .
2007_05_01_1844235	11	We have brought powerful politicians and businessmen to account through the criminal justice system .
2007_05_01_1844235	12	These developments are gradually improving the integrity of our national life .
2007_05_01_1844235	13	Two weeks ago , Nigeria had its first general election intended to pass power from one elected government to another .
2007_05_01_1844235	14	While the election did not meet the high standards we set for ourselves , it did reveal that for citizens , the fight against corruption was a top priority -- right up there with food , health care and education .
2007_05_01_1844235	15	In other words , Nigerians made the same connection between runaway corruption and human suffering that Mr. Wolfowitz rightly does .
2007_05_01_1844235	16	Corruption is the greatest challenge to progress across much of the developing world , and as we in Nigeria know from bitter experience , this is particularly so in Africa .
2007_05_01_1844235	17	As Mr. Wolfowitz remarked in a recent speech , some two million Africans die from AIDS-related illnesses each year , while nearly 3,000 African children die each day from malaria and nearly 40 million are not in school .
2007_05_01_1844235	18	All this , he noted , despite $ 300 billion in international aid to Africa over the last 20 years .
2007_05_01_1844235	19	Corruption has not only produced injustice and a chronic failure to effectively manage international support , it has also led to the squandering of Africa 's considerable human and natural resources .
2007_05_01_1844235	20	Nigeria has made nearly half a trillion dollars from oil in less than five decades -- a figure that dwarfs that of international aid to the whole of Africa .
2007_05_01_1844235	21	And yet , around 70 percent of Nigerians live in conditions of dispiriting poverty , on incomes of less than a dollar a day .
2007_05_01_1844235	22	Corruption kills far more effectively than AIDS , malaria or war .
2007_05_01_1844235	23	On my recent visit to the World Bank in Washington , I was greatly impressed with the remarkable changes in policy and direction that Mr. Wolfowitz had undertaken , as well as by the diversity of talents he had convened to execute his vision of a fairer world .
2007_05_01_1844235	24	The bank 's secretary and two vice presidents are Africans -- one was my colleague in the Nigerian cabinet .
2007_05_01_1844235	25	Another vice president is Salvadoran .
2007_05_01_1844235	26	Mr. Wolfowitz spoke eloquently for those of us in poor countries last month when he exhorted citizens of the industrial world : '' As we go back to our comfortable beds tonight , we should think about the voiceless millions who may not even have beds at all , who go to sleep hungry , sick and uncertain about their future .
2007_05_01_1844235	27	For many it 's literally a matter of life and death . ''
2007_05_01_1844235	28	And he has matched words with deeds through initiatives to promote greater international cooperation with poor countries , especially regarding the recovery of assets from pilfered resources .
2007_05_01_1844235	29	Effective efforts at fighting corruption can not stop at our borders when up to 80 percent of the '' grand corruption '' perpetrated in Africa is dependent on international mechanisms that facilitate money laundering .
2007_05_01_1844235	30	Mr. Wolfowitz has made a praiseworthy effort to halt the illicit drain of money from the coffers of poor countries .
2007_05_01_1844235	31	Just this simple step -- denying a haven for money stolen from a poor country -- addresses more than half the problem of corruption in Africa .
2007_05_01_1844235	32	It would be a terrible shame to bring all these efforts to a premature halt .
2007_05_01_1844235	33	Mr. Wolfowitz has openly acknowledged responsibility for the mistake he made .
2007_05_01_1844235	34	He has apologized and expressed willingness to accept the decision of the bank 's board of directors .
2007_05_01_1844235	35	But the board should consider how important his error really was , especially considering that the bank 's internal documents suggest that Mr. Wolfowitz tried to follow the rules from the beginning .
2007_05_01_1844235	36	The board should avoid lending credence to the widespread suspicion that Mr. Wolfowitz is really being punished for his previous role in the United States Department of Defense .
2007_05_01_1844235	37	And it should consider the benefit Mr. Wolfowitz has brought to countries like Nigeria .
2007_05_01_1844235	38	Op-Ed Contributor Nuhu Ribadu is the chairman of Nigeria 's Economic and Financial Crimes Commission .
2007_05_01_1844236	0	WHEN the civilian hierarchy fails them , soldiers tend to seek solace in Clausewitz 's observation that war is an extension of politics .
2007_05_01_1844236	1	But in 2005 and 2006 the reverse was true in Iraq : the battle churned in place , steadily eroding the administration 's credibility and America 's psyche , while most politicians stood on the sidelines , content to hurl insults at one another until the battlefield offered a clear political course .
2007_05_01_1844236	2	What was most remarkable , however , was the military 's inability to grab the reins and articulate a realistic war plan for Iraq .
2007_05_01_1844236	3	At home , recruiting , supply and deployment crises were solved ; but in Iraq the generals continued to offer assessments of the fight that were as obviously inaccurate as those trumpeted by the politicians .
2007_05_01_1844236	4	The goal was to put Iraqi forces in the lead , but as a consequence , large-scale battlefield adaptation was scarce .
2007_05_01_1844236	5	Today the civil-military relationship has righted itself , yet soldiers like me who believe that Iraq can be stabilized face a bitter irony .
2007_05_01_1844236	6	On one hand , the military is finally making meaningful adjustments to the complex fight .
2007_05_01_1844236	7	On the other , the politicians are finally asserting themselves .
2007_05_01_1844236	8	The tragedy is that the two groups are going in opposite directions .
2007_05_01_1844236	9	Most Americans who have served side by side with Iraqi units , especially those of us who have been advisers to Iraqi companies and battalions , believe that significant numbers of our soldiers will be needed in Iraq for another decade .
2007_05_01_1844236	10	This timeline is about average for a classic insurgency , and optimistic for one so muddied by tribal feuds and religious hatred .
2007_05_01_1844236	11	American soldiers in Iraq are constantly asked about our commitment to a fight we started .
2007_05_01_1844236	12	Most of the advisers I got to know during my most recent tour , which ended in February , were quick to try to assuage their Iraqi counterparts ' concerns and dismissive of the calls for withdrawal by American politicians , news of which trickled onto the battlefield during the winter .
2007_05_01_1844236	13	After all , the surge itself would not be fully under way until mid-summer .
2007_05_01_1844236	14	Surely the politicians would give it a chance to work .
2007_05_01_1844236	15	The two Congressional votes last week establishing timelines for withdrawing American troops completely undermined such assurances .
2007_05_01_1844236	16	The confusion stems from an inherent contradiction in our politics : Though the burden of war is shouldered by few , the majority of Americans want to vacate Iraq , and the percentages are increasing .
2007_05_01_1844236	17	Something has to give .
2007_05_01_1844236	18	We 're four years into a global conflict that will span generations , fighting virulent ideologues obsessed with expansion .
2007_05_01_1844236	19	It 's time for those who are against the war in Iraq to consider the probable military consequences of withdrawal .
2007_05_01_1844236	20	But it is also time for supporters of the war to step back and recognize that public opinion in great part dictates our martial options .
2007_05_01_1844236	21	It 's hard for a soldier like me to reconcile a political jab like Senator Harry Reid 's '' this war is lost , and this surge is not accomplishing anything '' when it 's made in front of a banner that reads '' Support Our Troops . ''
2007_05_01_1844236	22	But the politician 's job is different from the soldier 's .
2007_05_01_1844236	23	Mr. Reid 's belief -- that the best way to support the troops is by acknowledging defeat and pulling them out of Iraq -- is likely shared by a large slice of the population , which gives it legitimacy .
2007_05_01_1844236	24	It seems oddly detached , however , from what 's happening on the battlefield .
2007_05_01_1844236	25	The Iraqi battalion I lived with is stationed outside of Habbaniya , a small city in violent Anbar Province .
2007_05_01_1844236	26	Together with a fledgling police force and a Marine battalion , these Iraqi troops made Habbaniya a relatively secure place : it has a souk where Iraqi soldiers can shop outside their armored Humvees , public generators that do n't mysteriously explode , children who walk to school on their own .
2007_05_01_1844236	27	The area became so stable , in fact , that it attracted the attention of Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia .
2007_05_01_1844236	28	In late February , the Sunni insurgents blew up the mosque , killing 36 .
2007_05_01_1844236	29	If American politicians pull the marines out of Anbar , the Iraqi soldiers told me , they too will have to pull back , ceding some zones to protect others .
2007_05_01_1844236	30	The same is true in the Baghdad neighborhoods where the early stages of the surge have made life livable again .
2007_05_01_1844236	31	Then America will be left with a dilemma : we could either vainly try to patrol Iraq 's borders to keep the murderous foreign insurgents out and the swollen ranks of Al Qaeda in , or we could make assaults every six months or so into fallen cities and neighborhoods , like the bloody fight to retake Falluja in 2004 .
2007_05_01_1844236	32	Either way , the cost of quitting will be heavier fighting by American troops .
2007_05_01_1844236	33	So how can we reconcile this military reality with the desire by the majority of Americans to reduce troop levels in Iraq ?
2007_05_01_1844236	34	The current surge may provide an excellent opportunity , if we acknowledge two things : Iraq is now a law enforcement war and Iraqi security forces are best suited to fight it .
2007_05_01_1844236	35	The surge must be accompanied by a commensurate surge in Iraqi troops .
2007_05_01_1844236	36	To date , the Iraqis have simply been shifting soldiers from other areas into Baghdad .
2007_05_01_1844236	37	But these are stop-gap soldiers -- as are our own -- when what we seek is permanence .
2007_05_01_1844236	38	The Iraqi government must double the size of its army , to 300,000 combat troops from 150,000 today .
2007_05_01_1844236	39	The American surge will give them the breathing room to do so , and a deadline by which it must be done .
2007_05_01_1844236	40	The idea is that , starting this fall , the Iraqi units would bulk up so the American units could begin to break up , moving to an advisory model in which the number of American soldiers embedded with Iraqi units triples while the overall United States force declines .
2007_05_01_1844236	41	Today many American patrols operate independently .
2007_05_01_1844236	42	In a year 's time , ideally , no American patrol would leave its base without a fully integrated Iraqi presence .
2007_05_01_1844236	43	Oddly , the Congressional resolutions calling for withdrawal would allow for this continued American advisory presence , somehow not including these troops as '' combat forces . ''
2007_05_01_1844236	44	So even those members of Congress who voted for the resolutions could support bulking up the number of Americans assigned to Iraqi units without appearing as hypocrites .
2007_05_01_1844236	45	The issue will be the numbers .
2007_05_01_1844236	46	A meaningful advisory force -- both the embedded troops and the support personnel -- would likely mean 75,000 Americans still in Iraq in the fall of 2008 .
2007_05_01_1844236	47	This is about half of what we 'll have in place for the surge this summer , but more than the supporters of the resolutions might expect .
2007_05_01_1844236	48	It will take political courage for these politicians to agree to the needed advisory forces .
2007_05_01_1844236	49	But it is the only way the Iraqis themselves will ever be able to make their country secure .
2007_05_01_1844236	50	And that is the one goal on which all Americans , those who support the war and those who '' support the troops , '' should be able to agree .

2007_05_01_1844237	0	The Bush administration proposed on Monday leasing out millions of acres along the coasts of Alaska and Virginia to oil and gas drillers , a move that would end a longstanding ban on drilling in those environmentally sensitive areas .
2007_05_01_1844237	1	Both areas have been closed to new drilling for many years .
2007_05_01_1844237	2	The areas off Virginia are still covered by laws that prohibit new drilling in all areas along the Atlantic and Pacific seaboards .
2007_05_01_1844237	3	But Congress lifted the prohibition on Bristol Bay off Alaska in 2003 , and President Bush lifted an executive order in January that had blocked drilling there through 2012 .
2007_05_01_1844237	4	In the case of Virginia , administration officials are hoping to capitalize on interest in drilling expressed by the state legislature , which passed a bill last year asking the federal government to allow exploration for natural gas in waters 50 miles or farther from the state coastline .
2007_05_01_1844237	5	Both proposals are part of a broader five-year plan to open up 48 million acres along the outer continental shelf to oil and gas drilling .
2007_05_01_1844237	6	Unless Congress objects within 60 days , most of the five-year plan will go into effect , though resistance has been voiced .
2007_05_01_1844237	7	Starting this year , the Interior Department plans to offer leases on about 8.3 million acres in the central region of the Gulf of Mexico , which Congress specifically approved for offshore drilling late last year .
2007_05_01_1844237	8	But the department hopes to open up far more than that .
2007_05_01_1844237	9	It would offer leases on 37 million acres off Alaska , starting as early as 2008 , in vast new areas in the Beaufort Sea , the Chukchi Sea and the Cook Inlet .
2007_05_01_1844237	10	None of those areas have been subject to a drilling ban , but none have been tapped before .
2007_05_01_1844237	11	Starting in 2011 , the Interior Department would also lease out 5.6 million acres in Bristol Bay along the Alaska Peninsula , an area that Congress closed off after the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989 .
2007_05_01_1844237	12	If the plan can get approval from Congress , it would offer up three million acres off the coast of Virginia , starting in 2012 . ''
2007_05_01_1844237	13	The outer continental shelf is a vital source of domestic oil and natural gas for America , especially in light of sharply rising energy prices , '' said Dirk Kempthorne , secretary of the interior .
2007_05_01_1844237	14	But Democrats in Congress criticized the plans for Alaska and Virginia , and they are likely to extend the current ban on drilling off Virginia .
2007_05_01_1844237	15	Gov. Tim Kaine of Virginia , a Democrat , said he supported limited drilling for exploration but has refused to endorse production . ''
2007_05_01_1844237	16	Whatever pressing energy issue comes before the American people , the Bush administration always responds with the same oil answer : more oil , '' said Representative Nick J. Rahall II , Democrat of West Virginia and chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee .
2007_05_01_1844237	17	The proposal includes measures to protect against damage to coastal areas from oil spills and other accidents .
2007_05_01_1844237	18	It would not allow drilling within 50 miles of the Virginia shore and would wall off an additional '' obstruction zone '' near the mouth of Chesapeake Bay .
2007_05_01_1844237	19	Some environmental advocates said , however , that the proposed protections would be inadequate and could jeopardize fishing areas . ''
2007_05_01_1844237	20	The Bush administration is zeroing in on the most environmentally sensitive areas for offshore drilling , '' said Richard Charter , a lobbyist for Defenders of Wildlife and co-chairman of the National Outer Continental Shelf Coalition . ''
2007_05_01_1844237	21	These areas that they are characterizing as buffer zones are woefully inadequate when you consider that the Exxon Valdez oil spill traveled hundreds of miles in a matter of weeks . ''
2007_05_01_1844237	22	It is not clear how much fuel lies in the areas that would be made available .
2007_05_01_1844237	23	Interior Department officials estimated that the entire plan could produce 10 billion barrels of additional oil and 45 trillion cubic feet of additional natural gas over the next 40 years .
2007_05_01_1844237	24	That would be equal to about 16 months of the United States ' current oil consumption and about two years of its current consumption of natural gas .
2007_05_01_1844237	25	The oil industry 's two big trade associations , the American Petroleum Institute and the Independent Petroleum Association of America , both praised the administration plan and urged Congress to open even more areas to drilling .
2007_05_01_1844237	26	Royal Dutch Shell has been particularly eager to explore and develop the areas in Alaska , and has hired a number of former state and federal officials to help build popular support in communities near the proposed drilling areas .
2007_05_01_1844237	27	If the administration does lease out areas in Alaska , companies may be entitled to a special reprieve from paying royalties to the government .
2007_05_01_1844237	28	In passing the Energy Policy Act of 2005 , Congress extended what is known as '' royalty relief '' for deepwater drillers to cover oil and gas produced in '' frontier areas '' that are far from transportation centers .
2007_05_01_1844237	29	The administration plan could encounter heavy resistance .
2007_05_01_1844237	30	New Jersey 's two senators , Frank R. Lautenberg and Robert Menendez , both Democrats , warned in a joint statement that the plan to allow drilling near Virginia was unacceptable because it '' starts us down the slippery slope that could lead us to drilling off New Jersey 's coast . ''
2007_05_01_1844237	31	Congress has extended an annual moratorium on leasing along the Atlantic and Pacific Coasts for more than 20 years .
2007_05_01_1844237	32	Speaker Nancy Pelosi , Democrat of California , has been a staunch supporter of the drilling bans and has protested Mr. Bush 's decision in January to lift the prohibition for Bristol Bay .
2007_05_01_1844238	0	The Democrats ' debate last week offered a prime site for presidential hopefuls to promote their ideas , credentials and , most important , affection for Representative James E. Clyburn , Democrat of South Carolina .
2007_05_01_1844238	1	Few endorsements have been as coveted as that of Mr. Clyburn , the House majority whip , African-American leader and prominent figure in an early primary state .
2007_05_01_1844238	2	Mr. Clyburn says he is hesitant to endorse anyone for fear that it will drive the other candidates away from the state .
2007_05_01_1844238	3	But that did not stop the groveling on Thursday as he made his pre-debate rounds at South Carolina State University and on Friday at his annual fish fry in Columbia , an event that all the major Democratic candidates attended ( in Clyburn lapel stickers ) .
2007_05_01_1844238	4	When asked whether any candidates had called him on his birthday , Mr. Clyburn said no , and he was not happy about it .
2007_05_01_1844238	5	He was kidding , presumably .
2007_05_01_1844238	6	But they will all have another chance on July 21 .

2007_05_01_1844239	0	Comparison shopper alert : is Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton the Brand X presidential candidate , and Senator Barack Obama the Brand Y ?
2007_05_01_1844239	1	Although former President Bill Clinton , for one , does not see much difference between the two when it comes to Iraq , the rivals apparently part ways on drinking preferences .
2007_05_01_1844239	2	In the Democratic presidential hopefuls debate on Thursday , Mrs. Clinton was seen with a bottle of Dasani water , a Coca-Cola product , while Mr. Obama drank Aquafina water , a Pepsi product .
2007_05_01_1844239	3	Was this product placement on a political stage ?
2007_05_01_1844239	4	If so , their campaign contributors might want to take another look at the candidates .
2007_05_01_1844239	5	Mr. Obama raised more money than Mrs. Clinton from Coke employees ( $ 4,300 versus her $ 2,300 ) , and Mrs. Clinton took in more from Pepsi people ( $ 4,600 to his $ 3,050 ) , according to the candidates ' campaign finance reports .

2007_05_01_1844240	0	President Bush this week will formally reject the Iraq spending bill , with its timeline for winding down the war .
2007_05_01_1844240	1	But that will hardly bring the matter to a close for the Democratic presidential hopefuls , especially those in the Senate .
2007_05_01_1844240	2	Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut is the lone presidential candidate in the Senate who supports measures to limit the mission and end financing for most troops by March 31 .
2007_05_01_1844240	3	Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York and Barack Obama of Illinois said they intended to fight to gain enough votes to override a veto .
2007_05_01_1844240	4	But even Democrats leaders predict that will not occur .
2007_05_01_1844240	5	So Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama will soon have to find a fresh response .
2007_05_01_1844240	6	John Edwards of North Carolina said Democrats should not buckle and should send the same bill to Mr. Bush again .
2007_05_01_1844240	7	So the senators have some navigating to do when it comes time to vote on the next step .
2007_05_01_1844240	8	Do they give Mr. Bush the financing without a plan to wind down the war ?
2007_05_01_1844240	9	( Mr. Obama learned the hazards of this when he suggested such an approach last month and endured brisk criticism . )
2007_05_01_1844240	10	Do they propose to authorize a month-by-month spending plan for the war ?
2007_05_01_1844240	11	Or do they keep sending back the same bill ?

2007_05_01_1844241	3	A fan of '' To Kill a Mockingbird '' may well focus on racial justice .
2007_05_01_1844241	4	When asked his favorite novel in an interview shown yesterday on the Fox News Channel , Mitt Romney pointed to '' Battlefield Earth , '' a novel by L. Ron Hubbard , the founder of Scientology .
2007_05_01_1844241	5	That book was turned into a film by John Travolta , a Scientologist .
2007_05_01_1844241	6	A spokesman said later it was one of Mr. Romney 's favorite novels . ''
2007_05_01_1844241	7	I 'm not in favor of his religion by any means , '' Mr. Romney , a Mormon , said . ''
2007_05_01_1844241	8	But he wrote a book called ` Battlefield Earth ' that was a very fun science-fiction book . ''

2007_05_01_1844242	1	Many factors can influence a political race , and every handicapper has an equation for predicting .
2007_05_01_1844242	2	Since the late 1980s , a group of psychologists at the University of Pennsylvania has had a system based on a single factor : optimism .
2007_05_01_1844242	3	The researchers , by analyzing stump speeches , have found that the most optimistic candidate usually wins , taking more than 80 percent of the presidential elections since 1900 .
2007_05_01_1844242	4	The system is no oracle .
2007_05_01_1844242	5	It picked Michael S. Dukakis over George Bush in 1988 .
2007_05_01_1844242	6	This year , the analysis , led by Andrew Rosenthal , Prateek Sharma and Martin Seligman , found a clear front-runner , Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton .
2007_05_01_1844242	7	Rudolph W. Giuliani brought up the rear , and the other candidates bunched in the middle .
2007_05_01_1844242	8	The research team evaluated 15 comments from each candidate , listed in random order and without naming the source .
2007_05_01_1844242	9	The optimism rating depended largely on how candidates characterized problems : as temporary and manageable , signaling optimism , or chronic and global . ''

2007_05_01_1844242	11	They want to kill us . ''
2007_05_01_1844242	12	Voters pick up these signals , consciously or not , and for good reason , Dr. Seligman said , adding , '' We know optimists tend to try harder under adversity , and that is a very important quality '' in a leader .

2007_05_01_1844243	0	Government investigators said Monday that byproducts from pet food contaminated with wheat gluten imported from China were used in chicken feed on some farms in Indiana .
2007_05_01_1844243	1	The latest revelation came as part of the investigation into imported rice protein concentrate and wheat gluten that have been found to contain melamine and melamine-related compounds .
2007_05_01_1844243	2	Pet food contaminated with melamine has killed at least 16 cats and dogs and sickened thousands of others .
2007_05_01_1844243	3	The Agriculture Department and the Food and Drug Administration said that some 30 broiler poultry farms and eight breeder poultry farms in Indiana had received contaminated feed in early February and fed it to chickens within days of receiving it .
2007_05_01_1844243	4	All of those potentially affected chickens have since been processed .
2007_05_01_1844243	5	The two agencies said they believed the likelihood of illness to people eating contaminated chicken was low because the contamination was most likely diluted .
2007_05_01_1844243	6	Without evidence of harm to humans , the agencies said they were not issuing recalls of any of the processed chicken products .
2007_05_01_1844243	7	The Agriculture Department and the F.D.A. revealed last week that eight pork producers in seven states had purchased adulterated feed .
2007_05_01_1844243	8	Some 6,000 hogs were quarantined as a result in California , Kansas , North Carolina , New York , Oklahoma , South Carolina and Utah .
2007_05_01_1844243	9	Authorities are also in contact with a feed mill in Missouri that might have received adulterated products .
2007_05_01_1844243	10	On Monday , Tyson Foods acknowledged that it had sent nearly 200 hogs that may have eaten feed containing melamine to a pork-processing plant .

2007_05_01_1844244	20	I had to shop at the local stores to find something suitable to wear to client meetings .
2007_05_01_1844244	21	Size was an issue .
2007_05_01_1844244	22	Most Europeans are slim .

2007_05_01_1844244	24	I was able to find a pair of pants .
2007_05_01_1844244	25	They were wide enough , but one inch too short .
2007_05_01_1844244	26	I got a white shirt .

2007_05_01_1844244	28	I found a tie .
2007_05_01_1844244	29	It was olive green , emblazoned with a picture of the Alps .
2007_05_01_1844244	30	Glitter was used to emphasize the snow-capped mountain peaks .
2007_05_01_1844244	31	I used a complimentary razor provided by the hotel .
2007_05_01_1844244	32	It was like shaving with a rock .

2007_05_01_1844245	17	The Government Accountability Office issued a 72-page report last week on potential safety and capacity issues in accommodating the 500 - to 853-seat plane at the 18 domestic airports that are spending a total of nearly $ 1 billion on runway , taxiway and terminal modifications .
2007_05_01_1844245	18	While a big-capacity aircraft can reduce some congestion in carrying so many passengers at once , the size of the plane -- it has a wingspan of 262 feet -- could also reduce the number of flights that airports can handle .
2007_05_01_1844245	19	That is because of the need to maintain extra runway and taxiway separation between A380s and other aircraft , says the report , which is available at www.gao.gov/docsearch/repandtest.html .
2007_05_01_1844245	20	SUMMER CROWDS -- Airport congestion will only become worse when the summer peak travel season arrives .
2007_05_01_1844245	21	According to eSkyGuide , the online flight directory produced by American Express , the average number of scheduled domestic airline flights during June , July and August is up 2.1 percent , to a weekly average of 199,420 over last summer .
2007_05_01_1844245	22	Within that number , flights by low-cost carriers rose 8.7 percent to an average of 38,399 a week .
2007_05_01_1844245	23	International flights are up 2.4 percent over last summer , to an average of 28,077 a week .
2007_05_01_1844246	0	The body language may have been as telling as the testimony .
2007_05_01_1844246	1	The young man suing the Roman Catholic authorities over the sexual abuse he suffered moved restlessly on the witness stand in State Supreme Court here on Monday , as if in constant distress .
2007_05_01_1844246	2	Looking forlorn , he leaned back in his chair , then tilted his head and leaned to the left , then shifted to the right .
2007_05_01_1844246	3	He scooted to the edge of his chair , hunched over and braced his arms on the railing .
2007_05_01_1844246	4	He rubbed his face , looked up , looked down , and sometimes spoke directly to the jury .
2007_05_01_1844246	5	Some of his answers were hesitant and confused .
2007_05_01_1844246	6	Others were not . ''
2007_05_01_1844246	7	Children do n't go to church to have sex with adults , '' he blurted out .
2007_05_01_1844246	8	Now 22 , he testified that at 15 he was induced into heterosexual , homosexual and group sex by Matthew Maiello , the youth ministry director at St. Raphael 's Roman Catholic Church in East Meadow , on Long Island .
2007_05_01_1844246	9	The witness also said that Mr. Maiello gave him marijuana and beer , told him to have sex with a 15-year-old girl from his youth group , and had group sex with both teenagers , sometimes photographing and videotaping it .
2007_05_01_1844246	10	He and the female victim , who is now 23 , filed a $ 150 million civil suit against Mr. Maiello , St. Raphael 's , its pastor and the Diocese of Rockville Centre .
2007_05_01_1844246	11	The suit says the last three defendants bear responsibility because they hired Mr. Maiello without proper background checks , failed to supervise him and ignored complaints about his conduct .
2007_05_01_1844246	12	Mr. Maiello , 33 , is not contesting the suit ; the other defendants deny responsibility .
2007_05_01_1844246	13	In 2003 , he pleaded guilty to the statutory rape of four teenagers , including the two victims suing him .
2007_05_01_1844246	14	He served two years in prison .
2007_05_01_1844246	15	Years after the abuse ended , the witness said he was still haunted by nightmares and panic attacks triggered by things like seeing a parishioner from St. Raphael 's .
2007_05_01_1844246	16	He often resorts to marijuana , pills and alcohol to '' numb '' his feelings , he said .
2007_05_01_1844246	17	His schooling , work and personal relations have all suffered , he said .
2007_05_01_1844246	18	After eight semesters , he has not graduated from community college .
2007_05_01_1844246	19	He recently quit his supermarket job because he was too embarrassed to explain why he needed time off for the trial , he said .
2007_05_01_1844246	20	He had two girlfriends but could not kiss the first because of flashbacks that '' made me nauseous , '' he said .
2007_05_01_1844246	21	He was unable to be intimate with the second , though they loved each other , he said .
2007_05_01_1844246	22	That was two years ago , and he has not had another girlfriend since , he said . ''
2007_05_01_1844246	23	The only sex I had was in an abusive relationship , '' he testified . ''
2007_05_01_1844246	24	I was unable to distinguish between healthy sex and unhealthy sex and abuse . ''
2007_05_01_1844246	25	He said his first sexual encounter with his fellow plaintiff , whom he called a good friend , was directed by Mr. Maiello and took place in the basement of St. Raphael 's convent .
2007_05_01_1844246	26	He was not aroused , he said . ''
2007_05_01_1844246	27	I just felt so disgusted , '' he said . ''
2007_05_01_1844246	28	I was so confused . ''
2007_05_01_1844246	29	But Mr. Maiello persisted the next day , and on many more days , eventually arranging an estimated 100 encounters , the witness said . ''
2007_05_01_1844246	30	He was telling us what to do , step by step , '' the young man said , adding that he felt obligated to comply . ''
2007_05_01_1844246	31	I was in a whole gigantic fog . ''
2007_05_01_1844246	32	When Mr. Maiello turned on the cameras , '' I just wanted to hide under the covers , actually , '' the witness said .
2007_05_01_1844246	33	He still worries that there are naked pictures of him , at 15 , on the Internet .
2007_05_01_1844246	34	Sex with Mr. Maiello was the worst part , he said , because he '' did n't want to have sex with another man . ''
2007_05_01_1844246	35	After Mr. Maiello left St. Raphael 's to teach at Kellenberg Memorial High School , a Catholic school in nearby Uniondale , he invited the two teenagers to the empty auditorium sound room there and said , '' Let 's do it in here , '' the witness said . ''
2007_05_01_1844246	36	The next thing I know , '' the witness said , '' he 's locking the door . ''
2007_05_01_1844246	37	Later , Mr. Maiello tried to get the youth to have sex with a Kellenberg student , showing him panties that supposedly belonged to her . ''
2007_05_01_1844246	38	I said no , '' the witness said , adding that it was his last contact with Mr. Maiello .
2007_05_01_1844246	39	In cross-examination , the lawyer for the church , Brian Davey , challenged the witness 's credibility .
2007_05_01_1844246	40	For example , Mr. Davey asked about the man 's history of disciplinary problems in middle school , before the abuse started , and asked about his use of illegal drugs .
2007_05_01_1844246	41	Throughout the testimony , the female victim sat in the back of the courtroom , jiggling her knees and fidgeting .
2007_05_01_1844246	42	She testified last week .
2007_05_01_1844247	0	In 2003 , when post-9 / 11 security fears were still fresh , New Jersey appropriated $ 23 million to help local governments buy equipment they might need to meet emergencies .
2007_05_01_1844247	1	But according to the state attorney general , municipalities failed to spend $ 2.78 million of that money .
2007_05_01_1844247	2	Now , the unspent money will revert to the state 's general fund .
2007_05_01_1844247	3	In all , 78 municipalities failed to cash in on anywhere from $ 200 to $ 191,000 to complete planned purchases of things like fire trucks , gas masks , riot shields and mobile command vehicles .
2007_05_01_1844247	4	The amount is small compared with the $ 2.5 billion projected deficit in next year 's state budget . ''
2007_05_01_1844247	5	This was reimbursement money , and when we contacted the local governments last year seeking documentation that things were either on order or received , many could not produce it , '' said David Wald , a spokesman for Stuart Rabner , the attorney general .
2007_05_01_1844247	6	After that , Mr. Wald said , the department set a deadline of last December for final applications for $ 4.6 million of the money in the Local Domestic Preparedness Equipment Grant money .
2007_05_01_1844247	7	Municipalities laid claim to less than half of that .
2007_05_01_1844247	8	The program was set up in 2003 , partly in response to local governments ' clamoring for money to supplement federal funds for homeland security .
2007_05_01_1844247	9	The federal money was handed out based on formulas that many believed were unfair to densely populated states like New Jersey .
2007_05_01_1844247	10	Some Republicans in the Legislature criticized the program , saying it directed the bulk of its money to areas controlled by Democrats .
2007_05_01_1844247	11	William G. Dressel Jr. , executive director of the New Jersey League of Municipalities , said that from the beginning there was confusion about the '' time frames '' for spending the money . ''
2007_05_01_1844247	12	I 'm not sure it was communicated to local governments that there was a time limit , '' he said . ''
2007_05_01_1844247	13	There was also some confusion about interpreting exactly what it could be used for . ''
2007_05_01_1844247	14	Albert Greco , city manager of Clifton , which is in Passaic County and has a population of 78,000 , said the problem was with state government and not the municipalities .
2007_05_01_1844247	15	He said that on three occasions the city had fully documented reimbursement requests to the state attorney general 's office but had gotten no response .
2007_05_01_1844247	16	Newark left the most money unclaimed , $ 191,000 , and tiny Somerdale Borough , a community of 5,000 people in Camden County , proved the most efficient spender , leaving 38 cents unspent .
2007_05_01_1844247	17	Plainfield left $ 116,555 , while Carlstadt did not claim $ 134,800 it had originally told state officials it would spend .
2007_05_01_1844249	0	State judges have gone more than eight years without a pay raise .
2007_05_01_1844249	1	It appears they may not get one soon .
2007_05_01_1844249	2	While all sides in Albany agree that judges are overdue for a raise , the matter appears to be caught up in the escalating feud between Gov. Eliot Spitzer and the Senate majority leader , Joseph L. Bruno , who have found little to agree on since they struck a budget deal in late March .
2007_05_01_1844249	3	On Monday , the governor , along with Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo and Judith S. Kaye , the chief judge of New York State , called for judicial pay raises in speeches on the steps of the Court of Appeals .
2007_05_01_1844249	4	But Senate Republicans insist on linking raises for judges to a proposal to create a commission to review raises for legislators , and passed legislation to that effect later on Monday .
2007_05_01_1844249	5	The governor , however , has refused to approve legislative pay raises until lawmakers pass more of his agenda , including an overhaul of campaign finance laws .
2007_05_01_1844249	6	Given that Mr. Bruno has rejected the campaign finance proposal , judicial pay raises appear to be in limbo . ''
2007_05_01_1844249	7	We are not , and I want to be clear on this , we 're not going to take this issue up again in this chamber , not while I 'm here , '' a frustrated Mr. Bruno said on the Senate floor .
2007_05_01_1844249	8	He accused Democratic leaders in the Legislature of reneging on commitments they had reached with him and bowing to the governor 's wishes that they abandon the proposal to raise their salaries .
2007_05_01_1844249	9	Mr. Bruno was especially exasperated that all 62 senators had co-sponsored the pay bill last week only to have most of the 29 Democrats in the Senate withdraw their support on Monday .
2007_05_01_1844249	10	Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver , who has co-sponsored a pay raise bill similar to the Senate 's , said Monday that after discussions with the governor he would also hold off . ''
2007_05_01_1844249	11	Apparently the governor is very persuasive , '' Mr. Bruno said , adding , '' I think that 's unfortunate for elected leaders to be intimidated . ''
2007_05_01_1844249	12	In a statement , Mr. Spitzer said of the Senate Republicans , '' Their action to raise their own pay before passing real reform is the ultimate misstatement of priorities . ''
2007_05_01_1844249	13	Both the Senate and the governor had proposed pay increases for Supreme Court justices of nearly 21 percent , to $ 165,200 , from the current $ 136,700 a year , to bring them in line with federal district court judges .
2007_05_01_1844249	14	Both proposals also included some retroactive increases .
2007_05_01_1844249	15	The Senate 's legislation , based on a proposal made by Judge Kaye , would also create a commission to regularly review raises for all three branches of government . ''
2007_05_01_1844249	16	Our judges expect to treat other people fairly , '' she said in her speech . ''
2007_05_01_1844249	17	They have committed themselves to that .
2007_05_01_1844249	18	They should be treated fairly themselves , do n't you all agree ? ''
2007_05_01_1844249	19	So imagine their distress when we learned just weeks ago that we are caught , trapped , snared in the jaws of Albany politics , '' she said , referring to the lack of a pay raise in the recent budget .
2007_05_01_1844249	20	Mr. Bruno , for his part , threatened to stop talking to Democrats in the Legislature . ''
2007_05_01_1844249	21	We are going to deal with the governor and no one else , '' he told Democrats on the Senate floor . ''
2007_05_01_1844249	22	The governor has said he speaks for you and he said , ' I speak for the speaker . '
2007_05_01_1844249	23	We are a separate branch of government . ''
2007_05_01_1844250	0	Just about everyone who works pays taxes into the fund for federal disability benefits .
2007_05_01_1844250	1	But mercifully , relatively few people ever collect .
2007_05_01_1844250	2	To qualify , you must be unable to work , and your disability must be of such severity that you 'll be out for at least a year or you 're likely to die from it .
2007_05_01_1844250	3	Those criteria are tough but necessary to ensure that resources go to the neediest Americans .
2007_05_01_1844250	4	In the past several years , however , another hurdle has been erected , one that is unacceptable and inhumane .
2007_05_01_1844250	5	Processing delays , mounting since 2000 , have left more than one million applicants languishing without help , some for years .
2007_05_01_1844250	6	The most acute bottlenecks are at the appeals level , where the average processing time is now 515 days -- compared with 274 days in 2000 .
2007_05_01_1844250	7	Such delays are especially pernicious because slightly more than one-quarter of all approved claims are awarded after an appeal hearing , and nearly two-thirds of the people who appeal ultimately prevail .
2007_05_01_1844250	8	Without the benefits they are entitled to , far too many applicants get sicker and experience severe economic hardship , including foreclosures and even homelessness .
2007_05_01_1844250	9	Some applicants die before their appeals are heard .
2007_05_01_1844250	10	The fault lies primarily with Congress .
2007_05_01_1844250	11	For many years , lawmakers have consistently cut into the budget for the Social Security Administration , which administers the disability program .
2007_05_01_1844250	12	Since 2000 , the cumulative shortfall -- the difference between what the agency has asked for and what Congress has appropriated -- is $ 4.4 billion , with more than $ 2 billion of that in the last few years .
2007_05_01_1844250	13	In the same period , demands on the agency have grown , resulting in a chronic shortage of people to do the work .
2007_05_01_1844250	14	Disability claims have risen , to 2.5 million in 2006 from 1.3 million in 2000 , driven in part by the aging of the population .
2007_05_01_1844250	15	Disability claims also tend to rise when jobs are scarce , as was the case during much of the Bush-era economic expansion .
2007_05_01_1844250	16	Research shows that people who would tough out their disabilities during good times turn to government aid when they lose their jobs and are unable to find new ones .
2007_05_01_1844250	17	Congress has also recently imposed new tasks on the Social Security Administration , like assisting with immigration issues .
2007_05_01_1844250	18	You get what you pay for .
2007_05_01_1844250	19	When it comes to helping disabled workers -- as with so many other duties of government -- recent Congresses have not been willing to pay for service that is prompt , professional and compassionate .
2007_05_01_1844250	20	The agency generally gets high marks for productivity and efficiency , and estimates that it needs about $ 10.5 billion a year to be able to do its work adequately .
2007_05_01_1844250	21	The current Congress can begin to fix the disability program by providing the needed funds in the coming budget for 2008 .
2007_05_01_1844250	22	Congress must also work closely with the new commissioner of Social Security , Michael Astrue , to ensure that a plausible plan to conquer the backlog is put in place quickly .
2007_05_01_1844251	0	The long struggle between Turkey 's generals -- the self-appointed custodians of secularism -- and the growing popularity of parties rooted in Islam has taken a dangerous turn .
2007_05_01_1844251	1	Both sides need to step back from the brink for the sake of Turkey 's democracy and its hopes of joining the European Union .
2007_05_01_1844251	2	The crisis came to a head last week after Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his Islamic-oriented party nominated Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul to be Turkey 's next president .
2007_05_01_1844251	3	In that position , Mr. Gul would have the power to nominate judges and university deans and to approve or veto nominations to the cabinet and other sensitive government positions .
2007_05_01_1844251	4	Mr. Gul is a moderate , but his wife is well known for wearing the Islamic head scarf in public , which offends the military 's rigidly unyielding vision of secularism .
2007_05_01_1844251	5	Army leaders responded to the nomination with an unmistakable threat to overthrow the democratically elected government .
2007_05_01_1844251	6	Turkish democracy has outgrown this kind of army tutelage , which has brought it four military coups since 1960 .
2007_05_01_1844251	7	The European Union has rightly denounced this latest threat .
2007_05_01_1844251	8	But the Bush administration has equivocated .
2007_05_01_1844251	9	Washington needs to tell Turkey 's generals , through diplomatic and NATO channels , that a military coup would have highly damaging consequences .
2007_05_01_1844251	10	While the generals ' threats are out of line , the fears of Turkey 's secularists are real and understandable .
2007_05_01_1844251	11	Turkish citizens , particularly Turkish women , enjoy legal rights , intellectual freedoms and economic opportunities that are regrettably rare elsewhere in the Muslim world .
2007_05_01_1844251	12	Hundreds of thousands of Turks marched this weekend in Istanbul and Ankara to demonstrate their support for secularism and their anxieties about Mr. Gul .
2007_05_01_1844251	13	Mr. Erdogan and Mr. Gul need to address these concerns .
2007_05_01_1844251	14	One useful step would be for Mr. Erdogan 's party to run a more politically and religiously inclusive set of candidates in parliamentary elections , which seem likely later this year .
2007_05_01_1844251	15	During the cold war , Turkey guarded Europe 's frontier against Soviet expansionism .
2007_05_01_1844251	16	Today , it occupies an equally important position as a true Muslim democracy on Europe 's frontier with the Islamic world .
2007_05_01_1844251	17	Washington has a clear interest in helping Turkey keep its democratic balance .
2007_05_01_1844251	18	It needs to leave Turkey 's generals in no doubt where it stands .
2007_05_01_1844252	0	The State of Washington is looking out for students and their families by passing a law requiring textbook companies to disclose prices and other relevant information when they market books to college professors in the state .
2007_05_01_1844252	1	Lawmakers hope that professors who learn the costs upfront will opt for reasonably priced textbooks that cash-strapped students can afford .
2007_05_01_1844252	2	This law , along with similar measures pending in several other states , is a response to intense lobbying by student groups , who have complained for years about the bankrupting cost of college textbooks .
2007_05_01_1844252	3	A 2005 study by the Government Accountability Office found that book costs had nearly tripled over some two decades , thanks in part to pricey but marginally useful CD-ROMs and instructional supplements , as well as the constant issuing of lucrative but little changed new editions -- publishing 's version of planned obsolescence .
2007_05_01_1844252	4	The law is an important first step .
2007_05_01_1844252	5	But to really drive down costs , colleges and universities around the country will need to embrace creative solutions , like the one on display at the online Connexions system at Rice University .
2007_05_01_1844252	6	That content , already in use for several courses at Rice and at other colleges and universities , is generated by a consortium of writers .
2007_05_01_1844252	7	Online use is free .
2007_05_01_1844252	8	And a 300-page hardcover electrical-engineering textbook can be printed out for about $ 25 -- roughly one-fifth the cost of a book from a conventional publisher .
2007_05_01_1844252	9	Other universities should follow Rice 's creative lead .
2007_05_01_1844252	10	Students can use all the help they can get .
2007_05_01_1844253	0	President Dwight Eisenhower established May 1 as Law Day to co-opt the biggest day on the socialist calendar .
2007_05_01_1844253	1	While much of the world marked May Day with critiques of capitalism and parades celebrating working men and women , the United States would honor , President Eisenhower declared , the '' national dedication to the principle of government under laws . ''
2007_05_01_1844253	2	Despite its propagandistic beginnings , a day set aside to honor the rule of law was not a bad idea .
2007_05_01_1844253	3	On the first Law Day , in 1958 , Gov. Averell Harriman of New York attacked Gov. Orval Faubus of Arkansas for blocking integration .
2007_05_01_1844253	4	His fight to keep black children out of the Little Rock Central High School '' offends the concept of law on which our society is based , '' Harriman insisted .
2007_05_01_1844253	5	Law Day proved to be a boon to international law , which was seen during the cold war as a check on communism .
2007_05_01_1844253	6	In his proclamation creating the holiday , Eisenhower emphasized law 's role '' in the settlement of international disputes . ''
2007_05_01_1844253	7	On Law Day 1959 , Senator Prescott Bush of Connecticut , grandfather of the current president , urged , remarkably , that international conflicts be settled by the World Court .
2007_05_01_1844253	8	While the Soviet threat loomed , Law Day attracted a sizable following .
2007_05_01_1844253	9	In 1961 , a headline in The Times reported , '' 100,000 Law Day Celebrations Take Place Throughout Nation . ''
2007_05_01_1844253	10	But as the cold war waned , so did Law Day .
2007_05_01_1844253	11	It is marked today most notably by the American Bar Association , and it is perilously close to becoming a celebration of lawyers .
2007_05_01_1844253	12	As long as there was a national consensus about the importance of the rule of law , Law Day felt superfluous , like celebrating gravity .
2007_05_01_1844253	13	But for six years now , the rule of law has been under attack .
2007_05_01_1844253	14	An array of doctrines has emerged to undermine it , like the enemy combatant doctrine , which says people can be held indefinitely without trial , and the unitary executive doctrine , which insists that a president can do as he wants in many areas , no matter what Congress says .
2007_05_01_1844253	15	In keeping with tradition , President Bush has issued a proclamation inviting Americans today to '' celebrate the Constitution and the laws that protect our rights and liberties . ''
2007_05_01_1844253	16	It rings more than a little hollow , though , as he continues to trample on civil liberties in the war on terror , and stands by an attorney general who has politicized the Justice Department to a shocking degree .
2007_05_01_1844253	17	The less committed a president is to the law , the more need there is for Law Day , which makes it a holiday whose time has come .
2007_05_01_1844254	0	To the Editor : In '' China Needs an Einstein .
2007_05_01_1844254	1	So Do We '' ( column , April 27 ) , Thomas L. Friedman writes that '' if Einstein were alive today , he would be telling both America and China that they have homework to do . ''
2007_05_01_1844254	2	I suggest that a starting assignment might be to turn off the television for little children and read out loud to them , and give them open-ended questions and see what they come up with .
2007_05_01_1844254	3	Questions like '' What makes the sky blue ? ''
2007_05_01_1844254	4	or '' Why does the grass grow up ? ''
2007_05_01_1844254	5	or '' What is inside of a tire when it becomes flat ? ''
2007_05_01_1844254	6	Kids notice things like this , even ask these questions .
2007_05_01_1844254	7	With the TV on , kids , passively entertained , are n't as apt to be as curious .
2007_05_01_1844254	8	The assignment for adults would be to encourage wonderment .
2007_05_01_1844254	9	Who knows , the children might awaken intellectual curiosity in the adults .
2007_05_01_1844254	10	Beverly L. Nelson Richmond , Va. , April 27 , 2007 To the Editor : Once again , Thomas L. Friedman is right on target , this time linking freedom with creative science .
2007_05_01_1844254	11	As a children 's science book author known for innovative ways to get kids into science , I grieve that my kind of book is so hard to sell to publishers when they make so much more money on celebrity books .
2007_05_01_1844254	12	I have heard from several sources that we will be facing a shortage of skilled workers in science and math unless we start now getting kids interested in science and all of its creative possibilities .
2007_05_01_1844254	13	Einstein may be intellectually out of reach for most children , but bring science into a kid 's world and show kids how to think like scientists , and a light goes on in their eyes .
2007_05_01_1844254	14	I know because I see it all the time .
2007_05_01_1844254	15	Vicki Cobb White Plains , April 27 , 2007 To the Editor : As a sophomore in high school , I can say that I have a genuine love for learning .
2007_05_01_1844254	16	But too often it becomes a thoughtless process with rote memorization where I simply cram for tests and then discard the information .
2007_05_01_1844254	17	Instead of learning for the sake of the knowledge , I 'm learning because I want to see A 's on my report card .
2007_05_01_1844254	18	If America wants to foster an Einstein , as Thomas L. Friedman suggests , there needs to be less glorification of the perfect report card and SAT scores and a greater appreciation for the less obvious and more creative forms of intelligence that ca n't be measured by filling in the bubbles of an answer sheet .

2007_05_01_1844255	0	To the Editor : '' Still Waiting for Answers '' ( editorial , April 29 ) demands Congressional investigations into the administration 's use of suspect intelligence before the invasion of Iraq .
2007_05_01_1844255	1	These investigations , for the purpose of informing the American people , are probably the only way to end this catastrophic war .
2007_05_01_1844255	2	After four years of spiraling death and destruction , the Bush administration and Congressional Republicans absurdly deny reality in Iraq .
2007_05_01_1844255	3	Only the forceful opposition of a broad majority of Americans from across the political spectrum can end the conflict .
2007_05_01_1844255	4	That forceful opposition will emerge when Americans are fully informed about the depth of the deceptions that brought us to war .
2007_05_01_1844255	5	Ken Swensen Pound Ridge , N.Y. , April 29 , 2007 To the Editor : So now we add George J. Tenet , the former director of central intelligence , to the ever-growing list of former Bush administration officials and accomplices finally coming clean about manufacturing the phony case for war with Iraq in a desperate effort to avoid forever being tainted by the stain of the Bush legacy .
2007_05_01_1844255	6	No doubt these faux patriots are counting on history to overlook the fact that they waited to do so until after the 2004 election -- long after President Bush 's incompetence and duplicity were clear to many and when it was too late for the country to change course .

2007_05_01_1844255	13	Andrew Davison Poughkeepsie , N.Y. , April 28 , 2007 To the Editor : President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney have responded to Congressional action meant to bring an end to the Iraq war in ways that are petty , petulant and unprincipled .
2007_05_01_1844255	14	This war was entered into on fictional grounds , but it 's real lives , both American and Iraqi , that are destroyed .
2007_05_01_1844255	15	We have elections in the United States so that the people , who are sovereign , can instruct their representatives .
2007_05_01_1844255	16	In November 2006 , they told their elected designates to end the war in Iraq .
2007_05_01_1844255	17	The administration , confusing itself with an emperor , believes that it need not listen .
2007_05_01_1844255	18	This is unacceptable to me as the president 's and vice president 's employer .
2007_05_01_1844255	19	Liane Ellison Norman Pittsburgh , April 27 , 2007 To the Editor : Re '' Quiet Bush Aide Seeks Iraq Czar , Creating a Stir '' ( front page , April 30 ) : The idea of a war czar for Iraq can not be one of Stephen J. Hadley 's better proposals .
2007_05_01_1844255	20	It is transparently an attempt to find a scapegoat for the disaster that is Iraq these days .
2007_05_01_1844255	21	If President Bush actually needs somebody to keep him abreast of developments in Iraq , even on a daily basis , he already has Gen. David H. Petraeus , the commander of United States forces in Iraq .
2007_05_01_1844255	22	And he has Adm. William J. Fallon , the chief of the Central Command ; Gen. Peter Pace , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff ; Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates ; and his national security adviser , Mr. Hadley .
2007_05_01_1844255	23	This is not to mention the director of intelligence .
2007_05_01_1844255	24	To interpose a war czar between the president and these men is obviously not conducive to making the critical judgments it is the commander in chief 's responsibility to make daily .
2007_05_01_1844255	25	At bottom , the president , as commander in chief , is the war czar .
2007_05_01_1844255	26	There is no evading this responsibility .
2007_05_01_1844255	27	Mariano Patalinjug Yonkers , April 30 , 2007 To the Editor : I 'm a bit confused about Stephen J. Hadley 's remark about the Iraq czar he 's trying to find .
2007_05_01_1844255	28	In a recent interview he said , '' What we need is someone with a lot of stature within the government who can make things happen . ''

2007_05_01_1844256	1	It shows what is missing in the current debate about Iran .
2007_05_01_1844256	2	Even moderates like Senator Barack Obama say that the United States should '' never take the military option off the table '' but that '' our first line of offense '' against Iran 's suspected nuclear weapons program should be '' ratcheting up the economic pressure . ''
2007_05_01_1844256	3	But this coercive diplomacy will fail , because countries like Iran seek nuclear weapons to counter insecurity and isolation .
2007_05_01_1844256	4	Then we will be left with a disastrous war .
2007_05_01_1844256	5	All Americans have heard accusations that Iran supports terrorism , but few have heard Iranian concerns that we protect the Iranian opposition group Mujahedeen-e-Khalq , a group the State Department itself has listed as a terrorist organization .
2007_05_01_1844256	6	It is past time to end the Bush administration 's failed policy of regime change and its nuclear double standard .
2007_05_01_1844256	7	Meanwhile , Congress must pass legislation forbidding the president to attack Iran without specific Congressional authorization .

2007_05_01_1844257	3	Of those low-income seniors who make just enough to be ineligible for Medicaid but who lack access to employer-sponsored supplemental coverage , 54 percent of Latinos and 38 percent of African-Americans choose Medicare Advantage .

2007_05_01_1844257	6	This is an immoral dichotomy ; not only do we advocate for continued funding of Medicare , Medicare Savings Programs and Medicare Advantage , but we also advocate passionately for universal quality health care .

2007_05_01_1844265	0	Gov. Tim Kaine of Virginia closed a loophole Monday in the state 's gun laws that allowed a mentally disturbed Virginia Tech student to buy the guns used in a shooting rampage that left 33 dead at the university on April 16 .
2007_05_01_1844265	1	The governor issued an executive order intended to prohibit the sale of guns to anyone found to be dangerous and forced to undergo involuntary mental health treatment .
2007_05_01_1844265	2	Under the order , their names would be included a database of people banned from buying guns .
2007_05_01_1844265	3	In December 2005 , a Virginia judge directed Seung-Hui Cho , the gunman in the massacre , to undergo outpatient treatment .
2007_05_01_1844265	4	But because Mr. Cho was treated as an outpatient , Virginia did not send his name to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System .
2007_05_01_1844265	5	Only 22 states submit any mental health records to the federal database .
2007_05_01_1844265	6	Federal gun laws depend on the states for enforcement , and the failure of Virginia to flag Mr. Cho has raised growing questions about the adequacy of background checks to scrutinize potential gun buyers .
2007_05_01_1844265	7	The governor said the database '' should include any determination that someone is mentally ill and so dangerous to himself or others as to warrant involuntary treatment . ''
2007_05_01_1844265	8	The governor also instructed the State Police to request orders for involuntary inpatient care and involuntary outpatient care from district courts and to include that information in the database . ''
2007_05_01_1844265	9	We realized that this is something we can fix right now and that we need n't wait to fix it , '' Mr. Kaine said in a news conference .
2007_05_01_1844265	10	He added that he hoped his move would encourage other states to tighten their mental health restrictions on gun buyers . ''
2007_05_01_1844265	11	We were all very surprised to find that despite a federal prohibition on purchase of weapons by the mentally ill that dates back to the 1960s , '' Mr. Kaine said , '' the majority of states report no data on mental health adjudications in the national database . ''
2007_05_01_1844265	12	Even in states with these stricter mental health restrictions , gun buyers can sidestep background checks by obtaining firearms from a private seller or at a gun show from a '' private '' individual or '' collector . ''
2007_05_01_1844265	13	Those purchases account for about half of the guns sold in the United States each year .
2007_05_01_1844265	14	Efforts by Virginia lawmakers to close this gun-show loophole have been repeatedly blocked by gun-rights advocates .
2007_05_01_1844266	0	He swore off beer , had to put the pricey organic bananas back on the supermarket shelf and squeezed four meals out of a single chicken , all in the name of reducing hunger .
2007_05_01_1844266	1	And this is not even an election year .
2007_05_01_1844266	2	Gov. Theodore R. Kulongoski 's decision to live on $ 3 a day in grocery money for a week , as he had been urged to do in an Oregon '' food stamp challenge , '' could confound the surest cynic .
2007_05_01_1844266	3	At 66 , he was just elected to his second term , with a budget surplus surpassing $ 1 billion and a legislature controlled by his fellow Democrats .
2007_05_01_1844266	4	So just what was there to gain politically ?
2007_05_01_1844266	5	For a governor who has long pushed to reduce hunger and happens to like eating peanut butter and jelly sandwiches , maybe that was not the point .
2007_05_01_1844266	6	As Wayne Scott , the leader of the House Republicans , put it : '' Obviously I 'm in the opposite party , so it would be easy for me to knock him for this .
2007_05_01_1844266	7	Now , I do n't know that I fully believe that he 's eating on $ 21 a week , but I do think he 's trying to bring attention to the food stamp issue .
2007_05_01_1844266	8	He 's a pretty straight shooter . ''
2007_05_01_1844266	9	Mr. Kulongoski , who said he had not tried to skirt a strict limit of $ 21 for the week -- the average amount allowed Oregon food stamp recipients -- claimed that his only goal had been to raise awareness of hunger here and of a need for the federal government to preserve the current level of stamp benefits .
2007_05_01_1844266	10	Along the way , however , the governor , little known outside the state , also raised awareness of himself .
2007_05_01_1844266	11	News organizations across the country picked up coverage of his shopping expedition to his local grocery store , where he was guided by a state worker who had temporarily relied on food stamps .
2007_05_01_1844266	12	Calls came in from Europe .
2007_05_01_1844266	13	Hundreds of people sent e-mail messages to the main sponsor of the challenge , the Oregon Food Bank , saying they too had been inspired to give it a try .
2007_05_01_1844266	14	By the end of the week , not only had Mr. Kulongoski 's relatively spare entry on Wikipedia been updated to reflect the developments , there was also a sense that the 5-foot-9 , 155-pound governor had set a high standard for other elected leaders who profess to care about the needy .
2007_05_01_1844266	15	In Washington , the House Hunger Caucus asked members of Congress to undertake a similar challenge in May .
2007_05_01_1844266	16	Closer to home , Mr. Kulongoski noted , one of his West Coast counterparts would have a particularly tough act to follow . ''
2007_05_01_1844266	17	I think Arnold probably has a larger caloric intake than I do , '' he said .
2007_05_01_1844266	18	Mr. Kulongoski has made hunger an issue since he was first elected in 2002 .
2007_05_01_1844266	19	That fall , he said in an interview , he was surprised to learn that Oregon ranked high on the list of what the Department of Agriculture used to call hunger and now calls '' food insecurity . ''
2007_05_01_1844266	20	Oregon 's timber and agricultural industries had long been struggling , driving up unemployment , and the high-tech boom that had benefited places like Portland had started to unravel .
2007_05_01_1844266	21	Since then , the state has fallen lower on the list , thanks to an improving economy and federal policies that allow it to expand eligibility for food stamps , said Michael Leachman , a policy analyst for the Oregon Center for Public Policy , which advocates for lower-income people .
2007_05_01_1844266	22	Still , Oregon continues to have a higher unemployment rate , at 5.2 percent , than that of the country as a whole , 4.4 percent .
2007_05_01_1844266	23	High-tech jobs are growing again in Portland , but the timber industry continues to decline . ''
2007_05_01_1844266	24	We have a very pronounced rural-urban split , '' said William Lunch , a professor of political science at Oregon State University .
2007_05_01_1844266	25	Under a farm bill now before Congress , advocates for the hungry say , the rules that allow expanded eligibility for food stamps could be restricted , potentially disqualifying about 50,000 of the 434,000 Oregonians who use them .
2007_05_01_1844266	26	On Friday , Mr. Kulongoski sent a letter to President Bush asking him to preserve the current benefits .
2007_05_01_1844266	27	The governor , a former labor lawyer , state insurance commissioner , state attorney general and member of the Oregon Supreme Court , noted more than once during his week on the low-cost diet that he grew up an orphan in a Catholic boys home in St. Louis .
2007_05_01_1844266	28	He said Friday that he had learned to clean his plate no matter what was on it .
2007_05_01_1844266	29	With Mr. Kulongoski and his wife , Mary Oberst , limited to $ 42 between them , what was on the plate became distinctly familiar .
2007_05_01_1844266	30	Ms. Oberst , who typically does their cooking -- the governor has no kitchen staff -- released a to-the-penny menu midway through the week that showed a single chicken surfacing first with zucchini on the side , and then later in salad and a '' chowder . ''
2007_05_01_1844266	31	[ The couple returned to their regular diet on Sunday afternoon .
2007_05_01_1844266	32	In a brief telephone interview on Monday , the governor said that eating less had clearly affected him . ''
2007_05_01_1844266	33	I went to bed earlier , '' he said , '' because I was tired at the end of the day . ''
2007_05_01_1844266	34	He also said he had missed his stash of Northwest microbrews . ]
2007_05_01_1844266	35	How much do the Kulongoskis usually spend on food ?
2007_05_01_1844266	36	The governor 's office puts it at just $ 55 a week , but that is for at-home meals only .
2007_05_01_1844266	37	Not included are things they eschewed during the challenge : meals at official functions , dinners out , and lunches and snacks bought on the job .
2007_05_01_1844266	38	For all the public fascination with the governor 's menu , there did not appear to be immediate benefits for his policy agenda .
2007_05_01_1844266	39	Mr. Kulongoski 's proposal to provide health insurance to children by raising the cigarette tax failed in an initial vote during the week , though he said he believed that it would pass before the legislature adjourns in June .
2007_05_01_1844266	40	His plan to expand financing for community colleges has also stalled for now .
2007_05_01_1844266	41	Asked if his lean week had bolstered his political heft , he said : '' I do n't think it makes any difference .
2007_05_01_1844266	42	I 've been in this for 35 years , and these things all pass .
2007_05_01_1844266	43	Next week they may not remember me being on the diet , but something will stay in the mind about hunger in Oregon . ''
2007_05_01_1844267	0	The Department of Education has begun a citywide survey of more than 1.8 million parents , students and teachers concerning their attitudes about the public schools , Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Chancellor Joel I. Klein announced yesterday .
2007_05_01_1844267	1	The $ 2 million effort is part of the Children First initiative , in which each school will receive a report card with a standard school grade , A through F. Data from the surveys will account for 10 percent of each school 's grade .
2007_05_01_1844267	2	The Learning Environment Surveys are being mailed with postage-paid return envelopes to parents of middle school and high school students and are being sent home with elementary school children for their parents to fill out .
2007_05_01_1844267	3	Students in the 6th through 12th grades and teachers at all grade levels will get their surveys at school .
2007_05_01_1844267	4	The parents , teachers and students invited to participate may also fill out the forms online at schools.nyc.gov / surveys .
2007_05_01_1844267	5	The deadline is May 18 .
2007_05_01_1844267	6	The survey is intended to produce '' hard facts about which schools are succeeding and which schools are falling behind , '' Mr. Bloomberg said at a news conference at Public School 76 in the Bronx . .
2007_05_01_1844267	7	For assessments of the results , the tentative plan is to give slightly more weight to the parents ' responses , officials said .
2007_05_01_1844267	8	The parents ' survey consists of 14 multiple-choice questions , most of them about how much the respondents agree or disagree with statements about school quality , activities , course work and teacher support .
2007_05_01_1844267	9	Examples vary from '' I feel welcome in my child 's school '' to '' Students use alcohol or illegal drugs during school . ''
2007_05_01_1844267	10	The survey also presents parents with a list of 10 potential improvements , including more teacher training and smaller classes , and asks them to choose the ones they consider most important .
2007_05_01_1844267	11	Students are quizzed on similar topics , with agree-or-disagree statements like '' My teachers inspire me to learn '' and '' Most students in my school like to put others down . ''
2007_05_01_1844267	12	Even before Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Klein 's announcement , a group of eight parents was urging the public to snub the survey .
2007_05_01_1844267	13	The parents , who were members of the focus groups that the Department of Education assembled to help them fine-tune the survey , said the questions ignore their concerns about class size , standardized testing and school leadership teams .
2007_05_01_1844267	14	The group urged parents to cross out the questions and send back the form with a handwritten message demanding '' real parent input . ''
2007_05_01_1844267	15	Mr. Bloomberg said the group had found a way to '' subvert the system and sit around and complain and not make it any better . ''
2007_05_01_1844267	16	Randi Weingarten , the president of the United Federation of Teachers , said she welcomed the survey . ''
2007_05_01_1844267	17	We want to make sure that we know on the ground what people really think about the schools , '' she said . .
2007_05_01_1844267	18	The department has had trouble getting parents to return similar questionnaires , including recent requests for information about discounted lunches and school bus service . ''
2007_05_01_1844267	19	The survey will only be as good as the people who participate in it , '' Mr. Klein said .
2007_05_01_1844268	0	One of the men suspected in last month 's murder and dismemberment of a Staten Island woman in Panama has been returned to his native Colombia by Costa Rica despite being one of Panama 's most wanted men , the authorities in Panama and Costa Rica said yesterday .
2007_05_01_1844268	1	The man , Camilo Castro , was arrested in Costa Rica on April 17 for entering that country illegally , the chief of the Costa Rican Special Migration Police , Francisco Castaing , told reporters .
2007_05_01_1844268	2	Mr. Castro is one of two suspects sought in the death of Toni Grossi Abrams , 56 , a Staten Island businesswoman with real estate in Panama .
2007_05_01_1844268	3	Her butchered and burned remains were found in Panama City on April 10 .
2007_05_01_1844268	4	Interpol had been told that Mr. Castro was wanted in Panama , said Rafael Ruiz , a spokesman for the Panamanian Public Ministry .
2007_05_01_1844268	5	But instead of detaining him , Costa Rican authorities deported him to Colombia on Friday , Mr. Castaing said .
2007_05_01_1844268	6	Mr. Castaing told reporters that Costa Rica had never been notified by Panama that there was an arrest warrant for Mr. Castro and that he was returned to Colombia in accordance with Costa Rica 's normal immigration procedures .
2007_05_01_1844268	7	Panama plans to ask Colombia to extradite Mr. Castro , Mr. Ruiz said , adding that while in the past Colombia has extradited its citizens to Panama to face drug charges , there seemed to be no precedent for murder cases .
2007_05_01_1844268	8	Shortly after Ms. Abrams 's death , an American tenant of hers , Debra Ann Ridgley , was arrested and charged in her killing .
2007_05_01_1844268	9	But Panamanian prosecutors have said that Mr. Castro and Didier Osorio Garcia , another Colombian who befriended Ms. Ridgley , were with her in Ms. Abrams 's apartment the night of her death , and that the two men helped Ms. Ridgley dispose of the body .
2007_05_01_1844268	10	Mr. Garcia remains at large .
2007_05_01_1844268	11	Seth Redlich , a cousin of Ms. Abrams 's who lives in Panama and has been working to solve her killing , said he hoped Colombia would undo what appeared to be the error that set Mr. Castro free . ''
2007_05_01_1844268	12	It 's inexcusable that this man has simply been allowed to walk out of the country and been delivered to Colombia a free man , '' Mr. Redlich said .
2007_05_01_1844270	0	SOMEBODY keeps knocking Jesus off his pedestal outside St. Martin of Tours Church in the Bronx .
2007_05_01_1844270	1	This time , vandals streaked the face with black marker and wrote '' devil '' and '' 666 , '' and the half-smashed statue spent most of last week propped up against the pedestal as if recovering from a dizzy spell .
2007_05_01_1844270	2	Folks in the Crotona neighborhood are reeling , too .
2007_05_01_1844270	3	This statue has been a backdrop to wedding , baptism and first communion photos for generations .
2007_05_01_1844270	4	It is the site of countless silent prayers or rapid signs of the cross for passers-by .
2007_05_01_1844270	5	Everyone insists the statue will reclaim its rightful place in their hearts and neighborhood .
2007_05_01_1844270	6	Just how is more complicated .
2007_05_01_1844270	7	Several parishioners -- no doubt speaking from experience with robberies at homes they now secure with bars , chains and alarms -- suggested putting Jesus on lockdown . ''
2007_05_01_1844270	8	You are not going to put my Jesus in a cage ! ''
2007_05_01_1844270	9	said the Rev. John Flynn , the pastor of the Roman Catholic parish . ''
2007_05_01_1844270	10	Do n't you dare think that .
2007_05_01_1844270	11	He has got to be out there by himself .
2007_05_01_1844270	12	We are not going to hide him . ''
2007_05_01_1844270	13	On Good Friday evening , vandals pried the fiberglass statue off its pedestal , tossing it and a knife onto the dirt .
2007_05_01_1844270	14	Parishioners cleaned it off and glued it back on the pedestal .
2007_05_01_1844270	15	On April 23 , the statue was knocked down , defaced and thrown face down , its right shoulder smashed and its red robes chipped .
2007_05_01_1844270	16	Nancy Padilla and some friends were at a prayer meeting when a parishioner they know only as El Mexicanito -- '' the Little Mexican Guy '' -- burst in to say that the statue had been robbed . ''
2007_05_01_1844270	17	Everyone rushed outside , '' she said . ''
2007_05_01_1844270	18	We looked over the wall and there it was .
2007_05_01_1844270	19	That 's when we saw the arm was broken .
2007_05_01_1844270	20	I told El Mexicanito to get some water to wash it .
2007_05_01_1844270	21	But the three sixes did not come out .
2007_05_01_1844270	22	Demons must have done this . ''
2007_05_01_1844270	23	Actually , there are whispers in the neighborhood that a group of young men who play handball and smoke and sell whatever they can in a nearby park may know more than a little about the crime .
2007_05_01_1844270	24	Some of them have '' 666 '' tattoos , said one person who saw them often in the park .
2007_05_01_1844270	25	Often , that is , until last week , when they made themselves scarce .
2007_05_01_1844270	26	The police are investigating .
2007_05_01_1844270	27	People are praying , and painting .
2007_05_01_1844270	28	By Sunday , volunteers had restored the statue .
2007_05_01_1844270	29	And they glued it down , yet again .
2007_05_01_1844270	30	Delia Mojica , the director of religious education at the parish , passed by the statue a few days ago , carrying a book titled '' God 's Law Guides Us . ''
2007_05_01_1844270	31	Obviously , somebody had differed .
2007_05_01_1844270	32	How could someone be so mean ? ''
2007_05_01_1844270	33	I do n't think it was somebody in their right mind . ''
2007_05_01_1844270	34	A man sidled up to her , peered over the top of his glasses and shook his head . ''
2007_05_01_1844270	35	They need to make a cage , '' he said . ''
2007_05_01_1844271	0	When a jury acquitted Carl J. Marlinga , a former county prosecutor from suburban Detroit , of bribery charges last year , his initial reaction was to write off the episode as a terrible mistake that at least had been corrected . ''
2007_05_01_1844271	1	Prosecutors can make mistakes for innocent reasons , '' Mr. Marlinga said . ''
2007_05_01_1844271	2	I know that first hand . ''
2007_05_01_1844271	3	But as he looks back at the case , Mr. Marlinga , 60 , who was charged while he was a Democratic candidate for Congress , no longer has such confidence in the integrity of the legal system . ''
2007_05_01_1844271	4	Was there some extra pressure on the United States attorney 's office , whether articulated or tacitly understood , by their superiors in Washington who would not look favorably upon the office if this case was not pursued ? ''
2007_05_01_1844271	5	I have to wonder . ''
2007_05_01_1844271	6	That kind of second guessing has surfaced with increasing frequency in recent weeks in states including Alabama , Maryland , Michigan , New Jersey , Pennsylvania and Wisconsin .
2007_05_01_1844271	7	Since the dismissals of eight United States attorneys , local lawyers , politicians , editorial writers , members of Congress and defendants are questioning what they say is a pattern of investigating Democrats .
2007_05_01_1844271	8	They point to inquiries that drag on for years but end with no charges , an acquittal or convictions for relatively modest infractions .
2007_05_01_1844271	9	The Justice Department does not keep statistics on the political parties of the subjects of its corruption investigations , officials said , so there is no comprehensive way to determine the breakdown or whether the cases disproportionately involve Democrats .
2007_05_01_1844271	10	Department officials point out that several prominent Republicans have been prosecuted in recent years , including former Representatives Randy Cunningham of California and Bob Ney of Ohio .
2007_05_01_1844271	11	Some critics , though , are suggesting that the department dismissed some prosecutors to squelch corruption investigations of Republicans , while encouraging other prosecutors to go after Democrats . ''
2007_05_01_1844271	12	Democrats do occupy most public offices in Allegheny County , '' Thomas J. Farrell , a former federal prosecutor in Western Pennsylvania , wrote recently in The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette , referring to investigations of the former Pittsburgh mayor , the sheriff 's office and the area medical examiner . ''
2007_05_01_1844271	13	But are the Republican officials in the 24 other counties of the Western Pennsylvania District all squeaky clean ? ''
2007_05_01_1844271	14	Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales , along with other senior Justice Department officials and prosecutors , has rejected the criticism . ''
2007_05_01_1844271	15	We 've prosecuted members of Congress , we 've prosecuted governors , Republicans , and so this notion that somehow we 're playing politics with the cases we bring , it 's just not true , '' Mr. Gonzales told the Senate Judiciary Committee on April 19 .
2007_05_01_1844271	16	In Eastern Michigan since 2001 , at least 21 Democratic public officials have been charged or linked to corruption inquiries , including the governor , the mayor of Detroit and several local officials , including Mr. Marlinga .
2007_05_01_1844271	17	Officials at the United States attorney 's office in Detroit identified one Republican who had been charged and said they did not have a list by party that would allow them to identify others .
2007_05_01_1844271	18	Some of those Michigan cases resulted in convictions on significant charges .
2007_05_01_1844271	19	They included a member of the Pontiac City Council who pleaded guilty to taking a bribe from F.B.I. agents posing as local businessmen , a Detroit councilman convicted of fraud , and a former Wayne County official convicted of accepting gifts from a Detroit airport contractor .
2007_05_01_1844271	20	On the other hand , several cases resulted in acquittals or no charges being filed , or convictions on relatively minor offenses .
2007_05_01_1844271	21	A Wayne County lawyer who pleaded guilty in 2004 to a misdemeanor charge , for example , used an intern to enter data on potential Democratic political donors for the pending governor 's race .
2007_05_01_1844271	22	In Mr. Marlinga 's case , the State Republican Party and his Republican opponent in the House race filed complaints asking for an investigation .
2007_05_01_1844271	23	The charges centered on a legal motion by Mr. Marlinga , while serving his fifth elected term as county prosecutor , to the State Supreme Court in 2002 agreeing that it should re-examine a decade-old rape case .
2007_05_01_1844271	24	He had doubts about the case because an orthodontist who had appeared as an expert witness -- testifying that there was at least a 3 million to 1 chance that a bite mark on the victim came from someone other than the suspect -- had since been discredited .
2007_05_01_1844271	25	A second expert witness had recanted her testimony .
2007_05_01_1844271	26	The testimony was crucial to the prosecution , and Mr. Marlinga said he felt morally obligated to notify the Supreme Court of his doubts .
2007_05_01_1844271	27	The convicted man was later acquitted , after the Supreme Court agreed that he should be retried .
2007_05_01_1844271	28	But Mr. Marlinga 's request to review the case nearly ended his career as a lawyer .
2007_05_01_1844271	29	Several days before he filed it , he attended a holiday party where he solicited campaign contributions for his Congressional race , including a $ 2,000 donation from a real estate agent who employed the sister of the convicted man .
2007_05_01_1844271	30	Mr. Marlinga knew that the real estate agent -- who had no financial or family relationship with the rape suspect -- believed that the man deserved a new trial .
2007_05_01_1844271	31	Mr. Marlinga said he saw no issue with accepting the donation , because he had decided months earlier to file the brief .
2007_05_01_1844271	32	When Republicans learned of the contribution , they asked the authorities to investigate if it might have been a bribe . ''
2007_05_01_1844271	33	It seemed to me it was worthwhile to take a look at this , '' said Rusty Hill , then chairman of the State Republican Party .
2007_05_01_1844271	34	Stephen J. Murphy , the United States attorney in Detroit since 2005 , defended his office 's handling of the case . ''
2007_05_01_1844271	35	There was no political calculus that went into that prosecution , '' Mr. Murphy said in an interview .
2007_05_01_1844271	36	When Mr. Marlinga testified , the case quickly fell apart , jurors said . ''
2007_05_01_1844271	37	It seemed like they were trying to build a case with really nothing to stand on , '' Susan Kramer , a teacher in Rochester , Mich. , said in an interview .
2007_05_01_1844271	38	Ms. Kramer said that she and other jurors thought Mr. Marlinga had been treated so unfairly that they wrote him a letter and invited him to dinner . ''
2007_05_01_1844271	39	We felt that he had really been run through the mill , '' she said . ''
2007_05_01_1844271	40	He deserved to know that we did n't just feel that he was not guilty , but that he was truly innocent . ''
2007_05_01_1844271	41	By then , Mr. Marlinga had long since lost his race for Congress , and stepped down from his job as county prosecutor .
2007_05_01_1844271	42	Other cases across the country have also provoked questions .
2007_05_01_1844271	43	In Alabama last week , an editorial in The Decatur Daily asked if charges against former Gov. Donald E. Siegelman , a Democrat , were motivated by politics .
2007_05_01_1844271	44	The state attorney general , a Republican , began an investigation of Mr. Siegelman weeks after he took office in 1999 .
2007_05_01_1844271	45	The attorney general eventually teamed up with the United States attorney , who failed to convict Mr. Siegelman of Medicaid fraud .
2007_05_01_1844271	46	In 2005 , after Mr. Siegelman had left office and was running again for governor , federal prosecutors charged him with taking bribes from the chairman of a hospital company in exchange for a seat on a state board that approves hospital construction .
2007_05_01_1844271	47	Prosecutors did not show that Mr. Siegelman benefited personally from the money ; it went to a campaign he set up to promote the creation of a state lottery to finance education .
2007_05_01_1844271	48	But he was found guilty on 7 of 33 charges , including one bribery count , a conviction he is appealing .
2007_05_01_1844271	49	Tom Wright , executive editor of The Decatur Daily , said the case looked to him like a witch hunt against a Democrat . ''
2007_05_01_1844271	50	Their conviction just does n't seem right , '' Mr. Wright said in an interview . ''
2007_05_01_1844271	51	It appears they were looking for ways to get him . ''
2007_05_01_1844271	52	In Wisconsin , the United States attorney , Steven M. Biskupic , has come under fire for bringing charges against a former state employee , Georgia Thompson .
2007_05_01_1844271	53	She was convicted on charges involving directing a state travel contract to a firm linked to Gov. James E. Doyle , a Democrat .
2007_05_01_1844271	54	But a three-judge panel overturned the conviction in early April , and freed her from prison .
2007_05_01_1844271	55	One judge called the evidence '' beyond thin . ''
2007_05_01_1844271	56	Six Democratic senators have asked the Justice Department to explain why it brought the case .
2007_05_01_1844271	57	And in Pennsylvania , Democratic Party officials and Mr. Farrell , the former federal prosecutor , are questioning if Mary Beth Buchanan , the United States attorney there , has tried to impress her bosses in Washington by investigating Democrats .
2007_05_01_1844271	58	Her office spent more than two years looking into whether former Mayor Tom Murphy of Pittsburgh , offered firefighters a favorable labor contract in exchange for their endorsement .
2007_05_01_1844271	59	After Mr. Murphy left office , Ms. Buchanan announced she would not indict him .
2007_05_01_1844271	60	She did not pursue charges against a Republican state legislator , Jeffrey E. Habay , or former Senator Rick Santorum , when they were accused of wrongdoing , Mr. Farrell said .
2007_05_01_1844271	61	Ms. Buchanan said the questions about Mr. Santorum -- which related to where he claimed residency -- have been referred to officials in Washington .
2007_05_01_1844271	62	More broadly , she said , Democrats outnumber Republicans by such a heavy margin in Pittsburgh it is only natural that more Democrats are the subject of investigations .
2007_05_01_1844271	63	What matters , she said , is that each case is handled fairly . ''
2007_05_01_1844271	64	Whenever wrongdoing is brought to my attention , it 's my job to investigate it and where appropriate , I will bring charges , '' she said .
2007_05_01_1844272	0	The woman who faces charges of running a prostitution ring in Washington that serviced the prominent and powerful said Monday that she intended to force many of those clients to testify in her behalf .
2007_05_01_1844272	1	The woman , Deborah Jeane Palfrey , is offering a simple defense to government charges that the escort service she ran for 13 years by telephone from her home in California was actually a straightforward prostitution business .
2007_05_01_1844272	2	Although she promoted her business as a legal '' high-end erotic fantasy service , '' she said it was not intended as an exchange of sex for money .
2007_05_01_1844272	3	She told reporters Monday that her former clients , reported to include a Bush administration economics official and the head of a conservative research group , among others , should confirm that when they are called to testify .
2007_05_01_1844272	4	If any sexual activity occurred , she said , it was not authorized or intended by her but undertaken independently by her female subcontractors and male clients '' who disobeyed my directives , their signed contracts and participated in illegal behavior . ''
2007_05_01_1844272	5	In other words , she is stunned at accusations that sexual activity had taken place between the women who worked for her and the men who paid them about $ 300 for 90 minutes of their attentions .
2007_05_01_1844272	6	Washington residents have been mildly titillated by the case but more than mildly curious about the one obvious question : Who were those powerful clients ?
2007_05_01_1844272	7	As for now , the names of only two have been revealed .
2007_05_01_1844272	8	The most prominent was Randall L. Tobias , a veteran businessman and the top foreign aid adviser in the State Department , who resigned Friday after he acknowledged to ABC News that he was on the list of Ms. Palfrey 's clients .
2007_05_01_1844272	9	The other , disclosed on Ms. Palfrey 's Web site , was Harlan K. Ullman , a Defense Department consultant best known for coining the phrase '' shock and awe '' to describe the intended effect on Iraq of the war 's opening barrage , but the phrase also might well describe his own reaction to being called by reporters on Friday about the disclosure , about which he declined comment .
2007_05_01_1844272	10	Ms. Palfrey says she does not know the actual names of her clients , just their telephone numbers .
2007_05_01_1844272	11	She said she gave them to ABC News without compensation so the network could use its resources to match names to the numbers .
2007_05_01_1844272	12	ABC has used the information to prepare a story to be broadcast this Friday on its show '' 20/20 . ''
2007_05_01_1844272	13	In a promotion for the segment , ABC said on its Web site Monday that the list includes '' a Bush administration economist , the head of a conservative think tank , a prominent C.E.O. , several lobbyists and a handful of military officials '' in addition to Mr. Tobias and Mr. Ullman .
2007_05_01_1844272	14	The network did not identify the customers by name and a spokesman declined to say whether it would do so Friday .
2007_05_01_1844272	15	Mr. Tobias told reporters that he had used the escort service but said he only received massages .
2007_05_01_1844272	16	Ms. Palfrey said Monday that she felt sorry for Mr. Tobias because of the unwanted attention he had received but was gratified that he supported her account that she had not run a sex-for-money service .
2007_05_01_1844272	17	She chided him , however , for choosing not to come forward earlier with his '' extremely valuable exculpatory evidence . ''
2007_05_01_1844272	18	Ms. Palfrey was in United States District Court on Monday to ask Judge Gladys Kessler to replace her court-selected lawyer , A. J. Kramer , the city 's public defender .
2007_05_01_1844272	19	Judge Kessler said that she could choose another local lawyer , but that the court would not pay the costs for her to retain her choice , Herald Price Fahringer , a New York lawyer well known for his defense work in obscenity cases .
2007_05_01_1844272	20	The indictment accuses Ms. Palfrey of engaging more than 100 women from 1993 to 2006 '' for the purpose of engaging in prostitution activity with male clients , including sexual intercourse and oral sex in exchange for money . ''
2007_05_01_1844272	21	She made more than $ 2 million running the operation , known as Pamela Martin and Associates , according to the indictment .
2007_05_01_1844273	0	Gov. Jon S. Corzine apologized to New Jersey residents on Monday as he left the hospital 18 days after being critically injured in a car crash in which he was being driven at 91 miles per hour on the Garden State Parkway while riding without his seat belt . ''
2007_05_01_1844273	1	I set a very bad example , '' said a contrite Mr. Corzine , who broke his left femur , his sternum and 11 ribs in the accident .
2007_05_01_1844273	2	He spoke from a wheelchair just outside Cooper University Hospital in Camden .
2007_05_01_1844273	3	His voice breaking with emotion , he added : '' I hope the state will forgive me .
2007_05_01_1844273	4	I will work very hard to set the right kind of example . ''
2007_05_01_1844273	5	Mr. Corzine , 60 , who spent more than a week on a ventilator and had three operations on his leg , spoke for less than a minute and refused to answer questions from reporters .
2007_05_01_1844273	6	It was his first public comments since the accident , save for telling an Associated Press photographer last week that he felt blessed .
2007_05_01_1844273	7	Wearing a red Cooper T-shirt , black track pants and running shoes , Mr. Corzine thanked his doctors as well as the emergency medical technicians and helicopter pilots who tended to him after the crash and who met with him on Monday before his release .
2007_05_01_1844273	8	His son Jeffrey , 24 , pushed the wheelchair and his daughter , Jennifer Corzine-Pisani , 36 , walked alongside . ''
2007_05_01_1844273	9	I could n't be more grateful for all the support I 've been given from people around the state , '' said the governor , a Democrat in his first term . ''
2007_05_01_1844273	10	I do n't think people realize just how much people care and show their support . ''
2007_05_01_1844273	11	There is nothing more important in life than those people who care about you all the time in the moments of joy and the moments of pain , '' he added .
2007_05_01_1844273	12	After the brief comments , Mr. Corzine was helped into a black GMC Savana van , with tinted windows , which he bought and had specially modified for his wheelchair .
2007_05_01_1844273	13	He left the hospital in a six-car caravan about 1:45 p.m. His vehicle followed a black state police Crown Victoria , and was followed by a Chevrolet Suburban -- like the one he was riding in at the time of the crash -- a Mercedes station wagon , and two other cars .
2007_05_01_1844273	14	The motorcade did not use emergency lights , as it had been just before the accident .
2007_05_01_1844273	15	The governor 's motorcade moved with the flow of traffic on Interstate 295 , at some points sustaining speeds up to 70 miles per hour several minutes at a time , according to the speedometer of a vehicle traveling alongside ; posted limits were 55 and 65 .
2007_05_01_1844273	16	Capt. Al Della Fave , a state police spokesman , said the commander of the executive protection unit , which provides security and drivers for the governor , told him on Monday that the motorcade troopers had been instructed to adhere to posted speed limits .
2007_05_01_1844273	17	He declined to identify the driver of the governor 's van or to make any of the drivers of the motorcade available for an interview .
2007_05_01_1844273	18	The motorcade shed about two cars before arriving about 2:45 p.m. at Drumthwacket , the official residence for New Jersey 's governor , where Mr. Corzine will stay during the next stage of his recovery .
2007_05_01_1844273	19	It remained unclear when Mr. Corzine , who normally lives in Hoboken , would be well enough to resume his official duties , which were being handled by Richard J. Codey , the State Senate president , who has been acting governor since the accident .
2007_05_01_1844273	20	At Drumthwacket , an 1835 Greek Revival mansion on 11 acres , two news helicopters hovered overhead .
2007_05_01_1844273	21	Mr. Corzine 's van was parked at a side entrance out of view of the news cameras on the front lawn , making it impossible to see him leaving the van .
2007_05_01_1844273	22	But one person exiting another car in the motorcade wore blue-gray medical scrubs , perhaps part of the team of nurses and therapists expected to care for the governor in the coming days and weeks .
2007_05_01_1844273	23	The governor 's mansion has been altered in several ways to make him more comfortable for what his aides and doctors expect to be a long and arduous rehabilitation process .
2007_05_01_1844273	24	A portable chairlift has been installed to enable the governor to move easily between the public space of the first floor and the private quarters on the second .
2007_05_01_1844273	25	The outdoor pool will be converted into a heated one for his physical therapy , while rehabilitation equipment has been added to the second-floor gym .
2007_05_01_1844273	26	And video-conferencing equipment is being installed to enable the governor to take part in meetings .
2007_05_01_1844273	27	Anthony Coley , Mr. Corzine 's communications director , said that Mr. Corzine had no public events scheduled so far , and that it was unclear what he would do this week other than rest .
2007_05_01_1844273	28	But the governor did invite about 10 members of his senior staff to Drumthwacket late Monday afternoon , Mr. Coley added . ''
2007_05_01_1844273	29	He 's happy to be home , '' Mr. Coley said .
2007_05_01_1844273	30	At the governor 's first public appearance since the accident , his emergence from the hospital was carefully managed .
2007_05_01_1844273	31	A lectern was taken into the hospital foyer in the late morning , but later taken away , when Mr. Corzine 's aides announced that he would not attempt to walk or stand during his statement .
2007_05_01_1844273	32	( They said last week that he had been able to take a few steps using a walker . )
2007_05_01_1844273	33	Mr. Corzine 's aides rebuffed reporters who asked for the chance to ask him about his recollections of the crash and his plans to return to work .
2007_05_01_1844273	34	They did , however , bow to suggestions from some of the two dozen camera crews on hand and relocated the press conference .
2007_05_01_1844273	35	Photographers had argued that the shadows and low light at the original spot near the hospital entrance might ruin their shots and make Mr. Corzine appear pallid .
2007_05_01_1844273	36	So aides to the governor agreed to locate the press conference a few feet away , where the shade and sun met .
2007_05_01_1844273	37	An X was placed on the pavement with duct tape and one of the governor 's spokesmen , Andrew Poag , sat in a wheelchair to allow the photographers to adjust their camera settings .
2007_05_01_1844273	38	About 100 people gathered to watch the event , including hospital employees , visitors and pedestrians .
2007_05_01_1844273	39	Anne Theochrides , who works in the marketing department of a physical rehabilitation center across the street , said she had closely followed news accounts of Mr. Corzine 's progress during his time in the hospital and wanted to be there as he left . ''
2007_05_01_1844273	40	I was hoping he 'd go to one of our facilities , '' she said . ''
2007_05_01_1844273	41	But I guess he wanted to go home to the mansion where he could do business , too .
2007_05_01_1844273	42	I hope it works out for him . ''
2007_05_01_1844274	0	More than 30 years have passed since Congress banned a broad range of synthetic compounds called PCBs .
2007_05_01_1844274	1	Yet 2.65 million cubic yards of mud on the bottom of the Hudson River remain contaminated with the chemicals , which are considered neurotoxins and probable human carcinogens .
2007_05_01_1844274	2	Since 2002 , General Electric has been under federal order to clean approximately 40 miles of the Hudson where its factories discharged PCBs .
2007_05_01_1844274	3	Preliminary site clearing for the huge project began last week , but actual dredging will not start until 2009 at the earliest .
2007_05_01_1844274	4	Here , on another PCB-contaminated river about 60 miles to the southeast in Massachusetts , G.E. has made more progress , albeit haltingly .
2007_05_01_1844274	5	Working with the federal government , the company completed the cleanup of a two-mile stretch of the Housatonic River late last year , scooping out the heaviest concentrations of the industrial chemicals .
2007_05_01_1844274	6	While much remains to be done along the remaining 100 miles or more of the Housatonic , its most heavily contaminated section is now cleaner than it has been in a long time .
2007_05_01_1844274	7	The two projects differ in scale and expense as much as the two rivers differ in depth and breadth , and each presents unique engineering challenges .
2007_05_01_1844274	8	The Hudson project covers 40 miles of the broad river from which the 2.65 million cubic yards of contaminated sediment will have to be dredged , at an estimated cost of $ 700 million .
2007_05_01_1844274	9	By contrast , the first phase of the cleanup of the Housatonic , a far gentler river , had a price tag of $ 250 million and involved 110,000 cubic yards of mud .
2007_05_01_1844274	10	Still , the Housatonic cleanup dragged on for more than six years , twice the expected time .
2007_05_01_1844274	11	And there is no timetable or cost estimate yet for decontaminating the river 's lower reaches .
2007_05_01_1844274	12	Based on their experience on the Housatonic , scientists , G.E. officials , government authorities and people who live in the local communities affected by PCBs all agree that work on the Hudson , whenever it starts , is likely to take far longer than expected and will run into more technological obstacles than anyone anticipates .
2007_05_01_1844274	13	Almost certainly , the level of public suspicion and mistrust surrounding these projects will not soon subside .
2007_05_01_1844274	14	Peter L. deFur , an environmental consultant who advises local groups concerned about the Housatonic cleanup , said that although the company had belatedly been doing a '' pretty good '' job on the river , the people who live along the Hudson should be warned that '' G.E. has been absolutely the opposite of a responsible party . ''
2007_05_01_1844274	15	Stephen D. Ramsey , G.E. 's vice president for corporate environmental programs , who is overseeing both cleanups , said the company had proved its good faith by spending more than a billion dollars studying and cleaning up PCBs , mostly in these two rivers .
2007_05_01_1844274	16	But he said there is little that G.E. can do to change perceptions '' except to be very clear with the public about what is the status of the project , what people can expect to see and what are the issues we are encountering as we go along . ''
2007_05_01_1844274	17	In the last century , G.E. discovered many profitable ways of using PCBs , or polychlorinated biphenyls , a slippery yellowish goo as thick as motor oil that can resist heat without catching fire .
2007_05_01_1844274	18	G.E. used vast quantities at its Hudson Falls and Fort Edward factories on the Hudson to build electrical capacitors .
2007_05_01_1844274	19	At its sprawling plant here on the Housatonic , G.E. used them in transformers .
2007_05_01_1844274	20	After the chemicals were banned in 1976 , the company agreed to clean up its properties .
2007_05_01_1844274	21	But it argued that the vast quantities of PCBs that had been discharged into the rivers would break down on their own or be harmlessly buried under a protective layer of silt .
2007_05_01_1844274	22	At first the federal Environmental Protection Agency agreed .
2007_05_01_1844274	23	As scientific understanding advanced , however , the agency decided to take a second look .
2007_05_01_1844274	24	Even nestled in the river mud , the chemicals were being ingested by worms and other invertebrates , which were in turn eaten by small fish , and those were eaten by larger ones , which eventually were consumed by people .
2007_05_01_1844274	25	The only ways to solve the problem , the E.P.A. decided in the late 1980s , were to remove or cap the PCBs .
2007_05_01_1844274	26	G.E. spent millions of dollars on advertising trying to convince local residents that dredging was worse than doing nothing , but the company eventually accepted a plan to clean more than 40 miles of the Hudson , from Fort Edward to the Troy dam , in two phases .
2007_05_01_1844274	27	The first phase , a kind of trial run to last one year , was originally set to begin in 2006 but is now set for 2009 .
2007_05_01_1844274	28	The final phase is scheduled to last five years .
2007_05_01_1844274	29	The Housatonic cleanup has a more compact history .
2007_05_01_1844274	30	The 254-acre G.E. plant in Pittsfield used PCBs from 1932 until they were banned .
2007_05_01_1844274	31	Storm water runoff from the plant carried the chemicals into the Housatonic , where they spread downstream , contaminating more than 100 miles of river in Massachusetts and Connecticut .
2007_05_01_1844274	32	In 1999 , G.E. agreed to a $ 250 million settlement to clean a highly contaminated half-mile portion of the river that ran through the company 's property in Pittsfield .
2007_05_01_1844274	33	Because the Housatonic in that area is only a few feet deep and a few yards wide , G.E. could , in essence , dry-clean the river .
2007_05_01_1844274	34	At the end of 1999 , it started work on a temporary dam across half the river , and when that half-mile section of the riverbed dried out , front-end loaders scraped off two feet of mud and dumped it onto trucks to be buried at G.E. 's Pittsfield property .
2007_05_01_1844274	35	The temporary dam was then moved to the other side of the river , where the process was repeated .
2007_05_01_1844274	36	The E.P.A. cleaned the next 1.5 miles of river itself , billing G.E. for half the cost .
2007_05_01_1844274	37	The agency chose to divert the Housatonic through a large pipe and then bring in heavy equipment to scrape the river bottom .
2007_05_01_1844274	38	G.E. had other PCB problems in Pittsfield .
2007_05_01_1844274	39	Over the years , the company had given away PCB-soaked dirt and other material that property owners used as fill in their backyards .
2007_05_01_1844274	40	In the late 1990s , G.E. performed tests at more than 300 homes and ended up excavating the soil around more than 175 of them , as well as at one Pittsfield public school .
2007_05_01_1844274	41	A resident and former G.E. employee , David Gibbs , 56 , found that several chemical drums had been buried in his backyard near the river .
2007_05_01_1844274	42	In a recent interview , Mr. Gibbs said that he caught G.E. 's contractors trying to cut corners as they cleaned up his property and that he developed a lasting mistrust of the company . ''
2007_05_01_1844274	43	My family 's lived in this neighborhood for over 60 years , '' Mr. Gibbs said . ''
2007_05_01_1844274	44	G.E. owes it to us to clean our river . ''
2007_05_01_1844274	45	Another resident , Tim Gray , 54 , is executive director of the Housatonic River Initiative , which acts as a watchdog on G.E. 's activities .
2007_05_01_1844274	46	Mr. Gray pushed to have Pittsfield added to the national list of Superfund sites , but local officials objected , saying they believed it would stigmatize the city , causing economic harm .
2007_05_01_1844274	47	In March , G.E. held public hearings in Massachusetts and Connecticut to discuss options for cleaning the 135 miles of river from Pittsfield south to the Long Island Sound .
2007_05_01_1844274	48	They range from dredging long stretches to doing nothing at all .
2007_05_01_1844274	49	At a hearing in Kent , Conn. , G.E. presented data indicating that PCB concentrations in fish and invertebrates had declined substantially before leveling off in recent years .
2007_05_01_1844274	50	When the company suggested that the river was cleaning itself , Mr. Gray objected , as did Mr. deFur , the environmental consultant . ''
2007_05_01_1844274	51	I think they 're trying to put something over on people , '' Mr. deFur said .
2007_05_01_1844274	52	If the river was cleaning itself , he said , concentrations would continue to decline .
2007_05_01_1844274	53	He said the chemicals were degraded in water but not destroyed .
2007_05_01_1844274	54	Continued leakage from the plant and an incomplete cleanup mean the riverremains polluted , he said .
2007_05_01_1844274	55	At the Hudson Falls plant , a few ounces of PCBs continue to leak into the river each day , according to G.E. Local environmental advocates express fears that the chemicals have also contaminated the soil beneath homes in the area , but G.E. has not agreed to a residential cleanup , as it did in Pittsfield . ''
2007_05_01_1844274	56	Pittsfield is a precedent that G.E. did not want to set , '' said Robert Goldstein , a lawyer for Riverkeeper , an environmental group on the Hudson . ''
2007_05_01_1844274	57	They did not want to advertise to the folks in Fort Edward that there was an upland cleanup . ''
2007_05_01_1844274	58	Since it would be impossible to reroute the Hudson the way the engineers diverted the Housatonic , Mr. Ramsey , the G.E. official , said the company would use old-fashioned mechanical dredging .
2007_05_01_1844274	59	A '' yellow iron Tonka Toy look-alike clamshell dredge '' will scoop up contaminated river mud and dump it on barges , he said .
2007_05_01_1844274	60	The dried sediment will then be shipped by rail to a licensed landfill outside the Hudson Valley , he said .
2007_05_01_1844274	61	Mr. Ramsey said the Housatonic project had taught him that even with advanced engineering , '' things take longer than everyone thinks . ''
2007_05_01_1844274	62	The biggest challenge on the Hudson will be ensuring that the dredged material is not set adrift , Mr. Ramsey said .
2007_05_01_1844274	63	He said the affected communities needed to understand that if monitoring shows that too much material is escaping , the operation could be slowed down or suspended . ''
2007_05_01_1844274	64	If there are starts and stops , '' Mr. Ramsey said , '' it wo n't be because anyone is trying to pull a fast one . ''
2007_05_01_1844274	65	Correction : May 7 , 2007 , Monday A map on Tuesday with an article comparing two PCB-removal projects by General Electric -- one on the Hudson River in New York and the other on the Housatonic in Massachusetts -- misspelled part of the name of a city near the G.E. factory in Hudson Falls , N.Y. .
2007_05_01_1844274	66	It is Glens Falls , not Glen Falls .
2007_05_01_1844275	0	In response to the deaths of two track workers in accidents , transit officials yesterday suspended more than 20 maintenance projects for subway tracks , signals and tunnels for at least two more days .
2007_05_01_1844275	1	The decision was announced as workers attended the funeral of one transit worker , family members shared memories of another , and transit veterans recounted their own harrowing experiences of the dangers of life underground .
2007_05_01_1844275	2	The safety push will include refresher courses for all employees who work on the tracks . ''
2007_05_01_1844275	3	No one will be on the tracks performing any work whatsoever except for repairs on an emergency basis , '' said Howard H. Roberts Jr. , the president of New York City Transit .
2007_05_01_1844275	4	Mr. Roberts called the work halt on Sunday after the second accident , in which a Queens-bound G train entering the Hoyt-Schermerhorn station in Downtown Brooklyn struck and killed Marvin Franklin , 55 , and injured another worker , Jeff Hill , 41 .
2007_05_01_1844275	5	He said the interruption would last at least another 48 hours , beginning at 5:00 p.m. yesterday .
2007_05_01_1844275	6	The accident came less than a week after Daniel Boggs , a track worker , was killed last Tuesday when he stepped in front of a downtown No. 3 express train at the Columbus Circle station in Manhattan while he was setting out signal lights to warn train operators of work on the tracks ahead .
2007_05_01_1844275	7	Mr. Boggs 's death was the first for a subway worker on the job in more than a year .
2007_05_01_1844275	8	Mr. Roberts said a team of the transit agency 's safety experts and representatives of the Transport Workers Union had worked through the night on Sunday to prepare what he called a curriculum for the safety refresher courses .
2007_05_01_1844275	9	He said the courses would include '' everything you need to know to work safely in that environment . '' ''
2007_05_01_1844275	10	Part of the emphasis , '' he said , '' is , look , you heard it before , maybe it seemed a little dry .
2007_05_01_1844275	11	We now have two tragedies within a week , and understand these rules are there to protect you , and you absolutely have to follow these rules or you 're putting your future and your family 's future in peril . ''
2007_05_01_1844275	12	While the retraining goes on , two separate investigations into the fatal accidents are proceeding .
2007_05_01_1844275	13	Mr. Roberts , who took over the transit agency in April , said he was told the investigations could take up to a month , but added that he hoped to have the results by the end of next week .
2007_05_01_1844275	14	He said he would not recommend any changes in work procedures or safety rules until he saw the reports .
2007_05_01_1844275	15	Mr. Roberts attended the funeral yesterday for Mr. Boggs in Patterson , N.Y. .
2007_05_01_1844275	16	Mr. Boggs was married , had three young children and lived in Brewster , in Putnam County . ''
2007_05_01_1844275	17	I spent the day basically watching a father bury his son , a wife and mother bury her husband and three children bury their father , '' Mr. Roberts said at a news conference later in the day at the transit agency 's headquarters on lower Broadway in Manhattan .
2007_05_01_1844275	18	Several track workers who attended the funeral appeared at a separate news conference at the union headquarters on West End Avenue .
2007_05_01_1844275	19	They spoke about some of the dangers they have faced underground and the need to be constantly on the alert for approaching trains . ''
2007_05_01_1844275	20	You look , you always look , you feel and you hear , '' said Michael Brown , who worked over the weekend on a major construction project on the A and C lines in Brooklyn near the station where Mr. Franklin was killed .
2007_05_01_1844275	21	He said it took several senses to stay alive underground , including staying alert for the vibrations of trains on the rails .
2007_05_01_1844275	22	But he said it was becoming more difficult to notice every train because newer trains are designed to make less noise .
2007_05_01_1844275	23	In addition , some new track components are designed to absorb the shock of the trains and muffle the sound -- innovations that make the subway environment more pleasant for straphangers but potentially more dangerous for workers .
2007_05_01_1844275	24	Jeffrey Lee , a 17-year veteran track worker who switched jobs about a year ago to become a safety representative for the union , recalled at least two close calls .
2007_05_01_1844275	25	About five years ago , he said , he was inspecting work in one of the Steinway tubes , which carry the No. 7 line under the East River .
2007_05_01_1844275	26	Suddenly , a train approached and he looked around for a spot to press up against the wall to get out of the way while the train passed .
2007_05_01_1844275	27	But there was none .
2007_05_01_1844275	28	The train operator saw him and blew his horn and Mr. Lee had to quickly lie down on a narrow ledge along the tube wall as the train lumbered past .
2007_05_01_1844275	29	Another time , he was working on a project in Brooklyn when a work train came barreling down on his crew . ''
2007_05_01_1844275	30	The train had no brakes and everybody started scattering , '' Mr. Lee said .
2007_05_01_1844275	31	He said that after such close calls , '' You sit down and you think about it and you think about your family .
2007_05_01_1844275	32	You think about what could have happened . ''
2007_05_01_1844275	33	Several workers said that track crews and inspectors routinely operated without radios and that the job could be made safer if they had better communications with train operators and controllers .
2007_05_01_1844275	34	Meanwhile , family members and friends recalled Mr. Franklin , the transit worker killed on Sunday .
2007_05_01_1844275	35	He worked for the transit agency for more than 20 years and had a second career as an artist .
2007_05_01_1844275	36	Mr. Franklin 's son , Shah Franklin , 33 , said his father sometimes talked about the dangers of his work . ''
2007_05_01_1844275	37	He told me many stories of other co-workers being killed in the line of duty .
2007_05_01_1844275	38	It was frightening and horrifying to me , '' he said , speaking outside his father 's home in St. Albans , Queens .
2007_05_01_1844275	39	Mr. Franklin was an accomplished artist who loved to draw and paint .
2007_05_01_1844275	40	Dan Gheno , an artist who teaches classes at the Art Students League on West 57th Street , said that Mr. Franklin attended his class regularly and that they became friends .
2007_05_01_1844275	41	He said he was amazed by Mr. Franklin 's dedication . ''
2007_05_01_1844275	42	He would work at night , get off work early in the morning , come to my class , be in class for four hours and then go home and go to sleep and then start it all over again , '' he said . ''
2007_05_01_1844275	43	Artists tend to be private , and he was a great artist but also somebody who reached out to other people , and it shows in his work .
2007_05_01_1844275	44	There 's an incredible humanity in his work that not too many artists are able to convey . ''
2007_05_01_1844275	45	Mr. Franklin 's son said he hoped to be able to put on an exhibit of his father 's drawings of homeless people in the subway .
2007_05_01_1844275	46	At the Hoyt-Schermerhorn station yesterday morning , the only sign of what had happened the day before was some sand that had been spread on the track bed .
2007_05_01_1844275	47	The Queens-bound G train enters the station from a sharp turn , and an official said that might have contributed to the accident , because it gives the workers little time to react .
2007_05_01_1844275	48	The official , who was briefed on the investigation , said the train operator saw Mr. Franklin and Mr. Hill lifting a dolly they had been carrying onto the G platform as the train rounded the turn .
2007_05_01_1844275	49	He was not able to stop in time .
2007_05_01_1844276	0	First , there was a vicious northeaster , a deadly , drenching storm that pinwheeled its way across New Jersey , soaking the state with one of its worst water-related disasters in more than a century .
2007_05_01_1844276	1	Then three New Jerseyans were among the 32 people killed at Virginia Polytechnic Institute in the largest shooting rampage in the nation 's history .
2007_05_01_1844276	2	After that kind of start to his latest incarnation as acting governor of New Jersey , Richard J. Codey 's next matter of business was certain to seem trivial by comparison , and it was .
2007_05_01_1844276	3	He spent some of the first few days of his tenure refereeing in-fighting between his staff members and assistants to Gov. Jon S. Corzine , whose severe injuries in an April 12 car crash thrust Mr. Codey into an extended run as acting governor for the third time in six years .
2007_05_01_1844276	4	Other than that , Mr. Acting Governor , how have things been ? ''
2007_05_01_1844276	5	Of course , it 's been an easy transition , '' a poker-faced Mr. Codey quipped at a ribbon-cutting for a school for autistic children here last Wednesday .
2007_05_01_1844276	6	Mr. Codey , president of the State Senate , is more familiar than most with the peculiarities of filling in as the state 's chief executive , having spent 14 months in the top job after Gov. James E. McGreevey resigned in 2004 , and serving as the perennial understudy during Mr. Corzine 's frequent trips out of town .
2007_05_01_1844276	7	But this latest stint has been particularly challenging because of the back-to-back disasters and the delicate dynamic of trying to assert himself as governor without seeming to step on the still-healing toes of a fellow Democrat , Mr. Corzine . ''
2007_05_01_1844276	8	It 's a tough situation , I do n't deny it , '' Mr. Codey , 59 , said in an interview at his district office here . ''
2007_05_01_1844276	9	It 's not like when I took over for McGreevey ; I had my own staff and I had the freedom to do what I wanted to as governor .
2007_05_01_1844276	10	I 've got an elected governor over me .
2007_05_01_1844276	11	But at the same time it 's not like Jon 's in Israel for a week .
2007_05_01_1844276	12	It 's a hybrid we really have n't had in New Jersey . ''
2007_05_01_1844276	13	He thought a moment and added : '' You 've got to walk a tightrope .
2007_05_01_1844276	14	You 've got to show that the state has a leader , but at the same time , you 've got to be respectful . ''
2007_05_01_1844276	15	After the April 15 northeaster , Mr. Codey took a helicopter tour of New Jersey to survey the damage and spent days imploring Washington to release federal disaster aid for the state .
2007_05_01_1844276	16	Nine counties have been declared federal disaster areas .
2007_05_01_1844276	17	After the shootings at Virginia Tech , Mr. Codey ordered flags lowered to half-staff , declared a statewide day of mourning and attended services for the victims .
2007_05_01_1844276	18	Last week , the second full week of his time in office , was more low-key but no less busy .
2007_05_01_1844276	19	His schedule included attending an awards banquet at Seton Hall University in South Orange last Tuesday ; the opening of a school for autistic children in West Orange last Wednesday ; and the signing of a prevailing wages bill in Trenton on Thursday .
2007_05_01_1844276	20	Then he and Assembly Speaker Joseph J. Roberts Jr. , a Democrat , visited Mr. Corzine at Cooper University Hospital in Camden on Friday .
2007_05_01_1844276	21	Although Mr. Corzine was released from the hospital on Monday , it was unclear when he might be able to resume his duties as governor -- which leaves Mr. Codey in a kind of limbo that he said was not unlike the television reality show '' The Apprentice '' : You never know when you might be fired .
2007_05_01_1844276	22	Unpretentious and prone to self-deprecating humor , Mr. Codey has just as much ego as any other politician , as evidenced by his successful effort to have the word '' acting '' removed from his title during that long post-McGreevey stand-in .
2007_05_01_1844276	23	But he insists that he is a rarity : a happy backup quarterback , ready to play when needed but willing to hand over the job when the starter is ready to go .
2007_05_01_1844276	24	Nor is he troubled by criticism from Mr. Corzine 's camp that he has appeared to enjoy being acting governor a bit too much .
2007_05_01_1844276	25	The critics -- most of them reserve their observations for off-the-record conversations -- have chided Mr. Codey for everything from using a state police helicopter to survey storm damage to conducting a television interview from the governor 's office rather than his more modest one . ''
2007_05_01_1844276	26	Really , to be honest with you , at first , it bothered me , '' he said of the criticism , quick to point out that the television interview was the only time he had even stepped foot in the governor 's State House suite since the accident . ''
2007_05_01_1844276	27	After that , I just said : ` You know , I 'm doing the right thing here .
2007_05_01_1844276	28	I 'm not trying to hurt anybody .
2007_05_01_1844276	29	I 'm not trying to run for anything .
2007_05_01_1844276	30	I 'm not running for governor .
2007_05_01_1844276	31	What 's the problem here ?
2007_05_01_1844276	32	Let 's work together and make the man proud of what we 're doing in his absence . ' ''
2007_05_01_1844276	33	David P. Rebovich , director of the Institute for New Jersey Politics at Rider University , said Mr. Codey has struck a balance between leading and not stepping out of bounds , pointing to the northeaster and the Virginia shootings as examples . ''
2007_05_01_1844276	34	In both cases , Codey stepped to the plate because it was required and New Jerseyans expected their leaders to do something , '' he said .
2007_05_01_1844276	35	Assemblyman John S. Wisniewski , a Democrat from Middlesex County , said , '' It 's an uncomfortable situation , '' but added that Mr. Codey is nevertheless '' ably stewarding the state . ''
2007_05_01_1844276	36	Senator Leonard Lance , Mr. Codey 's Republican counterpart in the Senate leadership , said , '' He has been filling in well for Governor Corzine . ''
2007_05_01_1844276	37	Once they return to their respective elected positions , Mr. Codey and Mr. Corzine will sit across the table from each other during the state 's budget negotiations , which will intensify during the next few weeks .
2007_05_01_1844276	38	They will also discuss the possibility of selling state assets like the New Jersey Turnpike . ''
2007_05_01_1844276	39	How do we interact with Jon on this ? ''
2007_05_01_1844276	40	Mr. Codey wondered in the interview . ''
2007_05_01_1844276	41	I do n't know .
2007_05_01_1844276	42	Do we go to the governor 's mansion , Hoboken ? ''
2007_05_01_1844276	43	which is where Mr. Corzine 's private residence is located .
2007_05_01_1844276	44	He added , '' But wherever we have to go we 're going to go and slug it out with him and his staff . ''
2007_05_01_1844276	45	For now , Mr. Codey is left with two jobs .
2007_05_01_1844276	46	He has been working from his Senate office on the second floor of the State House or his district office here in West Orange , relying mainly on his own staff to coordinate briefings for reporters , and regularly consulting with Tom Shea , Mr. Corzine 's chief of staff , to stay on top of the governor 's responsibilities .
2007_05_01_1844276	47	His schedule is a mix between things Mr. Corzine would have done -- like bill signings and news conferences -- and his routine Senate appearances .
2007_05_01_1844276	48	Last week , he was here for the opening of the Garden Academy , the new school for autistic children , as he had planned to be for weeks . ''
2007_05_01_1844276	49	I bet when you decided to have a ribbon-cutting , you did n't think you 'd get the governor , am I right ? ''
2007_05_01_1844276	50	he asked the audience .
2007_05_01_1844276	51	After the laughter subsided , Mr. Codey added , '' Neither did I. ''
2007_05_01_1844278	0	THEY used to say that life begins at 40 .
2007_05_01_1844278	1	For a familiar advertising character , the lonely Maytag repairman , a new life is beginning at 40 as he gets a major personality makeover .
2007_05_01_1844278	2	The character , who started appearing in national commercials in 1967 , is becoming more active and gregarious , in a change meant to update the concept of '' Ol' Lonely '' for a new generation of shoppers .
2007_05_01_1844278	3	No longer is the repairman a solitary layabout with nothing to do , waiting for calls to fix Maytag appliances that never come .
2007_05_01_1844278	4	Now he takes the initiative to repair other things that Maytag implies ought to be as dependable as its appliances , among them office copiers and cable TV .
2007_05_01_1844278	5	At the same time , the character retains his low-key attitude and aw-shucks manners , which are intended to personify what the new owner of Maytag , Whirlpool , considers to be core values of the Maytag brand .
2007_05_01_1844278	6	The curtain is to be raised today on the new character with a television commercial to appear from early morning , on shows like '' Today , '' through prime time , on shows like '' American Idol . ''
2007_05_01_1844278	7	There will also be ads online , on Web sites like maytag.com and nextmaytagrepairman.com .
2007_05_01_1844278	8	And plans call for personal appearances in unexpected places by Clay Jackson , who recently became the fourth person to portray the repairman nationally since the character 's creation by Leo Burnett in Chicago , part of the Publicis Groupe .
2007_05_01_1844278	9	Previous Maytag repairmen were the actors Jesse White , from 1967-88 ; Gordon Jump , 1989-2003 ; and Hardy Rawls , 2003-7 .
2007_05_01_1844278	10	In undertaking such revampings , marketers confront a tricky balancing act .
2007_05_01_1844278	11	They want to ensure that well-known brand symbols stay current .
2007_05_01_1844278	12	But they prefer not to alter the characters so much that the changes alienate consumers who liked the original versions . ''
2007_05_01_1844278	13	I would n't say it 's without risk , '' Jeffrey Davidoff , vice president for Maytag brand marketing at the Whirlpool Corporation in Benton Harbor , Mich. , said of the changes to the repairman . ''
2007_05_01_1844278	14	We believe we have retained the characteristics that made the character great , '' Mr. Davidoff said , in that '' he still has nothing to do because Maytag 's product quality is so high . '' ''
2007_05_01_1844278	15	But in terms of what is the best way to make him part of today 's world , we decided to get him out in today 's world instead of just sitting in his office , '' he added , where the character had so frequently been seen over the last four decades .
2007_05_01_1844278	16	At one point , it seemed that it would not matter whether or not ad characters appealed to contemporary consumers because the characters were perceived as old-fashioned -- relics of the era of mass marketing through mass media .
2007_05_01_1844278	17	Recently , though , characters have been making something of a comeback , as illustrated by a lengthening list of advertisers who are bringing out new characters or freshening vintage ones . ''
2007_05_01_1844278	18	There seems to be a bit of a resurgence of character-based advertising , '' said Michael Keller , chief brand officer at International Dairy Queen in Minneapolis , part of Berkshire Hathaway .
2007_05_01_1844278	19	Mr. Keller cited examples like a talking family of Whopper sandwiches , sponsored by Burger King , and a line of anthropomorphic mustards from the French 's division of Reckitt Benckiser .
2007_05_01_1844278	20	Dairy Queen is getting into the act , too , introducing two characters to be the stars of a $ 25 million campaign beginning this week for new products like the Waffle Bowl Sundae .
2007_05_01_1844278	21	The characters , created by Grey Worldwide in New York , part of the WPP Group , are '' definitely a bit tongue in cheek , '' Mr. Keller said , to signal younger consumers that Dairy Queen has a sense of humor about dairy products behaving like people .
2007_05_01_1844278	22	The Maytag makeover is also meant to make the campaign more humorous , not by turning the repairman into a clown but by placing him in funny situations . ''
2007_05_01_1844278	23	The new repairman is no longer fatalistic , '' Mr. Davidoff said , '' but optimistic . ''
2007_05_01_1844278	24	For instance , in the new commercial , two office workers find the repairman visiting their workplace .
2007_05_01_1844278	25	The male worker is convinced he caused the visit by leaving leftovers too long in the office refrigerator .
2007_05_01_1844278	26	His female co-worker clues him in : The repairman is actually there to fix the copier , which is of course a product Maytag does not make . ''
2007_05_01_1844278	27	So you 're trying to keep busy , huh ? ''
2007_05_01_1844278	28	she asks the repairman .
2007_05_01_1844278	29	He helpfully lets her know the copier is running low on toner .
2007_05_01_1844278	30	The character '' has clearly got a lot of time on his hands ; that has been the setup for decades , '' said Ed Han , senior vice president and creative director at the present Maytag agency , Publicis USA in New York , part of the Publicis Worldwide unit of Publicis . ''
2007_05_01_1844278	31	Now , he has a younger approach to life , '' Mr. Han said . ''
2007_05_01_1844278	32	He wants to be out there more , and since he 's mechanically inclined -- he is a repairman -- this plays off the character 's story . ''
2007_05_01_1844278	33	Publicis New York , which creates campaigns for appliances bearing the Whirlpool brand , inherited the Maytag assignment last May from its sibling , Burnett , after Whirlpool acquired Maytag . ''
2007_05_01_1844278	34	There were definitely discussions about ` do we or do n't we ' '' keep the character , Mr. Han said , but '' after research with consumers , we found there was so much equity left in him that it would be foolish to do away with the character . ''
2007_05_01_1844278	35	Still , the consumers were telling the agency '' the repairman had become old-fashioned , '' Mr. Han said .
2007_05_01_1844278	36	That was hindering efforts to sell Maytag appliances on the basis of modernity , he added , to counter inroads by newer brands like LG and Samsung .
2007_05_01_1844278	37	Another benefit of the new personality for the Maytag repairman is that it lets the character be shown as competent in what he does .
2007_05_01_1844278	38	By contrast , all those years he sat around waiting to fix Maytags that did not break down , he showed his proficiency only at tasks like playing solitaire .
2007_05_01_1844278	39	Mr. Davidoff said the personality change would enhance the character 's ability to sell Maytags on the basis of features and benefits because '' the idea he has familiarity and expertise with the products makes sense . ''
2007_05_01_1844278	40	And by having the repairman spend his time repairing other things , Mr. Davidoff said , it avoids '' making him a huckster . ''
2007_05_01_1844278	41	That type of persona for a brand character , which plays down the peddling , also appealed to Georgia-Pacific , which is introducing a stylish , make-believe wife and mother named Phoebe Fontaine as the personification of its Vanity Fair brand of paper napkins .
2007_05_01_1844278	42	Ads by the Seiden Group in New York present Phoebe not as an old-school '' brand icon , '' said Kimberlee Burrows , director for marketing communications at Georgia-Pacific in Atlanta , but more as a modern '' brand ambassador . '' ''
2007_05_01_1844278	43	It bridges the gap between our parents ' generation and ours , '' Ms. Burrows said .
2007_05_01_1844278	44	Phoebe , being new , is a blank slate , whom Georgia-Pacific and Seiden can make as modern as they please .
2007_05_01_1844278	45	The Maytag repairman , on the other hand , dates to the year '' In the Heat of the Night '' was in movie theaters , the first microwave oven was sold for home use and the Beatles released '' Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band . ''
2007_05_01_1844278	46	Whirlpool and Publicis New York are not minimizing the challenges inherent in making over so venerable a character . ''
2007_05_01_1844278	47	It 's like moving a china cabinet full of china , '' Mr. Davidoff said . ''
2007_05_01_1844278	48	You can move it , '' he added , laughing . ''
2007_05_01_1844278	49	Just not too fast . ''
2007_05_01_1844279	0	In the spring of 1998 , the chief financial officer of New Century Financial , a lender to home buyers with blemished credit , wrote an unusual paper describing a then little-known accounting technique .
2007_05_01_1844279	1	The executive , Edward F. Gotschall , marketed his white paper at industry seminars and conferences , and promoted it to Wall Street analysts as an insider 's look at New Century , according to people who read the paper .
2007_05_01_1844279	2	New Century was at the time one of the nation 's fastest-growing subprime lenders .
2007_05_01_1844279	3	Now that technique , called gain on sale , may be coming back to haunt the company , which filed for bankruptcy protection on April 2 after disclosing a month earlier that federal prosecutors and securities regulators were investigating accounting mistakes and stock sales at the company .
2007_05_01_1844279	4	The company is expected to file restated results for most of 2006 as early as this month .
2007_05_01_1844279	5	The technique promoted by Mr. Gotschall , who stepped down as chief financial officer in 2006 but continued as vice chairman of the board of directors , allowed the company to report profits before they actually existed .
2007_05_01_1844279	6	The paper profits were pegged to future earnings from loan sales to institutional investors .
2007_05_01_1844279	7	The results , which were nearly always prettier than those produced through traditional , conservative accounting in which profits were recorded only when cash comes through door , were then used to make more loans to risky home buyers .
2007_05_01_1844279	8	Used properly , gain on sale is legal .
2007_05_01_1844279	9	Big investment banks routinely employ the technique when packaging securities for sale to institutional investors .
2007_05_01_1844279	10	Unlike specialty finance lenders like New Century , though , Wall Street banks have deep pockets to support themselves if expected earnings from gain on sale accounting fail to materialize .
2007_05_01_1844279	11	But some financial analysts say that New Century appears to have also used gain on sale to hide losses as the subprime market began to falter late last year .
2007_05_01_1844279	12	A New Century spokeswoman declined to comment on the company 's use of gain on sale accounting , citing the bankruptcy proceedings .
2007_05_01_1844279	13	The use of gain on sale was a factor in the collapse of Enron in 2001 and of major specialty lenders in the late 1990s through this decade .
2007_05_01_1844279	14	Conseco , a large insurance and finance company that made loans to subprime home buyers , filed for bankruptcy protection in 2002 , one of the largest corporate bankruptcies ever .
2007_05_01_1844279	15	Critics say that the accounting technique remains ripe for abuse , even though federal accounting regulators tightened up the rules in the wake of Enron . ''
2007_05_01_1844279	16	The thing about gain on sale accounting is that you can create a machine that just manufactures earnings out of thin air , '' said Richard Benson , an expert on securitization and president of the Specialty Finance Group , a financial broker .
2007_05_01_1844279	17	The deterioration in recent months of the estimated $ 1.3 trillion subprime housing market has been tied to rising loan delinquencies and the decision by Wall Street to cut off billion-dollar credit lines to companies like New Century , which last year was the largest independent player in the industry .
2007_05_01_1844279	18	But Mr. Benson said that the stock prices of subprime home lenders like New Century Financial had '' collapsed so fast because the income and balance sheet had been built on gain on sale , which turns out to be imaginary . '' ''
2007_05_01_1844279	19	The market woke up to the fact that there 's no there there , '' Mr. Benson said .
2007_05_01_1844279	20	Other bankrupt or struggling subprime lenders that have used gain on sale accounting , or still do , include NovaStar Financial , Fieldstone Investment , Fremont General and Accredited Home Lenders , according to securities filings .
2007_05_01_1844279	21	New Century , of Irvine , Calif. , made money in two ways , and it used gain on sale for both .
2007_05_01_1844279	22	In the first way , called '' whole loan sales , '' it sold pools of loans to big Wall Street investment banks .
2007_05_01_1844279	23	New Century made money by keeping the difference between the higher interest rates paid by subprime borrowers and the lower rates offered to the banks .
2007_05_01_1844279	24	In the second way , New Century chopped up its other loans to home buyers , repackaged them into securities for sale to investors , a process called securitization .
2007_05_01_1844279	25	New Century then kept the pieces expected to earn money in the future , called residuals , for itself .
2007_05_01_1844279	26	For both types of business , gain on sale allowed New Century to accelerate its profits .
2007_05_01_1844279	27	In 2005 , the last year for which it has reported annual figures , New Century recorded income from gain on sale accounting of nearly $ 623 million out of a gross profit that year of $ 1.4 billion , according to its securities filings .
2007_05_01_1844279	28	For the whole loan sales , New Century recorded up front the cash gains .
2007_05_01_1844279	29	At the same time , New Century guaranteed to Wall Street investors that if the whole loans did not make as much money as it predicted -- if home buyers were late with or defaulted on payments -- New Century would buy back the impaired loans from the banks .
2007_05_01_1844279	30	But through overly rosy forecasts , New Century underestimated how many impaired loans it would have to repurchase and how much it would need to have on hand to do that .
2007_05_01_1844279	31	In its second use of gain on sale , New Century booked future earnings based on its estimates of what it expected to earn from the pieces left over from the securitizations .
2007_05_01_1844279	32	New Century 's problem , according to Zach Gast , an analyst with the Center for Financial Research and Analysis , was how it used gain on sale for its whole loan business .
2007_05_01_1844279	33	In the late 1990s , in the last downturn for subprime lenders , most abuses of gain on sale involved the securitization side .
2007_05_01_1844279	34	At New Century Financial , '' it was aggressive accounting , that is certain , '' Mr. Gast said . ''
2007_05_01_1844279	35	But there are hints that New Century knew exactly how aggressive it was . ''
2007_05_01_1844279	36	As the subprime market started to melt down last fall , New Century was forced to honor its guarantees to investment banks and other institutional investors and repurchase the impaired loans .
2007_05_01_1844279	37	It resold the loans at a loss .
2007_05_01_1844279	38	But , Mr. Gast said , when New Century repurchased the loans , it recorded them at values that exceeded the fire-sale prices .
2007_05_01_1844279	39	In other words , New Century did not recognize upfront the losses in the impaired loans .
2007_05_01_1844279	40	Mr. Gast said that New Century has '' a huge number of repurchased loans that they have n't taken losses on . ''
2007_05_01_1844279	41	Under gain on sale accounting rules , '' you should be recognizing the loss at the initial sale of the loan , '' Mr. Gast said , adding that if you underestimate potential losses , you have to recognize those losses when you are forced to repurchase the loans -- something New Century did not do .
2007_05_01_1844279	42	He called New Century 's accounting '' creative . ''
2007_05_01_1844279	43	The evidence for this , according to Mr. Gast , is in New Century 's filing in February for the third quarter of last year .
2007_05_01_1844279	44	There , the lender disclosed for the first time that it had sold $ 242 million in loans for the period , but also repurchased $ 468 million in bad loans .
2007_05_01_1844279	45	New Century probably has at least $ 100 million in unreported pretax losses for the third quarter of last year , according to Mr. Gast 's analysis . ''
2007_05_01_1844279	46	They still have n't reported this loss , which is why they 're restating , '' he said .
2007_05_01_1844279	47	In its third-quarter 2006 filing , the company said that it would restate its earnings for the first nine months of 2006 and record a loss for the final quarter because it had understated the havoc wreaked by bad loans .
2007_05_01_1844279	48	Investors sent New Century 's stock price plummeting .
2007_05_01_1844279	49	Mr. Gast said it was unclear what any potential losses for previous periods might be because New Century had not provided details in securities filings on loan repurchases for earlier periods .
2007_05_01_1844279	50	In his white paper , Mr. Gotschall , a co-founder of New Century , urged lenders to disclose more information about the assumptions and forecasts they used to predict future earnings .
2007_05_01_1844279	51	But New Century appears not to have followed that philosophy .
2007_05_01_1844279	52	Stephen Ryan , an accounting professor at New York University and an expert on securitization accounting , said that last year New Century had '' underestimated the allowance for repurchase losses , which means that they overstated the gain on sale . '' ''
2007_05_01_1844279	53	They had had a history of doing so well previously , so it 's a question of whether they did n't expect this or of something more nefarious on the part of senior management , '' Professor Ryan said .
2007_05_01_1844279	54	Correction : May 10 , 2007 , Thursday Because of an editing error , an article in Business Day on May 1 about an accounting technique used by New Century Financial misstated the year that the company 's chief financial officer , Edward F. Gotschall , stepped down from that job .
2007_05_01_1844279	55	It was 2004 , not 2006 .
2007_05_01_1844279	56	( Mr. Gotschall is still with the company as a vice chairman . )
2007_05_01_1844280	0	Like deep-dish pizza , the Cubs and a mayor named Daley , LaSalle Bank has long been a Chicago institution .
2007_05_01_1844280	1	But until a few weeks ago , few would have called it a global banking prize .
2007_05_01_1844280	2	LaSalle is at the center of what could be the biggest bank deal ever , as a trophy for at least two banking titans : Bank of America and the Royal Bank of Scotland .
2007_05_01_1844280	3	LaSalle is attractive to both banks for similar reasons .
2007_05_01_1844280	4	Its longstanding ties to small and midsize business customers in Chicago and Midwest have given it a strong cash management and commercial lending franchise .
2007_05_01_1844280	5	And with few opportunities to gain a large foothold in the Chicago market , buying LaSalle -- whose 135 area branches make it one of the area 's top players -- may be the most efficient way to gain size . ''
2007_05_01_1844280	6	If you have national or global ambitions , this is the third most important city in the country , '' said Paul M. McCarthy , chairman and chief executive of Marquette Bank , a community bank with 26 offices in the Chicago area . ''
2007_05_01_1844280	7	There are only a few ways to get here , and this is the only apparent one . ''
2007_05_01_1844280	8	LaSalle was put in play after its Dutch parent , ABN Amro , agreed to sell itself to Barclays of Britain for $ 88 billion but carved out and sold the Chicago franchise to Bank of America in an effort to thwart rival bids .
2007_05_01_1844280	9	Last week , a group of buyers led by the Royal Bank of Scotland submitted a $ 98 billion offer for ABN and over the weekend signaled its desire to snap up LaSalle Bank .
2007_05_01_1844280	10	Bank of America insists that it has a firm contract in place to buy LaSalle for $ 21 billion and is forging ahead with its takeover plans .
2007_05_01_1844280	11	But ABN shareholders have been calling for a separate vote that could derail the deal .
2007_05_01_1844280	12	A Dutch court is expected to weigh in later this week .
2007_05_01_1844280	13	But the Royal Bank of Scotland group is considering submitting a higher bid for LaSalle , making their offer conditional on securing ABN Amro , said a person close to the banking consortium .
2007_05_01_1844280	14	For Bank of America , an acquisition would fill an important gap in its nationwide branch network .
2007_05_01_1844280	15	With more than 191 Chicago area branches flying under the Bank of America flag , the deal would transform it from a tiny player to one of the area 's largest banks .
2007_05_01_1844280	16	The possible deal also comes as Bank of America 's revenue growth has been slowing and expenses are on the rise .
2007_05_01_1844280	17	With its deposits nearing the federal cap , it chief executive , Kenneth D. Lewis , has said that he would like to focus more on internal growth .
2007_05_01_1844280	18	Still , Bank of America , long an acquisition machine , may need another big deal to regain its step , several Wall Street analysts said .
2007_05_01_1844280	19	Even if it pays a healthy premium , the bank could find opportunities to improve the management of its branches and easily flush out costs .
2007_05_01_1844280	20	For the Royal Bank of Scotland , which already has a 4.8 percent market share in the Chicago area through its Charter One franchise , the deal would give it a much bigger presence to expand . ''
2007_05_01_1844280	21	They face the same challenges that all foreign banks have faced in the United States , '' said Bert Ely , a banking analyst . ''
2007_05_01_1844280	22	They have made a lot of acquisitions and grown well , but long-term , they want to bulk up . ''
2007_05_01_1844280	23	Other banks may have similar plans .
2007_05_01_1844280	24	Charles O. Prince III , Citigroup 's chief executive , said earlier this month that the company had been looking for opportunities to expand in the Midwest , though many feel the company , which has begun an overhaul , has too much on its plate to handle a deal of this size .
2007_05_01_1844280	25	And banking analysts have tossed up names of other possible LaSalle buyers : National City , KeyCorp and JPMorgan Chase are at the top of the list . ''
2007_05_01_1844280	26	It 's a jump ball , '' said David Hendler , a banking analyst at CreditSights , an independent research firm in New York . ''
2007_05_01_1844280	27	There are just not a lot of clean , single-purpose banks to do it with . ''
2007_05_01_1844280	28	Not all analysts find LaSalle -- whose $ 122 billion in assets makes it the 17th largest bank in the United States -- such a prize . ''
2007_05_01_1844280	29	The guy who wins it will probably wind up losing , '' said Richard X. Bove , a banking analyst with Punk Ziegel & Company . ''
2007_05_01_1844280	30	It 's hard for me to understand why everybody wants it .
2007_05_01_1844280	31	Almost half the bank is in Michigan and there is a big chunk in Detroit .
2007_05_01_1844280	32	And what they are doing in Chicago on the retail side is not all that impressive . ''
2007_05_01_1844280	33	Still , most Chicagoans have considered LaSalle their hometown bank since it was founded in 1927 .
2007_05_01_1844280	34	Located on LaSalle Street in the heart of the city 's financial district , it has been a pillar of Chicago commerce and of the community .
2007_05_01_1844280	35	The bank is a sponsor of the Chicago Marathon and is a big supporter of the arts .
2007_05_01_1844280	36	More important , LaSalle is one of the few Chicagoland branch networks left .
2007_05_01_1844280	37	Until the early 1980s , Illinois state banking laws put severe restrictions on establishing branch offices .
2007_05_01_1844280	38	That left Chicago with hundreds of small independent banks with a handful of offices but few with a branch footprint that extended across the region .
2007_05_01_1844280	39	Even today , with the exception of JPMorgan Chase and Bank of Montreal 's Harris Bank , no other retail bank besides LaSalle has more than a 4 percent share , according to Mercer Oliver Wyman Research .
2007_05_01_1844280	40	And most have less than a 1 percent share .
2007_05_01_1844280	41	By contrast , in New York City , at least seven big banks have control more than 4 percent of the retail banking market .
2007_05_01_1844280	42	Because the Chicago market is so fragmented and competitive , it is extremely difficult for new entrants to gain share . ''
2007_05_01_1844280	43	What it comes down to is that a lot of players have tried organic growth strategies , '' said Michael Polous , the head of Mercer 's Oliver Wyman 's retail bank consulting practice . ''
2007_05_01_1844280	44	Almost all of them have broken their sword . ''
2007_05_01_1844282	0	The Supreme Court , in its most important patent ruling in years , on Monday raised the bar for obtaining patents on new products that combine elements of pre-existing inventions .
2007_05_01_1844282	1	If the combination results from nothing more than '' ordinary innovation '' and '' does no more than yield predictable results , '' the court said in a unanimous opinion , it is not entitled to the exclusive rights that patent protection conveys . ''
2007_05_01_1844282	2	Were it otherwise , '' Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote in the opinion , '' patents might stifle , rather than promote , the progress of useful arts . ''
2007_05_01_1844282	3	Because most inventions combine previously known elements , the court 's approach to deciding what sort of combination is so '' obvious '' as to be ineligible for patent protection will have widespread application .
2007_05_01_1844282	4	The result will be to make patents harder to obtain and defend . ''
2007_05_01_1844282	5	Granting patent protection to advances that would occur in the ordinary course without real innovation retards progress , '' Justice Kennedy said .
2007_05_01_1844282	6	He added that such patents were also undesirable because they might deprive earlier innovations of '' their value or utility . ''
2007_05_01_1844282	7	Patent law experts said the ruling created a common sense standard that could have a broad impact . ''
2007_05_01_1844282	8	Nearly every patent that contains a combination of prior ideas is at risk because the court has dramatically broadened the standard of obviousness , '' said Cynthia Kernick , an intellectual property lawyer at Reed Smith in Pittsburgh .
2007_05_01_1844282	9	Judges will have more leeway to dismiss patent infringement lawsuits without requiring a jury trial , and patent examiners , who generally grant patent applications unless they find prior references to the same invention , will now feel freer to deny claims , said Matthew Kreeger , an intellectual property lawyer at Morrison and Foerster in San Francisco . ''
2007_05_01_1844282	10	And we could see thousands of cases asking the Patent Office to re-examine patents it has already granted , '' said Mr. Kreeger , who was one of the lawyers who had prepared a brief filed by the Biotechnology Industry Organization in support of the patent . ''
2007_05_01_1844282	11	It does n't take a lot of resources to ask for a re-examination . ''
2007_05_01_1844282	12	To be eligible for a patent , an invention must be novel , useful and not '' obvious '' to a person of '' ordinary skill '' in the field .
2007_05_01_1844282	13	The Supreme Court case concerned a fairly typical dispute over whether a combination of old elements in a new way was new or simply '' obvious '' to any expert .
2007_05_01_1844282	14	At issue was an adjustable gas pedal for use on cars and trucks equipped with electronic engine controls .
2007_05_01_1844282	15	How could the vehicle 's computer tell the pedal 's position ?
2007_05_01_1844282	16	A Canadian company , KSR International , under contract to General Motors , solved the problem by mounting an electronic sensor at the pedal 's fixed pivot point in order to communicate the necessary information .
2007_05_01_1844282	17	A rival , Teleflex Inc. , demanded royalties , claiming the device infringed its patent on an adjustable gas pedal equipped with an electronic sensor .
2007_05_01_1844282	18	KSR refused to pay on the ground that Teleflex had combined existing elements in an obvious manner and that its patent was therefore invalid .
2007_05_01_1844282	19	KSR won in Federal District Court in Detroit , but that decision was overturned in 2005 by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit .
2007_05_01_1844282	20	That court , in Washington , has exclusive jurisdiction over patent appeals .
2007_05_01_1844282	21	After years of permitting its judgments to stand unreviewed , the Supreme Court has begun to take an active interest in the Federal Circuit 's cases and has overturned several , including a second case the justices decided on Monday in favor of Microsoft in a dispute with AT&T .
2007_05_01_1844282	22	In granting judgment for KSR on Monday , in KSR International Co. v. Teleflex Inc. , No. 04-1350 , the Supreme Court listed several specific errors and '' fundamental misunderstandings '' in how the Federal Circuit had analyzed the case .
2007_05_01_1844282	23	In looking at the Teleflex patent , Justice Kennedy said , the appeals court made the mistake of considering what '' a pedal designer writing on a blank slate '' would have done to solve the problem of the pedal and the sensor .
2007_05_01_1844282	24	But the slate was not blank , he continued , and the Teleflex patent was essentially an upgrade of existing technology .
2007_05_01_1844282	25	Justice Kennedy said the problem was not necessarily the Federal Circuit 's overall approach , but rather its rigid way of applying a commonly used legal test .
2007_05_01_1844282	26	The test requires a person challenging a patent as obvious to identify a reason that would have prompted someone to combine two or more previous inventions , such as published articles suggesting such a combination .
2007_05_01_1844282	27	This has made it difficult to attack a patent as obvious , and has often precluded summary judgment , instead requiring an expensive jury trial .
2007_05_01_1844282	28	Justice Kennedy said that this test , in the Federal Circuit 's hands , had led to a '' constricted analysis '' that paid too much attention to an inventor 's motivation and too little to a simpler inquiry : whether '' there existed at the time of invention a known problem for which there was an obvious solution . ''
2007_05_01_1844282	29	The Teleflex patent fit that description , he said .
2007_05_01_1844282	30	The federal government , which had sided with KSR , argued that the Federal Circuit 's approach had led to the granting of too many patents to obvious inventions .
2007_05_01_1844282	31	Pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry groups , entering the case for Teleflex , argued that innovation would suffer if patents became too hard to defend .
2007_05_01_1844282	32	In a sense , the case presented a moving target .
2007_05_01_1844282	33	While the KSR appeal was pending , the Federal Circuit issued several decisions reflecting openness to challenges to patents as unworthy because of obviousness . ''
2007_05_01_1844282	34	Those decisions , of course , are not before us now , '' Justice Kennedy said .
2007_05_01_1844282	35	Court Sides With Microsoft WASHINGTON , April 30 ( AP ) -- The Supreme Court sided with the Microsoft Corporation on Monday , finding that patent law does not apply to software sent to foreign countries .
2007_05_01_1844282	36	In a 7-1 decision , the court rejected AT&T 's position that it was entitled to damages for every Windows-based computer made outside the United States using technology that compresses speech into computer code .
2007_05_01_1844282	37	AT&T had said computers running the Windows operating system infringed on its technology for a digital speech coder system .
2007_05_01_1844282	38	The decision could affect other lawsuits against Microsoft and save it billions because of the global scope of its operations .
2007_05_01_1844282	39	The Supreme Court said software should be treated like exported blueprints and schematics .
2007_05_01_1844283	0	Early in the 20th century , the safeguarding of food at American ports often amounted to inspectors from the Food and Drug Administration prying open containers of molasses or sugar and examining them for mold or insect parts .
2007_05_01_1844283	1	The F.D.A. has come a way since then .
2007_05_01_1844283	2	But not much more .
2007_05_01_1844283	3	Last year , inspectors sampled just 20,662 shipments out of more than 8.9 million that arrived at American ports .
2007_05_01_1844283	4	China , which in one decade has become the third-largest exporter of food , by value , to the United States , sent 199,000 shipments , of which less than 2 percent were sampled , former officials with the agency said .
2007_05_01_1844283	5	Now , as F.D.A. inspectors travel to China to investigate the source of contaminated pet food that has killed at least 16 dogs and cats and sickened thousands of others , critics in Washington are warning that the agency is woefully understaffed and underfinanced to keep America 's food supply safe . ''
2007_05_01_1844283	6	The public thinks the food supply is much more protected than it is , '' said William Hubbard , a former associate commissioner who left in 2005 after 27 years at the agency . ''
2007_05_01_1844283	7	If people really knew how weak the F.D.A. program is , they would be shocked . ''
2007_05_01_1844283	8	Globalization and new manufacturing capabilities have changed the makeup of the food that Americans put on their table .
2007_05_01_1844283	9	Food processors in the United States are buying a greater number of ingredients from other countries , becoming more of an assembler in the nation 's food supply chain . ''
2007_05_01_1844283	10	With globalization , American food processors are turning to less-developed countries to get food ingredients because they can get them so much more cheaply , '' Mr. Hubbard said .
2007_05_01_1844283	11	To be sure , the F.D.A. has a number of procedures aimed at identifying problems with imported foods .
2007_05_01_1844283	12	Last year , the agency visually inspected over 115,000 shipments in addition to sending samples of over 20,000 shipments to a laboratory for analysis .
2007_05_01_1844283	13	Still , the number of food inspections has lagged even as the number of food imports has shot up in recent years .
2007_05_01_1844283	14	Shipments more than doubled to an estimated 9.1 million this year from 2000 , and are more than four times what they were in 1996 .
2007_05_01_1844283	15	They have also doubled in value to $ 79.9 billion since 1996 , according to the United States International Trade Commission .
2007_05_01_1844283	16	Congress is scheduled to tackle the agency 's financing issues and food-safety concerns as part of a broader hearing today of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform .
2007_05_01_1844283	17	The F.D.A. employs only about 1,750 food inspectors at ports and domestic food-production plants .
2007_05_01_1844283	18	There are so few inspectors that most domestic plants get a visit from an F.D.A. inspector only once every five to 10 years , Mr. Hubbard said .
2007_05_01_1844283	19	Unlike meat-processing plants overseen by the Agriculture Department , foreign food-production plants are not regularly monitored by the F.D.A. Tommy G. Thompson , the former secretary of health and human services , expressed deep concern about the nation 's food supply when he resigned , for unrelated reasons , in December 2004 . ''
2007_05_01_1844283	20	For the life of me I can not understand why the terrorists have not attacked our food supply because it is so easy to do , '' said Mr. Thompson , who is a member of the Coalition for a Stronger F.D.A. , a lobby group in Washington , and is running for president .
2007_05_01_1844283	21	He said he worried '' every single night '' about threats to the food supply .
2007_05_01_1844283	22	Mr. Thompson 's concern stems from a growing gap between a flood of imports and a weakened food inspection regime .
2007_05_01_1844283	23	The F.D.A. , which is responsible for monitoring 80 percent of the country 's food , inspects barely 1 percent of the food shipments arriving annually at hundreds of ports throughout the country , according to government statistics .
2007_05_01_1844283	24	After Sept. 11 , 2001 , Mr. Thompson persuaded Congress to add 600 more inspectors , increasing the total F.D.A. field staff for food , drugs and medical devices , to about 4,000 .
2007_05_01_1844283	25	But since then , the agency 's budget has not kept pace with inflation and the staff has decreased to 3,488 -- fewer than the 3,500 in 2002 .
2007_05_01_1844283	26	Three spokesmen at the F.D.A. did not respond to phone calls and e-mail seeking responses to questions about the agency 's staffing and inspections .
2007_05_01_1844283	27	The latest episode of food contamination has alarmed many lawmakers in Washington .
2007_05_01_1844283	28	Senator Richard J. Durbin , a Democrat from Illinois , sent a letter last Thursday to the Agriculture Appropriations Committee warning that '' F.D.A. 's resources have not kept pace with its responsibilities , and increasing quantities of imported food products will continue to stress F.D.A. 's capabilities . ''
2007_05_01_1844283	29	Mr. Durbin requested $ 650 million in next year 's Agricultural appropriations bill for the food safety inspection program .
2007_05_01_1844283	30	Mr. Durbin noted that while the F.D.A 's budget increased over the past two decades by three-and-a-half times , to $ 1.5 billion from $ 416.7 million , the budget for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention increased by more than 12 times and the National Institutes of Health rose about five times .
2007_05_01_1844283	31	More than 130 countries ship food items to the United States .
2007_05_01_1844283	32	Canada , Mexico and China have led the way , with China shipping nearly five times as much in food items to the United States as it did in 1996 , international trade commission figures show .
2007_05_01_1844283	33	Beverages , fish , nuts and fresh fruits and vegetables are among the categories showing the biggest growth .
2007_05_01_1844283	34	There have also been increases in categories like residues and waste from food industries ; prepared animal feed ; and '' gums , resins and other vegetable saps and extracts , '' the trade commission said . ''
2007_05_01_1844283	35	Emulsifiers '' or '' stabilizers '' found in chewing gums and candies , for example , come from sub-Saharan Africa and Pakistan , Mr. Hubbard , the former F.D.A. official , said .
2007_05_01_1844283	36	Imports of milling industry products like wheat gluten , while still small , have more than doubled in value since 1996 .
2007_05_01_1844283	37	Food processors use glutens to raise protein content and thicken everything from candy bars to pet food . ''
2007_05_01_1844283	38	In the same meal these days we may be eating food from several regions of the world , '' said Caroline Smith DeWaal , the director of food safety for the Center for Science in the Public Interest , a Washington lobbying group . ''
2007_05_01_1844283	39	These food processors may be looking for a cheap new source , but they may pay for it down the line . ''
2007_05_01_1844283	40	Companies like Menu Foods that have discovered melamine , the product suspected of causing the pet deaths , have been forced to recall several kinds of pet foods .
2007_05_01_1844283	41	In contrast to the F.D.A. , the Agriculture Department , which oversees meat and poultry and monitors about 20 percent of the food supply , has about 9,000 food inspectors , more than five times that of the F.D.A. With more clout , it can require a foreign country to duplicate American slaughterhouse practices and send inspectors to certify foreign plants .
2007_05_01_1844283	42	Today the risks can be chemical , pesticide-related or bacterial in nature -- none of which can be found by simply looking at the food , Mr. Hubbard said .
2007_05_01_1844283	43	Large food sellers like Wal-Mart and grocery store chains have forced importers to sign contracts guaranteeing that their food is not contaminated .
2007_05_01_1844283	44	Large food processors like Cargill have put in place quality assurance programs in foreign-operated plants . ''
2007_05_01_1844283	45	The large companies have already developed quality assurance systems that go across national boundaries , '' Ms. Smith DeWaal said . ''
2007_05_01_1844283	46	But we need those kinds of systems that are designed for medium and small companies that want to trade , and ensure that they are being enforced and audited in the countries where they are originating . ''
2007_05_01_1844283	47	Otherwise , with the food-safety inspection system clearly overwhelmed , other countries will increasingly look at the United States as a dumping ground for substandard food shipments , Mr. Hubbard said . ''
2007_05_01_1844283	48	The word is out , '' he said . ''
2007_05_01_1844283	49	If you send a problem shipment to the United States it is going to get in and you wo n't get caught , and you wo n't have your food returned to you , let alone get arrested or imprisoned . ''
2007_05_01_1844283	50	Correction : May 3 , 2007 , Thursday An article in Business Day on Tuesday about the inspection of imported foods by the Food and Drug Administration referred imprecisely to the Senate panel on agriculture appropriations that received a letter from Senator Richard J. Durbin , Democrat of Illinois , warning that the F.D.A. 's resources were overtaxed .

2007_05_01_1844286	0	The dream of Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum to win the Kentucky Derby died this year in the same place it took flight : his desert kingdom , Dubai .
2007_05_01_1844286	1	His last 3-year-old prospect , a colt named Day Pass , struggled to finish ninth in the U.A.E. Derby .
2007_05_01_1844286	2	The sheik did not appear disappointed that his run for the roses ended at Nad Al Sheba racetrack on March 31 rather than at Churchill Downs on Saturday .
2007_05_01_1844286	3	He shuttled between the multilevel royal boxes , which he shared with dozens of the male members of his family , to the paddock where some of the best thoroughbreds in the world were saddled over seven races in the hope of taking home $ 21.25 million of the sheik 's purse money .
2007_05_01_1844286	4	Sheik Mohammed switched from a gold dishdasha to a black one , gave out one trophy after another , and indicated that the Dubai World Cup , the world 's richest race , was going to get richer because he intended to plump its $ 6 million purse to $ 10 million .
2007_05_01_1844286	5	Like no other horseman in the world , the sheik has learned that it is easier to build the world 's tallest building or create artificial islands -- endeavors are under way in Dubai -- than it is to win a Kentucky Derby .
2007_05_01_1844286	6	In 1999 , he sent Worldly Manner to the Derby , proclaiming that if the colt did not win the race , one of his horses would do so within four years .
2007_05_01_1844286	7	From 1999 to 2002 , however , his stable went 0 for 5 in the Derby , with a top finish of sixth , by China Visit in 2000 .
2007_05_01_1844286	8	He has not been back since . ''
2007_05_01_1844286	9	We 'll go to the Derby when we 've got the horses , '' said Simon Crisford , the manager of the Maktoum family 's Godolphin Stable , which is based in Dubai and has sent horses to victories in many of the most prestigious races around the globe .
2007_05_01_1844286	10	There is little doubt that the sheik is spending a great deal of money to return to Churchill Downs .
2007_05_01_1844286	11	He has been the leading buyer at Keeneland 's September yearling sales over the past eight years , spending $ 245.6 million .
2007_05_01_1844286	12	The sheik has also built a commercial breeding and racing business on more than 4,000 acres in the bluegrass of Kentucky .
2007_05_01_1844286	13	James Tafel can match the sheik 's passion for finding a Kentucky Derby winner , but not his bankroll .
2007_05_01_1844286	14	Nearly 25 years ago , Tafel retired as the chairman and chief executive of a publishing company near Chicago and began racing , and then breeding , horses . ''
2007_05_01_1844286	15	You know the appeal of the Kentucky Derby is pretty spectacular and straightforward , '' said Tafel , who is 83 and lives in Boynton Beach , Fla. '' It 's the aspiration of all horsemen to have a horse in the race .
2007_05_01_1844286	16	It 's our gold standard .
2007_05_01_1844286	17	I make the case it 's the greatest race in the world , because if you 're on a plane or waiting in line , and you tell someone you 're in the horse business , the only question they have is , ` Have you won the Kentucky Derby ? ' ''
2007_05_01_1844286	18	Now , the two men are linked .
2007_05_01_1844286	19	On Saturday , Tafel will be in the paddock at Churchill Downs for the Derby with Street Sense , a colt who was the 2-year-old champion last year and will be among the favorites .
2007_05_01_1844286	20	His sire , Street Cry , is owned by Sheik Mohammed , as is the colt 's mother , Bedazzle , who was purchased last year by the sheik 's breeding operation , Darley America .
2007_05_01_1844286	21	The sheik may not have a horse running in the Derby , but his impact on American thoroughbred racing is being felt .
2007_05_01_1844286	22	Another one of the sheik 's Kentucky-based sires , Cherokee Run , is the father of the Derby starter Zanjero .
2007_05_01_1844286	23	If Street Sense or Zanjero wins , Darley America will be able to command bigger breeding paydays for years to come .
2007_05_01_1844286	24	The value of Street Cry , for example , has increased largely because of the accomplishments of Street Sense , who won last year 's Breeders ' Cup Juvenile .
2007_05_01_1844286	25	When Tafel matched Bedazzle with the recently retired Street Cry , he was gambling a $ 30,000 stud fee on a new sire .
2007_05_01_1844286	26	Now , Street Cry stands for $ 50,000 , a figure that will most likely double if Street Sense wins the Derby .
2007_05_01_1844286	27	Last fall , the sheik acknowledged that he had made a mistake by buying too many horses with pedigrees better suited to the turf racing in Europe than the dirt in America .
2007_05_01_1844286	28	Tafel says he understands how Sheik Mohammed has repositioned his operation for a more effective Kentucky Derby run .
2007_05_01_1844286	29	He has done so , too , but on a much smaller scale .
2007_05_01_1844286	30	Tafel culled his broodmares to 6 from 12 ; the sheik has more than 160 in Kentucky . ''
2007_05_01_1844286	31	You get into the racing side of the game , and you end up with some nice fillies or mares , and their value is greater as breeding stock , '' said Tafel , who has had one other Derby horse , Vicar , who finished 18th in 1999 . ''
2007_05_01_1844286	32	So you back into the breeding game , and it sustains the racing operation in lean times . ''
2007_05_01_1844286	33	The making of Street Sense is perhaps further evidence that beating the long odds of getting a horse to the Derby has more to do with luck than with money or strategy .
2007_05_01_1844286	34	In 2002 , Tafel watched as his horse Unshaded , who had won the 2000 Travers Stakes , was trounced by an impressive-looking horse in the Stephen Foster Handicap at Churchill Downs .
2007_05_01_1844286	35	It was Street Cry . ''
2007_05_01_1844286	36	I remembered what a great back end he had and how much balance , '' Tafel said . ''
2007_05_01_1844286	37	It just stuck with me . ''
2007_05_01_1844286	38	When he showed Carl Nafzger , his trainer of 23 years , Street Sense , both men were impressed .
2007_05_01_1844286	39	Here was a perfectly proportioned weanling he had produced in the fields of Kentucky .
2007_05_01_1844286	40	When the offers to buy the yearling began coming in , they knew they had a reason to be impressed . ''
2007_05_01_1844286	41	Well , he was about as perfect a specimen as you 've seen , as a weanling , as a yearling to now , '' Nafzger said . ''
2007_05_01_1844286	42	You could n't buy one that looked this good all the way through . ''
2007_05_01_1844286	43	Tafel has refused to hear any offers for the horse , especially from the sheik , who last year offered $ 17 million to Elizabeth Valando , the owner of Nobiz Like Shobiz , after the colt won a maiden race .
2007_05_01_1844286	44	Valando turned it down , and Nobiz will be among the Derby favorites on Saturday .
2007_05_01_1844286	45	In 2005 , Tafel sold Bedazzle to a group led by Nafzger for $ 180,000 at the Keeneland November breeding stock sale .
2007_05_01_1844286	46	Last fall , after Street Sense ran off to a record 10-length victory in the Breeders ' Cup Juvenile , Nafzger sold the mare to Darley America for an undisclosed price .
2007_05_01_1844286	47	Tafel says he has no regrets .
2007_05_01_1844286	48	In Street Sense , win or lose , he has a valuable stallion prospect .
2007_05_01_1844286	49	A victory Saturday , however , would increase the colt 's value to as much as $ 30 million .
2007_05_01_1844286	50	But that is not what Tafel or , he suspects , Sheik Mohammed views as the point of racing and breeding . ''
2007_05_01_1844286	51	It 's the Kentucky Derby , '' Tafel said . ''
2007_05_01_1844286	52	And just thinking about walking a horse over there as good as this one is more excitement than a guy my age should be able to have . ''
2007_05_01_1844286	53	Beating the Odds Articles in this series are examining the preparation of horses and the motivation of owners and trainers who are striving to win the Kentucky Derby on Saturday .
2007_05_01_1844288	0	The N.C.A.A. quietly passed legislation last week to continue its fight against prep schools that require minimal academic study .
2007_05_01_1844288	1	In perhaps its most significant move to deter diploma mills , the N.C.A.A. will limit high school students to one core course that would count toward college eligibility after a student 's four-year high school graduation date .
2007_05_01_1844288	2	The decision will shut down a glaring N.C.A.A. loophole , one exploited by diploma mills : students avoided graduating high school to pad their grade point average in a fifth year .
2007_05_01_1844288	3	The N.C.A.A. also hopes the new policy will help eliminate schools that exist solely to qualify players for college scholarships . ''
2007_05_01_1844288	4	If you 've been a prep school focused on simply getting kids eligible that are not high school graduates , this is going to be problematic for you , '' the N.C.A.A. vice president Kevin Lennon said .
2007_05_01_1844288	5	College and prep school coaches , however , say the N.C.A.A. 's decision is an overreaction , especially because the number of core courses required by the N.C.A.A. will increase to 16 from 14 in 2008 .
2007_05_01_1844288	6	They say the legislation is detrimental to legitimate prep schools and will limit opportunities to those from poor backgrounds . ''
2007_05_01_1844288	7	It 's a shame to see what we 're doing to young people , and a lot of the young people do n't have the resources , '' the Georgia Tech basketball coach Paul Hewitt said . ''
2007_05_01_1844288	8	We 're slowly but surely taking away the opportunity to overcome a bad start . ''
2007_05_01_1844288	9	Memphis Coach John Calipari , whose team may be ranked No. 1 in the preseason next season , has a significant number of players on his roster who went to prep schools .
2007_05_01_1844288	10	He said that the N.C.A.A. should focus on shutting down illegitimate prep schools and not hurt those attending others . ''
2007_05_01_1844288	11	If you have a problem with some of the prep schools , shut them down , do what you 've got to do , '' Calipari said . ''
2007_05_01_1844288	12	Why blow the whole thing up with a bazooka ?
2007_05_01_1844288	13	I understand what their concern is , but I know that they 've never discussed it with any of us . ''
2007_05_01_1844288	14	Lennon said that coaches were informed of the potential of the new policy at a national coaches meeting and that the issue had been on the N.C.A.A. 's agenda for the past six months .
2007_05_01_1844288	15	The policy follows new rules that will allow the N.C.A.A. to review individual transcripts with academic anomalies and visit questionable schools to determine their legitimacy .
2007_05_01_1844288	16	But coaches at accredited prep schools who have strong academic traditions expressed concern .
2007_05_01_1844288	17	Raphael Chillious , the basketball coach at the South Kent School in Connecticut , predicted that there would be a flood of lawsuits on behalf of students who he said would be '' caught in the blender . ''
2007_05_01_1844288	18	Chillious said that it was common for traditional New England prep schools to '' reclassify '' students , meaning that they would repeat a year of high school to better prepare themselves for college .
2007_05_01_1844288	19	By doing so , those students do not graduate until a fifth year .
2007_05_01_1844288	20	Lennon said there was a waiver process to handle situations in which students were trying to improve themselves at legitimate schools ; the rule was designed to limit schools and athletes from abusing the system .
2007_05_01_1844288	21	( Learning disabled students are not affected by the new legislation . ) ''
2007_05_01_1844288	22	We 're not shutting out opportunity , we 're encouraging better behavior , '' Lennon said .
2007_05_01_1844288	23	He added that '' legitimate prep schools in the business of preparing students for college and wanting to improve their academic portfolio '' would continue to be able to do so .
2007_05_01_1844288	24	Mike Byrnes , the basketball coach at the Winchendon School , a prep school in Massachusetts , said he understood the intent , but was worried about youngsters caught in the middle . ''
2007_05_01_1844288	25	With this and the 16 core courses , you have kids shooting with their left hand instead of right hand , and now they 're supposed to make the basket , '' Byrnes said . ''
2007_05_01_1844288	26	There 's no time for adjustment . ''
2007_05_01_1844288	27	Byrnes also said those benefiting the most from this rule were junior colleges . ''
2007_05_01_1844288	28	They went from eating Caesar salad to prime rib , '' Byrnes said .
2007_05_01_1844288	29	Junior college basketball programs were virtually gutted in the past decade as students took fifth , sixth and sometimes even seventh years of prep school as alternatives to using two years of eligibility at a junior college .
2007_05_01_1844288	30	The last star players to go through junior college and play at four-year colleges were Steve Francis and Shawn Marion . ''
2007_05_01_1844288	31	This puts the focus back on junior college again , where our people are prepared to help these kids , '' said Steve Green , the head coach at South Plains College , a junior college in Texas .
2007_05_01_1844288	32	As both college and prep school coaches become aware of the legislation , the N.C.A.A. could be faced with a backlash . ''
2007_05_01_1844288	33	In theory , this thing is probably the right idea , '' said Bill Barton , the coach at Notre Dame Prep in Fitchburg , Mass. '' But the reality is that you 're hurting a wide spectrum of kids that come from different backgrounds , but most are minority kids from the inner city .
2007_05_01_1844288	34	There has to be a lawsuit in here somewhere . ''
2007_05_01_1844291	0	Terrorist attacks against noncombatants nearly doubled in Iraq from 2005 to 2006 and were up sharply in Afghanistan , with those two countries alone accounting for a 29 percent increase in terrorism worldwide , according to a report released Monday by the State Department .
2007_05_01_1844291	1	The report shows that the two countries where large numbers of American combat troops are deployed are also where terrorism is rising fastest .
2007_05_01_1844291	2	Terrorist attacks are up 91 percent in Iraq and 53 percent in Afghanistan , according to statistics compiled by the National Counterterrorism Center .
2007_05_01_1844291	3	In the rest of the world , total terrorist attacks declined by 3 percent .
2007_05_01_1844291	4	The new statistics record a rise in terrorist attacks on nonmilitary targets globally to 14,338 in 2006 from 11,153 in 2005 , with an increase in deaths to 20,498 from 14,618 .
2007_05_01_1844291	5	But Iraq alone accounted for nearly half of all the attacks and about two-thirds of fatalities , according to the report , '' Country Reports on Terrorism , 2006 , '' posted Monday on the State Department 's Web site .
2007_05_01_1844291	6	The numbers underscore the ineffectiveness of battling terrorism with conventional military means , said John Arquilla , who studies terrorism at the Naval Postgraduate School . ''
2007_05_01_1844291	7	It is most curious that the areas where we have military operations have the most attacks , '' Mr. Arquilla said . ''
2007_05_01_1844291	8	These statistics suggest that our war on global terrorism is not going very well .
2007_05_01_1844291	9	It suggests we need to try a new approach . ''
2007_05_01_1844291	10	The State Department report said that the invasion of Iraq '' has been used by terrorists as a rallying cry for radicalization and extremist activity that has contributed to instability in neighboring countries . ''
2007_05_01_1844291	11	At a news briefing to release the report , Frank C. Urbancic Jr. , the State Department 's acting coordinator for counterterrorism , said the statistics reflected the viral spread of terrorists ' methods .
2007_05_01_1844291	12	In Afghanistan , there has been a rapid rise in suicide attacks mimicking those in Iraq , and methods for making improvised explosive devices have evolved in the face of American moves to counter them . ''
2007_05_01_1844291	13	The terrorists , there 's no question , are intelligent people , and they learn from each other , '' Mr. Urbancic said . ''
2007_05_01_1844291	14	The people in Afghanistan are watching the people in Iraq , the people in Iraq are watching the people elsewhere , and there 's a snowball effect .
2007_05_01_1844291	15	And they work through the Internet , they communicate . ''
2007_05_01_1844291	16	The annual report is the second to follow a controversy over the government 's count of terrorist attacks in 2004 , when the secretary of state at the time , Colin L. Powell , acknowledged that the numbers publicly announced were artificially low .
2007_05_01_1844291	17	The admission followed a critique from two academic experts , Alan B. Krueger , of Princeton , and David Laitin , of Stanford .
2007_05_01_1844291	18	With two years of data compiled using the same definitions and methodology , this year 's State Department report allows a meaningful comparison .
2007_05_01_1844291	19	Mr. Krueger , an economist who has advised the government on the statistical questions since 2004 , said the new methodology has cleared up some confusion . ''
2007_05_01_1844291	20	I 'd give it a B-plus , '' said Mr. Krueger , who is writing a book on the causes of terrorism .
2007_05_01_1844291	21	He said he believes the definition of terrorism used by the National Counterterrorism Center is still too broad , including some assassinations of particular individuals rather than random attacks intended to spread fear .
2007_05_01_1844291	22	Mr. Krueger also said he regretted the fact that the change in methodologies over time has made tracking long-term trends in terrorism very difficult .
2007_05_01_1844291	23	The report lists five countries as '' state sponsors of terrorism '' : Iran , Syria , Sudan , Cuba and North Korea .
2007_05_01_1844291	24	Libya was dropped after more than two decades on the American list , and the report notes that in February , the United States agreed to '' begin the process of removing '' the terrorist sponsor designation from North Korea .
2007_05_01_1844291	25	The report acknowledges the resilience of Al Qaeda , whose leaders , Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahri , are believed to be in hiding in the Pakistan-Afghanistan border area .
2007_05_01_1844291	26	It says the terrorist group has shifted from '' expeditionary '' plots such as the Sept. 11 attacks , in which a team is assembled and sent to another country to carry out the assault , to '' guerrilla '' attacks , using local recruits in the country where the attack takes place .
2007_05_01_1844291	27	Mr. Arquilla said American tactics in some parts of Iraq were beginning to be adjusted to achieve better results , notably in Anbar Province , where American commanders are working closely with Sunni tribal leaders to counter Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia .
2007_05_01_1844291	28	Mr. Urbancic , of the State Department , suggested a shift in tactics in Iraq and beyond . ''
2007_05_01_1844291	29	While killing and capturing key terrorist actors is fundamental in combating terrorism , these actions do not eliminate the threat , '' he said at the briefing . ''
2007_05_01_1844291	30	We must also seek to build trusted networks of governments , private citizens and organizations , multilateral institutions , and business groups that will work collaboratively to defeat the threat from violent extremism and its radical ideology . ''
2007_05_01_1844293	0	Kirk Radomski , the former Mets clubhouse assistant who has admitted selling performance-enhancing drugs to dozens of current and former professional baseball players , testified last Thursday in front of a federal grand jury investigating steroid use in sports .
2007_05_01_1844293	1	Radomski , a personal trainer from Manorville , N.Y. , pleaded guilty to distributing steroids and to money laundering last Friday , and agreed to cooperate with the federal investigation into drugs and baseball .
2007_05_01_1844293	2	He apparently made good on that promise one day earlier , when he met with the same federal grand jury that is investigating the slugger Barry Bonds for perjury .
2007_05_01_1844293	3	Radomski had been charged April 12 , but a federal judge sealed the case until he spoke to the grand jury to protect Radomski from being intimidated or influenced before he spoke to that grand jury , according to The Associated Press , which cited records filed in a San Francisco court .
2007_05_01_1844293	4	John F. Reilly , a Long Island lawyer who is representing Radomski , said that neither he nor his client would discuss the grand jury testimony .
2007_05_01_1844293	5	A spokeswoman for United States Attorney Scott N. Schools also declined to comment .
2007_05_01_1844293	6	Last week 's grand jury testimony connected Radomski to one of the biggest steroid distribution scandals in recent history , the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative case , which became public in 2003 when federal agents raided the Balco offices .
2007_05_01_1844293	7	A search warrant affidavit filed in Radomski 's case named some of Radomski 's clients , but those names were blackened out in the document .
2007_05_01_1844293	8	Still , the affidavit said that Radomski had been distributing performance-enhancing drugs to major league players , including at least one '' who was publicly identified as being associated with Balco Laboratories . ''
2007_05_01_1844293	9	Bonds is the highest-profile player to be linked to Balco , but other players testified in front of the Balco grand jury , including Jason and Jeremy Giambi , Gary Sheffield and Randy Velarde .
2007_05_01_1844293	10	Other players who testified were A. J. Pierzynski , Benito Santiago , Armando Rios , Bobby Estalella and Marvin Benard .
2007_05_01_1844293	11	None of the players have been indicted , but Bonds is being investigated as he continues to march toward Hank Aaron 's career home run record .
2007_05_01_1844293	12	In a telephone interview last Friday , Bonds 's criminal defense lawyer , Michael Rains , said that he had never heard of Radomski . ''
2007_05_01_1844293	13	This has nothing to do with Barry , '' he said .
2007_05_01_1844293	14	When asked about Radomski before a Yankees game last Friday , Jason Giambi also said that Radomski was a stranger to him . ''
2007_05_01_1844293	15	Do n't know who he is , '' Giambi said . ''
2007_05_01_1844293	16	There 's nothing there .
2007_05_01_1844293	17	Sorry , guys . ''
2007_05_01_1844293	18	He added that he was not worried about Radomski telling federal investigators the names of the players to whom he sold anabolic steroids , amphetamines and human growth hormone . ''
2007_05_01_1844293	19	I did what I already did and I moved on , '' Giambi said .
2007_05_01_1844294	0	Democratic leaders in Congress are planning a special ceremony on Tuesday afternoon to send President Bush a bill that sets timetables for troop withdrawal from Iraq .
2007_05_01_1844294	1	The timing is no accident .
2007_05_01_1844294	2	It comes on the fourth anniversary of the day Mr. Bush stood on an aircraft carrier under the banner '' Mission Accomplished '' and declared that major combat operations in Iraq had ended .
2007_05_01_1844294	3	The Democrats ' ceremony , featuring the House speaker , Nancy Pelosi , and the Senate majority leader , Harry Reid , is part of the elaborate political theater at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue surrounding the Iraq spending bill , which is destined to produce only the second veto of Mr. Bush 's presidency .
2007_05_01_1844294	4	But with Mr. Bush planning to spend Tuesday in Florida talking with military commanders , the White House was being coy on Monday about what kind of theatrics of his own -- if any -- he might stage .
2007_05_01_1844294	5	Democrats , however , said they expected the veto to come Wednesday .
2007_05_01_1844294	6	Mr. Bush 's spokesman , Tony Snow , said , '' We 'll make clear what we intend and how we intend to do it at the proper time . ''
2007_05_01_1844294	7	Mr. Bush , speaking to reporters in the Rose Garden after meeting with leaders of the European Union , expressed optimism that the two sides could reach a compromise after his veto , which Democrats concede they will not be able to override . ''
2007_05_01_1844294	8	I believe that there 's a lot of Democrats that understand that we need to get the money to the troops as soon as possible , '' he said , '' and so I 'm optimistic we can get something done in a positive way . ''
2007_05_01_1844294	9	Mr. Bush first exercised his veto last year , when the Republican-controlled Congress sent him a bill to expand federal financing for embryonic stem cell research .
2007_05_01_1844294	10	On that occasion , the president spoke at the White House surrounded by so-called '' snowflake babies , '' those born from frozen embryos and then adopted .
2007_05_01_1844294	11	The spending bill veto would be the first since Democrats took control of Congress this year and would open a new chapter in the confrontation between the legislative and executive branches over the Iraq war .
2007_05_01_1844294	12	The path to legislation the president might sign remained unclear on Monday .
2007_05_01_1844294	13	Mr. Bush has asked Congressional leaders to meet at the White House on Wednesday to discuss the legislation .
2007_05_01_1844294	14	Democrats have already been considering possible alternatives .
2007_05_01_1844294	15	One leading option , put forth by Representative John P. Murtha , Democrat of Pennsylvania , is to pass a measure that includes benchmarks for the Iraqis to advance on establishing a stable government and reconciling ethnic differences .
2007_05_01_1844294	16	That proposal would not include timetables for troop withdrawal -- a move that would anger some in the party 's liberal wing who believe voters gave them a mandate last election to force Mr. Bush to end the war . ''
2007_05_01_1844294	17	These new members are upset , '' Mr. Murtha said . ''
2007_05_01_1844294	18	They were sent here to stop the war .
2007_05_01_1844294	19	This is a very delicate thing that we 're working with . ''
2007_05_01_1844294	20	The bill will be sent to the White House via a legislative courier after Tuesday afternoon 's ceremony .
2007_05_01_1844294	21	After the expected presidential veto , the legislation would return to the House for consideration .
2007_05_01_1844294	22	If the House fails to override the veto , with a two-thirds vote , the legislation is considered dead and the Senate would not try to override the veto .
2007_05_01_1844294	23	Democratic leaders delivered a final argument on Monday for Mr. Bush to sign the bill . ''
2007_05_01_1844294	24	We ask him again to listen to the American people and his own military experts , '' Mr. Reid said on the Senate floor . ''
2007_05_01_1844294	25	We ask that he finally summon the courage to admit his mistakes and take the steps we propose to begin to heal the grave wounds he has caused . ''
2007_05_01_1844295	0	The largest bloc of Sunni Arabs in the Iraqi Parliament threatened to withdraw its ministers from the Shiite-dominated cabinet on Monday in frustration over the government 's failure to deal with Sunni concerns .
2007_05_01_1844295	1	President Bush stepped in to forestall the move , calling one of Iraq 's two vice presidents , Tariq al-Hashimi , a Sunni Arab , and inviting him to Washington , according to a statement issued by Mr. Hashimi 's office and the White House .
2007_05_01_1844295	2	The bloc , known as the Iraqi Consensus Front and made up of three Sunni Arab parties , '' has lost hope in rectifying the situation despite all of its sincere and serious efforts to do so , '' the statement said .
2007_05_01_1844295	3	If the Sunni group followed through on its threat , it would further weaken a government already damaged by the pullout two weeks ago of six cabinet ministers aligned with the renegade Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr and further erode American efforts to promote reconciliation between Sunnis and Shiites .
2007_05_01_1844295	4	Also on Monday , the White House expressed concern about a report in The Washington Post that aides to Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki were involved in the arrests or removal of at least 16 army and police commanders , at least nine of whom are Sunni , who had been fighting Shiite militias . ''
2007_05_01_1844295	5	We 're aware of the reports , we 're concerned about them , and those are the kinds of things we do discuss with the Iraqis that will be a focus of conversations , '' said the White House spokesman , Tony Snow .
2007_05_01_1844295	6	But he added that the Maliki government had taken aggressive enforcement actions in Shiite neighborhoods in the past .
2007_05_01_1844295	7	As the Sunni cabinet ministers were threatening to step down on Monday , bombs and mortars killed at least 22 Iraqis .
2007_05_01_1844295	8	American and Iraqi soldiers squelched a three-pronged attack in Mosul by insurgents who struck at the main American military base , a police station and a provincial government center .
2007_05_01_1844295	9	At least 104 United States service members died in hostile actions in Iraq in April , the highest of any month so far this year .
2007_05_01_1844295	10	Another 13 deaths among other allied forces have been reported , making it the highest monthly death toll for combined allied forces in more than two years .
2007_05_01_1844295	11	Military reporting typically lags at least 24 hours , so the final total for the month could be higher .
2007_05_01_1844295	12	In his phone call with President Bush , Mr. Hashimi '' talked frankly about the faltering political process , '' the statement from his office said .
2007_05_01_1844295	13	The White House , in a statement from the National Security Council , added that the two leaders '' focused on the importance of additional steps in the reconciliation process and the need for all Iraqi parties to come together to overcome common challenges they face . ''
2007_05_01_1844295	14	Gordon D. Johndroe , a White House spokesman , said Mr. Bush invited Mr. Hashimi to the White House for what would be their second meeting there as part of a continuing dialogue with Iraq 's highest-ranking Sunni official .
2007_05_01_1844295	15	If the Sunni bloc pulled its five ministers from the cabinet , it would be a stark reflection of the difficulty Mr. Maliki 's government has had in mustering support from a broad spectrum of Iraqis .
2007_05_01_1844295	16	The Shiite ministers who walked out two weeks ago have yet to be replaced .
2007_05_01_1844295	17	Such a move would also undo some of the work of Zalmay Khalilzad , the former United States ambassador , who spent much of his tenure here persuading Sunnis to participate in the government .
2007_05_01_1844295	18	Neither Mr. Sadr 's bloc nor Mr. Hashimi 's has threatened to pull out of Parliament , so technically the government would remain standing , but further cabinet resignations would seriously undermine efforts to move forward on legislation needed to ensure that Shiites , Sunnis and Kurds all feel they have a stake in the government .
2007_05_01_1844295	19	Members of the Sunni bloc said that they had not yet decided to pull out their ministers but that they were divided between those who wanted to pull out immediately and those who worried that pulling out would diminish the bloc 's influence on government policy even further . ''
2007_05_01_1844295	20	The first group is enraged by what is going on and is pushing for withdrawal , saying that there is no use in staying in the government , '' said Nasir al-Ani , one of the bloc 's 44 representatives in the 275-member Parliament . ''
2007_05_01_1844295	21	The second group takes a rational approach and is not in favor of withdrawing , but prefers to try to work within the government to deal with the problems . ''
2007_05_01_1844295	22	The crisis was set off by what Sunnis describe as a continued lack of services to Sunni areas of Baghdad .
2007_05_01_1844295	23	For months , those areas have been deprived of adequate food rations and hospital supplies .
2007_05_01_1844295	24	But the latest problem takes place against a backdrop of broader , longstanding Sunni concerns .
2007_05_01_1844295	25	Sunni leaders say the government has failed to move forward on an array of issues including legislation to ensure a fair distribution of oil revenue , bringing Sunnis into all levels of government and weeding out Shiite militias within government security forces .
2007_05_01_1844295	26	In the last several days , the Iraqi Army has worsened the situation by occupying one of the few hospitals used by Sunnis in the heavily Shiite east side of Baghdad , according to politicians .
2007_05_01_1844295	27	Doctors at Al Numan hospital said that patients had been frightened by the presence of soldiers and that most had left the hospital . ''
2007_05_01_1844295	28	The problem is not just with the sectarian practices , but with the government 's ineffectiveness , '' said Mr. Ani , who emphasized that he was speaking for himself and not for the bloc . ''
2007_05_01_1844295	29	We see a lot of problems in Karkh on the western side of Baghdad , where the government is invisible , '' he said . ''
2007_05_01_1844295	30	People are suffering and the government can not solve the problems . ''
2007_05_01_1844295	31	A cabinet minister who is not from the Sunni bloc said that Mr. Maliki had failed to make an effort to get the government to work . ''
2007_05_01_1844295	32	He said he was going to appoint new ministers ; he needs to do that , '' said the minister , who asked not to be identified because of the delicacy of the situation . ''
2007_05_01_1844295	33	What is he waiting for ? ''
2007_05_01_1844295	34	The heavily fortified Green Zone , where the American and British Embassies are , suffered its second serious mortar attack in two weeks on Monday night when it was hit by a volley of mortar shells .
2007_05_01_1844295	35	The attack set off sirens , and loudspeakers broadcast messages warning residents that '' cellphones are for emergency use only '' and to '' duck and cover . ''
2007_05_01_1844295	36	There was no immediate information on casualties .
2007_05_01_1844295	37	In Khalis , near the Iranian border , a suicide bomber killed 16 people and wounded 27 when he detonated his explosives next to a funeral tent , the local police said .
2007_05_01_1844295	38	Three people were killed by roadside bombs in Baghdad , and a suicide bomb in the western Baya neighborhood killed one person , according to an Interior Ministry official .
2007_05_01_1844295	39	A suicide car bomb in the Harithia neighborhood killed two people .
2007_05_01_1844295	40	Nine bodies were found in Baghdad , the Interior Ministry official said .
2007_05_01_1844295	41	In Kadhimiya , a Shiite neighborhood , a peaceful demonstration was interrupted by the heavy gunfire of a fight between soldiers at an Iraqi checkpoint and a gunman who had fired at a passing Iraqi Army convoy .
2007_05_01_1844295	42	The shootout may have been tied to repercussions from a raid on Sunday by the American military on the local office of Moktada al-Sadr .
2007_05_01_1844295	43	In the Mosul attacks , insurgents popped out of manholes near the police station and fired rocket-propelled grenades while three suicide car bombs exploded near the station , said Lt. Col. Eric Welsh , commander of the single American combat battalion there .
2007_05_01_1844295	44	An American patrol responding to the attack killed at least six insurgents in a firefight , the colonel said .
2007_05_01_1844295	45	At least one American soldier and four Iraqi policemen were wounded .
2007_05_01_1844295	46	Correction : May 8 , 2007 , Tuesday A front-page article last Tuesday about new sectarian political problems and violence in Iraq misstated the number of United States service members killed from hostile actions in April , as reported by the Defense Department .
2007_05_01_1844295	47	It was 96 -- not 104 , which included eight who died in non-hostile incidents .

2007_05_01_1844296	7	The measure , to take effect in December , will make it illegal for advertisers to misquote reviewers by taking a positive word or phrase from a theater review if it gives a misleading sense of the whole review .
2007_05_01_1844296	8	The Unfair Commercial Practices Directive bars advertising that includes '' false information '' or any claim that '' deceives or is likely to deceive the consumer '' and thus '' causes or is likely to cause him to take a transactional decision that he would not have taken otherwise .

2007_05_01_1844296	9	Helen Kearns , the commission 's spokeswoman on consumer affairs , said the measure would be '' policed on a case-by-case basis '' by the Office of Fair Trading . ''

2007_05_01_1844297	0	CBS 's exclusive interview with the former director of central intelligence George J. Tenet on '' 60 Minutes '' on Sunday might have captivated Washington , but it made only minor ripples in the ratings .

2007_05_01_1844298	2	We 're significantly raising the bar for entrance , '' said Scott Mitchell Rosenberg , the chairman of the company .
2007_05_01_1844298	3	Last year pitches with strong story concepts that were illustrated with stick figures were considered .
2007_05_01_1844298	4	This year the company is seeking a more polished product of completed pages : penciled , inked , lettered and colored .
2007_05_01_1844298	5	In July a panel of judges will narrow the submissions , which last year spanned 12 countries , to 10 .
2007_05_01_1844298	6	Votes cast online will decide the winner , whose story will be published in a graphic novel or comic book in 2008 .

2007_05_01_1844299	0	Less than three weeks after putting the historic headquarters of The New York Times Company on the block , Tishman Speyer Properties sold the building for $ 525 million , three times the $ 175 million it paid in November 2004 .
2007_05_01_1844299	1	The buyer , Africa Israel USA , a subsidiary of an Israel-based international holding and investment company , announced in a statement yesterday that it would invest $ 170 million to renovate the building , at 229 West 43rd Street , for office and retail tenants . ''
2007_05_01_1844299	2	Everyone has been lucky in this market , and this price just confirms that , '' said Dan Fasulo , managing director of Real Capital Analytics , which tracks real estate deals . ''
2007_05_01_1844299	3	It is a nightmare to find prime office space in Midtown , where rents are up 15 to 20 percent in the last three months . ''
2007_05_01_1844299	4	When Tishman Speyer bought the Times Building in 2004 , some real estate executives suggested that it had overpaid .
2007_05_01_1844299	5	But rents have increased relentlessly as vacancy rates have declined . ''
2007_05_01_1844299	6	We are obviously pleased , '' said Robert Speyer , senior managing director of Tishman Speyer , after the deal was reported yesterday in The Wall Street Journal online .
2007_05_01_1844299	7	Mr. Speyer added : '' There is a lot of interest from investors all over the world to own real estate in New York City , and Times Square has become one of the most heated submarkets in the world . ''
2007_05_01_1844299	8	A recent report by Cushman & Wakefield , a real estate broker , said that the average rent for prime office space in Midtown Manhattan had attained a record high of $ 70.77 per square foot .
2007_05_01_1844299	9	In Midtown , '' for anyone looking for a block of space in excess of 300,000 square feet during the next two years for less than $ 100 per square foot , this is your only option , '' said Darcy A. Stacom , the broker at CB Richard Ellis who sold the property for The Times in 2004 and handled the sale to Africa Israel for Tishman Speyer .
2007_05_01_1844299	10	Mr. Fasulo said that the new owners should expect '' above-average rents for the property , given its history and location , '' meaning that tower floors could fetch above $ 75 per square foot and lower floors slightly less .
2007_05_01_1844299	11	The 750,000-square-foot , 15-story Times Building , which opened in 1913 , needs an extensive top-to-bottom refurbishing -- including a renovation of the lobby , the former newsprint loading bays , and the subbasements that once housed the newspaper 's printing presses -- before it can be rented to corporate and retail tenants . ''
2007_05_01_1844299	12	The loading docks will be prime retail space , '' Mr. Fasulo said , '' because that large a space just does n't exist in Times Square . ''
2007_05_01_1844299	13	He added : '' They can get a blue-chip retailer there at a prime price . ''
2007_05_01_1844299	14	The Times Company is in the process of moving into its new headquarters , a skyscraper at 620 Eighth Avenue between 40th and 41st Streets , opposite the Port Authority Bus Terminal .
2007_05_01_1844299	15	In a press release , Africa Israel Investments Ltd. said the property was the most expensive its United States subsidiary had bought in New York City .
2007_05_01_1844299	16	The Israeli billionaire Lev Leviev , as chairman , owns 76 percent of the Africa Israel holding company , '' and is looking to do more deals than this , even on a larger scale , '' said Rotem Rosen , the chief executive of Africa Israel USA .
2007_05_01_1844299	17	Africa Israel had a 50 percent interest in the recent purchase of the Apthorp apartment building on the Upper West Side for $ 426 million . ''
2007_05_01_1844299	18	And we are looking to bring our model in New York to downtown Buenos Aires , buying exclusive properties and upgrading them , '' Mr. Rosen said .
2007_05_01_1844299	19	Africa Israel owns office and residential real estate and shopping malls , and has ventures in hotels , tourism , telecommunications and fashion .
2007_05_01_1844299	20	In recent years the company has become a player with deep pockets not only in New York real estate , but also in Miami , Los Angeles , Las Vegas , Phoenix and Myrtle Beach , S.C. , where , Mr. Rosen said , the company is planning a Hard Rock music park to be completed in 2008 .
2007_05_01_1844300	0	She was putting the finishing touches on a Halloween costume from Cheap Jack 's Vintage Clothing store on Oct. 31 , 2005 , when she heard the pounding at the door of her Chelsea apartment .
2007_05_01_1844300	1	Through the peephole , she saw thick white smoke and a man in full firefighting gear , a plastic visor obscuring his face , who demanded to be let in .
2007_05_01_1844300	2	With no reason to question that he was an actual firefighter , she allowed him in , then followed as he opened windows and complied when he ordered her to put a towel under the door , the 36-year-old woman told a Manhattan jury yesterday on the first day of the sex-abuse and kidnapping trial of Peter Braunstein , a former writer for Women 's Wear Daily .
2007_05_01_1844300	3	As she got her keys and searched for her cat , preparing to flee , she felt a gun at her head , the woman testified in State Supreme Court . ''
2007_05_01_1844300	4	Get down on the ground , '' the man in the firefighter 's gear told her .
2007_05_01_1844300	5	When she did , he tied her wrists with plastic handcuffs and put a chloroform-soaked rag over her mouth . ''
2007_05_01_1844300	6	I immediately passed out , '' she said .
2007_05_01_1844300	7	So began a 13-hour nightmare , the woman said , in which she was sexually tormented by Mr. Braunstein , 43 .
2007_05_01_1844300	8	Prosecutors say Mr. Braunstein was acting out his rage at the fashion industry after being fired from his job and dumped by his girlfriend , the beauty editor at W magazine .
2007_05_01_1844300	9	The victim , who had been a colleague in the Women 's Wear Daily newsroom , was a surrogate target for those grievances , the prosecutor , Maxine Rosenthal , said in her opening statement yesterday .
2007_05_01_1844300	10	A defense lawyer , Celia Gordon , said that Mr. Braunstein was suffering a mental breakdown .
2007_05_01_1844300	11	The victim testified that Mr. Braunstein had stripped her naked and tied her to the bed with a green nylon cord that was connected to her right hand and her left hand and leg .
2007_05_01_1844300	12	Along with the gun , he had a hunting knife , she said .
2007_05_01_1844300	13	A court officer held up a lavender sweatshirt and a pink thong , and the woman said that Mr. Braunstein had cut them off her body .
2007_05_01_1844300	14	He also taped her eyes and mouth with duct tape , she said , and he administered chloroform four more times during the night , although she had taught herself not to inhale the fumes and to feign unconsciousness .
2007_05_01_1844300	15	She said that she could see a little through the tape , but that he wore a ski mask throughout most of the attack .
2007_05_01_1844300	16	He touched her breasts and tried to abuse her further , she said , but when she pretended to regain consciousness , he stopped .
2007_05_01_1844300	17	He offered her cough medicine , saying it would relax her , and swigged some himself , she said .
2007_05_01_1844300	18	Under cross-examination , she said he had cut the cord that was binding one arm when she complained that it hurt and that he held an ice pack on her swollen eye .
2007_05_01_1844300	19	She said she suspected that Mr. Braunstein had beaten her while she was unconscious .
2007_05_01_1844300	20	She said that she tried to '' pacify '' him by talking to him .
2007_05_01_1844300	21	He told her he was Jewish , an only child , and that his birthday was Jan. 26 , born under the sign of Aquarius -- details that would later help the police identify him .
2007_05_01_1844300	22	During the ordeal , she said , friends telephoned and came to the door , but she would not respond , fearing that Mr. Braunstein would hurt them .
2007_05_01_1844300	23	Mr. Braunstein taunted about the calls and visits , she said . ''
2007_05_01_1844300	24	He referenced , ` You 're worse than Paris Hilton , ' '' she recalled .
2007_05_01_1844300	25	He rummaged through boxes of shoes in her closet , and put two pairs of high heels on her feet , a pair of lavender strapped sandals and another pair that she described as bronze colored .
2007_05_01_1844300	26	She had resigned from Women 's Wear Daily , she told the jury , for reselling shoes from the fashion closet , and she realized that her attacker must be someone who had worked there when he offered to disclose who had reported her .
2007_05_01_1844300	27	As dawn broke the following morning , she said , Mr. Braunstein cleaned up the mess he had made and left her naked and tied up .
2007_05_01_1844300	28	She said she used her free hand and her teeth to untie herself and called a friend .
2007_05_01_1844300	29	The friend encouraged her to call 911 .
2007_05_01_1844300	30	When four police officers came to her apartment door , she at first refused to let them in .
2007_05_01_1844300	31	Her trust in men in uniform had been shattered , she said , losing her composure for the only time on the witness stand . ''
2007_05_01_1844300	32	I was scared , '' she said . ''
2007_05_01_1844300	33	I just let a fireman in a couple of hours ago , and I was adamant that no one else in uniform was coming in the house . ''
2007_05_01_1844300	34	Correction : May 4 , 2007 , Friday Because of an editing error , an article on Tuesday about the victim 's testimony in the Manhattan trial of Peter Braunstein , a former magazine writer accused of sexual abuse and kidnapping , misidentified the publication from which the victim , a 36-year-old woman , resigned .
2007_05_01_1844300	35	It was W , not Women 's Wear Daily .
2007_05_01_1844301	0	When 10 of the declared Republican presidential candidates gather for their first debate on Thursday at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Southern California , Fred D. Thompson , the actor and politician , will not be among them .
2007_05_01_1844301	1	But he will not be far offstage .
2007_05_01_1844301	2	Mr. Thompson , the former Tennessee senator and current presidential question mark , is speaking the next night at the annual dinner of the Lincoln Club of Orange County , an influential conservative group .
2007_05_01_1844301	3	The scheduling illustrates the political place Mr. Thompson occupies : he is of the presidential campaign , but not in it .
2007_05_01_1844301	4	Making speeches at carefully chosen appearances , doing an occasional interview and fielding questions from Republican congressmen , Mr. Thompson , 64 , is running something of a guerrilla exploratory effort .
2007_05_01_1844301	5	He even weighed in recently on a conservative blog to offer a detailed defense of his ideas on federalism .
2007_05_01_1844301	6	Behind the scenes , Mr. Thompson has been consulting with his inner circle -- including former Senators Bill Frist and Howard H. Baker Jr. of Tennessee and experienced Washington aides like Mark Corallo , a former Justice Department official -- about how he could pull together the money and staff he would need to run .
2007_05_01_1844301	7	Those supporters have been reaching out privately to potential contributors to make sure they could still tap into the Republican donor base .
2007_05_01_1844301	8	Ted Welch , a Nashville businessman and past fund-raiser for Mr. Thompson , has signed on with Mitt Romney and has indicated he intends to stay there .
2007_05_01_1844301	9	But Mr. Thompson 's supporters said that they thought he could raise the money to be competitive and that they were banking on an Internet effort driven by his star power and dissatisfaction with the current field of candidates .
2007_05_01_1844301	10	The informal Thompson team has kicked around names of potential top campaign aides , lawyers and pollsters who might still be available given that so much of the Republican talent pool has already been scooped up .
2007_05_01_1844301	11	The team has discussed securing office space for a headquarters in Tennessee .
2007_05_01_1844301	12	Mr. Thompson 's disclosure that he was treated for lymphoma was seen as more evidence of presidential preparation .
2007_05_01_1844301	13	And at a private meeting a few weeks ago with House Republicans , he answered questions about his reputation as a man about town during his eight years in the Senate , a period when he was single after his divorce from his first wife .
2007_05_01_1844301	14	Mr. Thompson was asked bluntly if any activities from his first marriage or his time in the Senate would come back to haunt him or his backers .
2007_05_01_1844301	15	According to those attending , Mr. Thompson assured them there were no problems , but conceded that when he was single , '' I chased girls and girls chased me . ''
2007_05_01_1844301	16	Mr. Thompson is since remarried , and he and his wife , Jeri , have two young children .
2007_05_01_1844301	17	Also watching anxiously are the millions of fans of '' Law & Order '' on NBC , the show on which Mr. Thompson plays the fictional prosecutor Arthur Branch .
2007_05_01_1844301	18	The network has not yet announced if it will renew the long-running drama , and it remains uncertain whether equal time issues could spell trouble for the ever-present cable reruns should Mr. Thompson enter the race officially .
2007_05_01_1844301	19	His supporters and others who have met with him are convinced that Mr. Thompson is nearing a decision and is likely to become a candidate in the weeks ahead , a probability they see reflected in the higher public profile he has adopted . ''
2007_05_01_1844301	20	You will see a whole lot of him , '' said Representative Zach Wamp , a Tennessee Republican leading an effort to draft Mr. Thompson . ''
2007_05_01_1844301	21	He has the luxury of getting a lot of national attention without being an announced candidate . ''
2007_05_01_1844301	22	Should he choose to run , Mr. Thompson and his supporters would face the challenge of converting his celebrity profile and Senate experience into a bona fide presidential campaign .
2007_05_01_1844301	23	Veteran Republican strategists say the logistics of the task should not be underestimated . ''
2007_05_01_1844301	24	I just wonder how he is going to start this late and have the campaign infrastructure , local organizations on the ground in the early states and raise the money , '' said Charlie Black , a senior Republican strategist who is backing Senator John McCain . ''
2007_05_01_1844301	25	Celebrity does n't pay for an airline ticket to Des Moines . ''
2007_05_01_1844301	26	Those encouraging Mr. Thompson say his conservative aura and movie star presence will allow him to catch up quickly . ''
2007_05_01_1844301	27	Fred has a commanding personal presence that makes every other politician jealous , '' said Senator Lamar Alexander , Republican of Tennessee . ''
2007_05_01_1844301	28	He attracts people . ''
2007_05_01_1844301	29	Money and organization are not his only obstacles .
2007_05_01_1844301	30	Mr. Thompson would have to demonstrate appeal beyond the South , and overcome a reputation lingering from his Senate service that he does not always put his nose to the grindstone .
2007_05_01_1844301	31	Mr. Thompson 's allies say that if his chief weakness is that he is considered lackadaisical , he can easily overcome that by mounting a strong campaign .
2007_05_01_1844301	32	They say he is taking a typical Thompson approach to his future , examining the options from all angles . ''
2007_05_01_1844301	33	Fred is a big man who moves literally and figuratively at his own pace , he has the appearance of kind of ambling , '' said Tom Ingram , a former political adviser to Mr. Thompson who is a chief aide to Mr. Alexander . ''
2007_05_01_1844301	34	It is part of his charm .
2007_05_01_1844301	35	But people who worked closely with him will tell you he spends hours in his office looking at issues from 360 degrees . ''
2007_05_01_1844301	36	If Mr. Thompson runs , both supporters and potential rivals say he will be an immediate top-tier candidate , not an unreasonable view considering he is performing strongly in polls even though he is not an announced contender .
2007_05_01_1844301	37	Mr. Thompson came into the public eye -- and ear , considering his distinctive voice -- in the early 1970s when he served as Republican counsel to the Senate Watergate committee .
2007_05_01_1844301	38	He then took on some lobbying clients , and was later asked to investigate a parole scandal in Tennessee .
2007_05_01_1844301	39	That episode led to a book and a movie , '' Marie , '' in which Mr. Thompson played himself , kicking off his acting career .
2007_05_01_1844301	40	Elected to the Senate in 1994 to fill the remaining two years of Al Gore 's term after he was elected vice president , Mr. Thompson was seen on Capitol Hill more as an investigator than a legislator .
2007_05_01_1844301	41	While in the Senate , he championed campaign finance reform with Mr. McCain , a position that has produced some anxiety among conservatives who otherwise see him as a welcome alternative to Mr. McCain , Rudolph W. Giuliani and Mr. Romney .
2007_05_01_1844301	42	Since indicating his interest in a presidential bid , Mr. Thompson has also had to push back against challenges to his anti-abortion credentials , but he assured the House members in his session that he was solidly against abortion rights .
2007_05_01_1844301	43	Mr. Thompson , who voted to give President Bush authority to invade Iraq in 2002 , was running for re-election that year but changed his mind after the loss of a daughter , whose death was later attributed to an accidental overdose of prescription drugs .
2007_05_01_1844301	44	The existing campaigns are not eager to criticize Mr. Thompson publicly at this stage .
2007_05_01_1844301	45	He and Mr. McCain were close friends , and Mr. Thompson had a leadership role in Mr. McCain 's White House campaign in 2000 .
2007_05_01_1844301	46	But his own flirtation with a run against Mr. McCain does not appear to have provoked hard feelings so far .
2007_05_01_1844301	47	A top aide for one contender said he thought Mr. Thompson would be stunned by the level of scrutiny he receive in a campaign not only from the news media , but also from the competition .
2007_05_01_1844301	48	He described Mr. Thompson as the potential Wesley Clark of the 2008 race : a popular figure whose political image and skills have not been tested .
2007_05_01_1844302	0	A day after a fiery gasoline tanker crash melted and collapsed a critical highway interchange near the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge , drivers in the Bay Area enjoyed a relatively painless commute on Monday as an expected rush hour nightmare largely failed to materialize .
2007_05_01_1844302	1	But officials warned that things could get worse as repairs continue and the thrill of mass transit fades .
2007_05_01_1844302	2	Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger authorized state funds to pay for a day of free public transit around the bay on Monday , and by and large , traffic around the collapsed overpass was light during the morning and early evening commutes .
2007_05_01_1844302	3	The combination of telecommuting , free rides and good old absenteeism kept many workers off the roads .
2007_05_01_1844302	4	Trains were running half full for much of the day on Bay Area Rapid Transit lines , the region 's light rail system and the additional ferries that plied the waters between San Francisco and the cities on the eastern side of San Francisco Bay had plenty of spare seats . ''
2007_05_01_1844302	5	This morning was one of the easiest commutes I 've ever had , '' said Jared Hirsch , associate production manager for American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco , who drives to work from Oakland . ''
2007_05_01_1844302	6	I think people , assuming that this evening 's would be one of the worst commutes ever , elected to either take public transportation or stay at home . ''
2007_05_01_1844302	7	The evening commute was , in fact , heavier than the morning one , as homebound workers from San Francisco and Silicon Valley traveling off the Bay Bridge to the suburbs east of Oakland were confronted with the collapsed overpass of eastbound Interstate 580 .
2007_05_01_1844302	8	That section of roadway fell on a section of southbound Interstate 880 , a north-south corridor that connects San Jose in the south with cities like Berkeley .
2007_05_01_1844302	9	The two roadways , in the heart of a tangle of freeways at the approach to the bridge known as the MacArthur Maze , are used by an estimated 160,000 cars daily .
2007_05_01_1844302	10	( Westbound 580 and northbound 880 were not damaged . )
2007_05_01_1844302	11	Diverted traffic was spilling into the streets of Oakland , including West Grand Avenue , a four-lane surface street turned potential superhighway .
2007_05_01_1844302	12	Across the bay in San Francisco , Mayor Gavin Newsom said that while '' a very successful effort '' by various regional leaders had made Monday manageable , commuter cooperation was often short-lived . ''
2007_05_01_1844302	13	By no stretch of the imagination is there anyone who believes we are out of the woods , '' Mr. Newsom said .
2007_05_01_1844302	14	And , sure enough , trains , ferries and freeways were fuller in the evening , though patience-trying waits are often the norm in California .
2007_05_01_1844302	15	Still , the lighter-than-normal morning rush kept diverted traffic moving along on Monday . ''
2007_05_01_1844302	16	There 's backup where the detour is coming into the maze , but I would n't call it excessive , '' said Sgt. Les Bishop of the California Highway Patrol . ''
2007_05_01_1844302	17	You are going to have motorists that are relearning the roadways , but I would assume that 's going to smooth out as everybody figures out what the new flow is . ''
2007_05_01_1844302	18	The highway patrol believes that the driver of the tanker , James Mosqueda , 51 , was speeding with a full load of gasoline about 3:42 a.m. when he lost control on a curve , hit a guardrail and flipped the vehicle on to its side .
2007_05_01_1844302	19	The resulting fire , which shot flames high into the early morning sky , buckled a concrete and steel overpass above , sending it crashing onto the highway .
2007_05_01_1844302	20	Mr. Mosqueda , of Woodland , Calif. , remains hospitalized in San Francisco with second-degree burns .
2007_05_01_1844302	21	No other injuries were reported .
2007_05_01_1844302	22	Demolition crews worked through the early hours on Monday picking at the collapsed section of Interstate 580 with backhoes and cranes , working to remove some 700 feet of concrete off the highway below .
2007_05_01_1844302	23	Will Kempton , the director of CalTrans , the state transportation agency , said that after demolition of the upper portion engineers would be able see how much damage had been done to the roadway below . ''
2007_05_01_1844302	24	If we determine there 's structural damage , '' Mr. Kempton said of Interstate 880 , '' all bets are off . ''
2007_05_01_1844302	25	Margena Wade , a spokeswoman for the agency , said that ample news coverage -- some local television stations committed several hours of live coverage to the fire and collapse -- had helped keep road volume down . ''
2007_05_01_1844302	26	I suspect people heard the message , '' said Ms. Wade , standing near a pile of rubble amid the hammering of demolition crews .
2007_05_01_1844302	27	CalTrans would not speculate on either the cost of rebuilding or how long repairs might take .
2007_05_01_1844302	28	Aaron McLear , a spokesman for Mr. Schwarzenegger , said the governor had asked the Federal Highway Administration for financial help for rebuilding .
2007_05_01_1844302	29	The free rides on public transit were for Monday only , though Mr. McLear said the state planned to help pay for whatever additional mass transit was needed .
2007_05_01_1844302	30	For all the preliminary good news , officials in San Francisco and Oakland , the two cities connected by the Bay Bridge , were expecting a wide variety of potential problems in the weeks to come .
2007_05_01_1844302	31	Additional San Francisco police and parking control officers , for example , were being stationed at entrances to the bridge to help guide -- and calm -- drivers . ''
2007_05_01_1844302	32	I definitely anticipate road rage , '' said Kelly Beardall , 37 , a telecom technician who usually drives to work from his home in Walnut Creek , east of Oakland . ''
2007_05_01_1844302	33	When things change like this it takes very little to set people off . ''
2007_05_01_1844303	0	In a small yarn shop near the Virginia Tech campus , Molly Heterick sat knitting at a wooden table with her friends this week , looping coarse strands of wool over her needles until a small patch in the colors of the university started to take shape . ''
2007_05_01_1844303	1	We are so tired of crying , '' said Gina Bonomo , the owner of the Mosaic Yarn Shop . ''
2007_05_01_1844303	2	So we knit , '' said Mrs. Heterick , 69 , never looking up from her work . ''
2007_05_01_1844303	3	This is what we do . ''
2007_05_01_1844303	4	Last week 's mass shooting , in which Seung-Hui Cho killed 32 students and teachers at Virginia Tech , has taken an emotional toll on Blacksburg , which is as intertwined with the university as the knit squares that Mrs. Heterick , Ms. Bonomo and others will sew together into 32 patchwork blankets : one to comfort each family the victims left behind .
2007_05_01_1844303	5	That means they need 2,100 squares .
2007_05_01_1844303	6	But in a town like this , where residents take cake and cookies to welcome new neighbors and some do not bother to lock front doors , there are plenty of volunteers . ''
2007_05_01_1844303	7	It 's like living in a mill town , where every day you go in and work there , '' Ms. Bonomo said . ''
2007_05_01_1844303	8	Even if you do n't know somebody who was shot and killed , you feel like it was someone in your family . ''
2007_05_01_1844303	9	Like many others in this town of about 40,000 , the women at the shop come from generations of family members who have attended or worked at the sprawling university less than a mile from where they sit .
2007_05_01_1844303	10	The tragedy has bound the community like never before , reflecting more than a century of economic , social and historical ties between the university and Blacksburg , which developed around it .
2007_05_01_1844303	11	On downtown North Main Street , most of the businesses -- from burger bars to dry cleaners to pizza parlors -- have put up signs that proclaim Hokie solidarity , invoking the nickname of the university 's students .
2007_05_01_1844303	12	Ribbons in the university 's orange and maroon colors are affixed to lampposts , trees , restaurants , and accountants ' and lawyers ' offices .
2007_05_01_1844303	13	After the killings , residents , students and students ' families who came to Blacksburg wore orange-and-maroon shirts and caps . ''
2007_05_01_1844303	14	Without the university , this whole area would not be what it is , '' said Charlie Whitescarver , associate director of Volume Two Bookstore , which sells university-themed clothing and memorabilia . ''
2007_05_01_1844303	15	If Virginia Tech has something good going on , like a football game , the whole county benefits , '' Mr. Whitescarver said . ''
2007_05_01_1844303	16	If it has a tragedy , the whole county hurts . ''
2007_05_01_1844303	17	After the shootings , classes were canceled for the rest of the week and some students left town , choosing not to return for the rest of the semester .
2007_05_01_1844303	18	But there is no indication that the reduced student body has hurt the regional economy .
2007_05_01_1844303	19	In fact , families who visited Blacksburg to show support appeared to have buoyed business , said Star Boling , manager of the Campus Emporium .
2007_05_01_1844303	20	Ms. Boling 's observation was borne out by the lines of customers at downtown restaurants . ''
2007_05_01_1844303	21	I have never seen such overwhelming support , '' she said . ''
2007_05_01_1844303	22	We are getting new stock in every day .
2007_05_01_1844303	23	We were just cleared out . ''
2007_05_01_1844303	24	But there is still an unsettled air .
2007_05_01_1844303	25	One hotel arranged a comedy show to relieve the mood .
2007_05_01_1844303	26	Fliers advertising counseling services went up in shop windows .
2007_05_01_1844303	27	At least one gun shop owner in nearby Christiansburg said there was an increased interest in handguns .
2007_05_01_1844303	28	After the shootings , the Blacksburg Public Library organized a collection of books to reflect the times , stacking editions of '' Healing a Parent 's Grieving Heart : 100 Practical Ideas After Your Child Dies '' with '' Lost Boy : Why Our Sons Turn Violent and How We Can Save Them '' next to a photograph of hundreds of Virginia Tech students at a candlelight vigil .
2007_05_01_1844303	29	With only one week left of classes this semester , the response to the bloodshed will probably seep into the cultural and intellectual life of the town as time goes on and students return in the fall .
2007_05_01_1844303	30	The town and the university are co-producing an annual arts festival in June , with concerts and cultural events that this year may take on hues of healing . ''
2007_05_01_1844303	31	This is something that is a steppingstone , '' said E. Jane Harrison , the university 's festival producer .
2007_05_01_1844303	32	Set amid gentle hills on a plateau between the Blue Ridge and the Allegheny Mountains , Blacksburg sees its population swell each semester by more than 26,000 students .
2007_05_01_1844303	33	The university has long helped the surrounding area thrive . ''
2007_05_01_1844303	34	We go out and say we have a major research university and we would love your business , '' said Aric H. Bopp , the executive director of the New River Valley Economic Development Alliance . ''
2007_05_01_1844303	35	Being a college town , we are a very international culture , '' Mr. Bopp said . ''
2007_05_01_1844303	36	It 's a huge component of the regional economy . ''
2007_05_01_1844303	37	According to figures provided by a Blacksburg town official , Heather D. Browning , the nearly 22,000 undergraduate students pump more than $ 81 million a year into the local economy and graduate students about $ 45 million .
2007_05_01_1844303	38	About $ 1.2 billion is generated from university-related spending in surrounding Montgomery County .
2007_05_01_1844303	39	In addition , the university has a dedicated following , with up to 60,000 people visiting for football games and patronizing hotels , restaurants and food stores to stock up for tailgating parties .
2007_05_01_1844303	40	University officials say it may be too soon to teach some classes , like those with violent content . ''
2007_05_01_1844303	41	After something like this happens , every element and aspect of campus decisions will be re-examined over a period of time , '' Mark Owczarski , the director of news and information , said when asked if there had been any curriculum changes . ''
2007_05_01_1844303	42	I can assure you every single faculty member is going to be looking at all they have done , '' Mr. Owczarski said . ''
2007_05_01_1844303	43	We owe that to this community to re-examine all that .
2007_05_01_1844303	44	All of those questions : that 's occurring in every corner of this campus . ''
2007_05_01_1844303	45	This year , Virginia Tech accepted 12,848 new students for the fall term .
2007_05_01_1844303	46	In an effort to return to normal , it resumed classes on April 23 and is conducting tours for prospective students .
2007_05_01_1844303	47	Mr. Owczarski said university administrators would not know the full effect of the shootings on admissions until the May 1 deadline for students to accept .
2007_05_01_1844303	48	But he said , '' We have received indications from five students that they will be declining our offer because of last week . ''
2007_05_01_1844303	49	With the economies of the town and the campus inextricably linked , events in one place inevitably reverberate in the other .
2007_05_01_1844303	50	A plan to renovate an 1897 building for the town 's new museum , for example , will be financed by selling parking spaces in Blacksburg to fans attending university football games , said Jessica Wirgau , the museum coordinator . ''
2007_05_01_1844303	51	There is a real sense of community engagement , '' Ms. Wirgau said . ''
2007_05_01_1844303	52	The town melds into the campus . ''
2007_05_01_1844305	0	Paul D. Wolfowitz defended himself vigorously on Monday , declaring that it would be '' unjust and frankly hypocritical '' for the World Bank 's board to find him guilty of ethical lapses .
2007_05_01_1844305	1	But he also hinted that he would discuss whether to resign as bank president if the board cleared him of misconduct .
2007_05_01_1844305	2	Appearing before a committee of the bank 's board of directors and going on the attack after weeks of silence , Mr. Wolfowitz also charged that he had been the victim of '' orchestrated leaks of false , misleading , incomplete and personal information '' intended to '' undermine my effectiveness as president . '' ''
2007_05_01_1844305	3	The goal of this smear campaign , I believe , is to create a self-fulfilling prophecy that I am an ineffective leader and must step down for that reason alone , even if the ethics charges are unwarranted , '' he said . ''
2007_05_01_1844305	4	I , for one , will not give in to such tactics .
2007_05_01_1844305	5	And I will not resign in the face of a plainly bogus charge of conflict of interest . ''
2007_05_01_1844305	6	Mr. Wolfowitz 's lawyer released his client 's comments in a statement on Monday .
2007_05_01_1844305	7	Mr. Wolfowitz 's defiant response left unclear what would happen next , but many at the bank saw it as a prelude to his eventual departure if negotiations could lead to the board 's endorsement of his claim that he had acted in good faith , not favoritism , in arranging for a pay increase for Shaha Ali Riza , his companion , in 2005 .
2007_05_01_1844305	8	She was , at the time , being transferred to the State Department , but continued to receive her salary from the bank .
2007_05_01_1844305	9	The seven-member committee of the bank 's board also heard testimony Monday afternoon from Ms. Riza , who charged that she had been unjustly pushed out of the bank by '' a powerful group '' there that had been hostile to her over other matters .
2007_05_01_1844305	10	Ethics officials ordered Mr. Wolfowitz in 2005 to arrange for her transfer out of the bank with some form of compensation , which ended up being a salary increase and a promotion that have drawn fire from critics .
2007_05_01_1844305	11	Those officials are also to testify before the committee .
2007_05_01_1844305	12	The board committee is to digest the testimony , decide whether Mr. Wolfowitz violated any rules in his direct role in the compensation package , give him a chance to respond , and forward its final recommendation to the 24-member board by Thursday .
2007_05_01_1844305	13	The board could then take action on the matter by the end of the week .
2007_05_01_1844305	14	But some bank officials say there could also be a parallel negotiation with Mr. Wolfowitz .
2007_05_01_1844305	15	Mr. Wolfowitz 's hint that he might be receptive to a deal was in the last paragraph of the seven-page statement released by the office of his lawyer , Robert S. Bennett , shortly after the bank president read it in a private session at the World Bank headquarters in Washington .
2007_05_01_1844305	16	At the end of the day , Mr. Wolfowitz sent it by e-mail to bank employees . ''
2007_05_01_1844305	17	Only when the cloud of these unfair and untrue charges is removed , will it be truly possible to determine objectively whether I can be an effective leader of the World Bank , '' Mr. Wolfowitz said , in what was widely seen at the bank as an indication he would consider resigning .
2007_05_01_1844305	18	The statement appeared to show his recognition of the loss of confidence he has suffered among a growing number of officials , for several reasons .
2007_05_01_1844305	19	Among those reasons have been his crackdown on corruption and his reliance on a small group of close aides brought from the Bush administration , where he had served as deputy defense secretary and an architect of the Iraq war .
2007_05_01_1844305	20	Mr. Wolfowitz has also come under fire as internal documents have surfaced indicating that his aides may have pressed for Bush administration policies downplaying the importance of global warming and opposing contraceptives and abortion in family planning programs .
2007_05_01_1844305	21	Any negotiation about Mr. Wolfowitz 's future would probably include a discussion about preserving the prerogative of the United States to choose the next World Bank president .
2007_05_01_1844305	22	The discussion may also include a compensation package if he resigns , bank officials said .
2007_05_01_1844305	23	Mr. Wolfowitz 's annual salary is $ 400,000 after taxes , according to bank officials .
2007_05_01_1844305	24	The main event of the day was Mr. Wolfowitz 's statement , accompanied by a 17-page submission from his lawyers constituting an extraordinary public rebuttal to accusations that have roiled the bank for three weeks , after his direct role in Ms. Riza 's pay package came to light .
2007_05_01_1844305	25	The White House has consistently supported Mr. Wolfowitz , and on Monday , President Bush did so again , though in a low-key manner . ''
2007_05_01_1844305	26	My position is that he ought to stay , '' Mr. Bush said . ''
2007_05_01_1844305	27	He ought to be given a fair hearing . ''
2007_05_01_1844305	28	He said he did not discuss the matter with the German chancellor , Angela Merkel .
2007_05_01_1844305	29	Mrs. Merkel , who was in town for a European Union meeting with Mr. Bush , in a news conference called only for '' a very transparent , very candid conversation '' about Mr. Wolfowitz 's future .
2007_05_01_1844305	30	European officials say Mrs. Merkel favors Mr. Wolfowitz 's resignation .
2007_05_01_1844305	31	Mr. Wolfowitz 's defense was striking in that it singled out three longtime bank officials as having specifically ordered him to handle Ms. Riza 's compensation package himself in 2005 .
2007_05_01_1844305	32	He said they were Roberto Danino , the general counsel ; Xavier Coll , vice president for human resources ; and Ad Melkert , head of the bank board 's ethics committee .
2007_05_01_1844305	33	Mr. Wolfowitz 's statement appeared to back up a narrative that critics and supporters at the bank said was underlying the crisis .
2007_05_01_1844305	34	According to that narrative , those officials essentially wanted to rid themselves of the matter of Ms. Riza , who felt wronged by being asked to sacrifice to make way for Mr. Wolfowitz , and that it was best left to Mr. Wolfowitz to placate her .
2007_05_01_1844305	35	Mr. Wolfowitz said that contrary to the recollections of some officials at the bank , those officials '' surely knew '' of her salary increase . ''
2007_05_01_1844305	36	Certainly they had access to that information if they wanted it , '' he said . ''
2007_05_01_1844305	37	In sum , in working to resolve the potential conflict of interest that was created by my and Ms. Riza 's relationship , I acted transparently , sought and received guidance from the bank 's ethics committee , and conducted myself in good faith in accordance with that guidance , '' he said .
2007_05_01_1844305	38	Ms. Riza 's salary , in excess of $ 190,000 , is in the same range as that drawn by about 1,000 other bank employees , Mr. Wolfowitz said .
2007_05_01_1844305	39	Mr. Melkert , in a statement on Monday , challenged Mr. Wolfowitz 's recollections and said he was not aware of the amount of Ms. Riza 's compensation when he declared in 2005 and in early 2006 that the matter was settled to his satisfaction .
2007_05_01_1844305	40	He is to testify before the board 's committee on Tuesday , officials said .
2007_05_01_1844305	41	Allegations that Mr. Melkert was '' aware of or had somehow approved the specifics '' of her pay and relocation '' are false , '' said a statement issued by his office at the United Nations Development Program , where he is a top official .
2007_05_01_1844305	42	Late Monday night , Mr. Danino , the former general counsel , also disputed Mr. Wolfowitz 's recollection of events , saying he had no role in determining Ms. Riza 's salary and believed it was a conflict of interest for the bank president to decide it .
2007_05_01_1844306	0	A Halliburton executive , facing withering criticism from Democratic lawmakers during a Senate hearing on Monday about the company 's business dealings in Iran , insisted that the firm had not broken any laws .
2007_05_01_1844306	1	The official , Sherry Williams , a Halliburton vice president and corporate secretary , said the company had consulted several law firms in 1995 after sanctions were imposed on Iran .
2007_05_01_1844306	2	Officials of the company , which recently announced it was moving its chief executive from Houston to Dubai and establishing a corporate headquarters there , determined that it was legal for independent foreign subsidiaries of United States companies to do business there , she said . ''
2007_05_01_1844306	3	We have followed U.S. law , '' she said . ''
2007_05_01_1844306	4	We will continue to follow U.S. law . ''
2007_05_01_1844306	5	Although the three Democratic senators on hand repeatedly suggested broader concerns than strict legality should have prompted the company to halt its business in Iran , Ms. Williams expressed no regret for the firm 's work there .
2007_05_01_1844306	6	From 1995 to 2000 , Vice President Dick Cheney was Halliburton 's chairman ; at the time he spoke out against sanctions on Iran .
2007_05_01_1844306	7	Halliburton announced recently that it had completed its outstanding contracts in Iran and was leaving the country , fulfilling a promise it made in 2005 to wrap up its work there .
2007_05_01_1844306	8	Senator Frank R. Lautenberg , a New Jersey Democrat who has helped lead the investigation into the company 's work in Iran , said Halliburton effectively financed terrorism by doing business there . ''
2007_05_01_1844306	9	Companies that help terrorist states generate revenues that are helping fund terrorist operations , '' he said . ''
2007_05_01_1844306	10	It 's that simple . ''
2007_05_01_1844306	11	Senator Byron L. Dorgan , chairman of the Senate subcommittee that convened the hearing , was similarly blunt . ''
2007_05_01_1844306	12	Was there any discussion about whether from a values standpoint doing business through a foreign subsidiary with a prohibited country like Iran was in fact helping the terrorists ? ''
2007_05_01_1844306	13	he asked Ms. Williams .
2007_05_01_1844306	14	Ms. Williams said she was '' not a part of those discussions . ''
2007_05_01_1844306	15	She cited an array of factors driving the decision to leave Iran , including the difficulty of working in the country and diminishing business there .
2007_05_01_1844306	16	Senator Sherrod Brown , an Ohio Democrat , said he was incredulous that the reasons did not include '' anything to do with patriotism or anything to do with the values that I think our country holds dear . ''
2007_05_01_1844306	17	In 2004 , the Department of Justice began an investigation of the company 's work in Iran , which Ms. Williams said she believed was continuing .
2007_05_01_1844306	18	Federal law generally prohibits United States companies from doing business with countries , like Iran , that are on a State Department list as sponsors of terrorism .
2007_05_01_1844306	19	But a gap in the law when it comes to Iran allows foreign subsidiaries of American corporations to do business there as long as they operate independently .
2007_05_01_1844306	20	Halliburton 's work in Iran was carried out under the name of a subsidiary registered in the Cayman Islands with headquarters in Dubai : Halliburton Products and Services Limited .
2007_05_01_1844306	21	Mr. Lautenberg has introduced legislation to close the loophole for foreign subsidiaries .
2007_05_01_1844306	22	Meanwhile , Mr. Brown and Mr. Dorgan have introduced a bill to prohibit the awarding of government contracts to any company doing business with state sponsors of terrorism .
2007_05_01_1844306	23	The senators pressed Ms. Williams about whether Halliburton 's subsidiary in Iran was truly independent of the parent company , citing a '' 60 Minutes '' report in 2004 that found the Cayman Islands address for the subsidiary was little more than a mail drop and that in Dubai it shared office space , phone and fax lines with a division of Halliburton .
2007_05_01_1844306	24	But Ms. Williams said the Cayman Islands registration was '' perfectly appropriate under the law . ''
2007_05_01_1844306	25	She noted that Halliburton itself was registered in Delaware , even though it has no offices there .
2007_05_01_1844306	26	As for the Dubai office , she said that work for the subsidiary actually took place at a different location .
2007_05_01_1844306	27	Even the telephone number for the subsidiary listed in the phone book '' is actually incorrect , '' she said .
2007_05_01_1844306	28	She described the address visited by '' 60 Minutes '' as a '' registration office '' that the subsidiary used when it was changing its names at one point .
2007_05_01_1844306	29	But Mr. Lautenberg produced documents from an Iranian oil subsidiary that were addressed to the Halliburton subsidiary at the same address in Dubai , which he said cast doubt on her statements .
2007_05_01_1844306	30	William C. Thompson Jr. , the New York City comptroller who runs several city pension funds that invest in Halliburton , has pressed vigorously in the past few years for the company and others to stop doing business in Iran . ''
2007_05_01_1844306	31	Unfortunately , it 's become clear over a period of years that while things may be legal , it does n't mean that they are ethical , '' he said at the hearing . ''
2007_05_01_1844306	32	And I believe that unless you close the loophole , companies will continue to attempt to do business in backdoor fashions . ''
2007_05_01_1844308	0	Home plate at Citi Field in Flushing is marked by a patch of Astroturf .
2007_05_01_1844308	1	In the Bronx , an outcropping of New York schist was leveled by chisel hammers attached to earth movers to clear the land for the future home plate at the new Yankee Stadium .
2007_05_01_1844308	2	The pitcher 's mound in the Bronx will be where a yellow Dumpster rests , while a steel span in Flushing that emulates the Hell Gate bridge over the East River will soon support the concourse in right-center field .
2007_05_01_1844308	3	The Mets and the Yankees are racing to open their new stadiums by opening day 2009 .
2007_05_01_1844308	4	Those passing the construction sites -- huge rocky pits that are filled with cranes , earth movers , steel , giant pieces of precast concrete -- see the concrete frame of one stadium rising in the Bronx over former parkland and another one of steel ascending over parking spaces beside Shea Stadium . ''
2007_05_01_1844308	5	This place is so big , so wide open now , but when it 's filled with grass and seats , it will envelop you , '' said Jeff Wilpon , the chief operating officer of the Mets , as he walked through the Citi Field site during a recent tour .
2007_05_01_1844308	6	Behind him , Shea remains , a vestige of an unadventurous period in sports architecture . ''
2007_05_01_1844308	7	A dull , dingy place , '' Wilpon said .
2007_05_01_1844308	8	In his office , Wilpon keeps a miniature replica of Ebbets Field , a daily reminder of the architectural muse of Citi Field .
2007_05_01_1844308	9	It includes the rotunda through which Brooklyn Dodgers fans , including his father , Fred , the Mets ' principal owner , used to enter .
2007_05_01_1844308	10	He removed the tiny rotunda piece from the rest of the model and said , '' Fred can tell us how it used to smell in there . ''
2007_05_01_1844308	11	A reimagined rotunda , which will be named for Jackie Robinson , is also beginning to take shape ; so is the footprint of the Great Hall , a meeting place , among other things , through which many of the fans visiting the new Yankee Stadium will enter .
2007_05_01_1844308	12	It will stand 60 feet high and span left field to right field , along 161st Street , from Jerome Avenue to River Avenue . ''
2007_05_01_1844308	13	It will be unparalleled , similar in scope to the Grand Central Station waiting room , '' said Valerie Peltier , a managing director for development of Tishman Speyer , on a tour of the Yankee Stadium site last week .
2007_05_01_1844308	14	Tishman Speyer is overseeing construction of the $ 800 million stadium .
2007_05_01_1844308	15	Jerry Speyer , the company 's president , is on the board of Yankee Global Enterprises .
2007_05_01_1844308	16	Executives from each team said that they were not competing with each other over who would have the better ballpark .
2007_05_01_1844308	17	It is almost enough that the deals were made , with city and state contributions for infrastructure and other nonconstruction costs , to let the teams build new ballparks .
2007_05_01_1844308	18	Since 1991 , 18 new major league stadiums have been built . ''
2007_05_01_1844308	19	After nothing happening for 15 or 20 years , it 's all happening here in the same time period , '' said Dave Howard , an executive vice president of the Mets .
2007_05_01_1844308	20	Beside the ballparks , the Devils ' arena in Newark is nearly done , the Jets and the Giants are planning construction of their shared Meadowlands stadium , and the Nets hope to start building their arena in Brooklyn soon .
2007_05_01_1844308	21	The first level of the steel structure in Flushing is nearly in place , with yellow caution tape flapping in the wind , affording a raw view of a design fiat : fans will be able to see the field nearly anywhere they walk along the 40-foot-wide concourses , except from behind the Sterling luxury boxes that are 18 rows from field level , a club on the Promenade level and a restaurant in left field . ''
2007_05_01_1844308	22	In the old stadiums , nobody thought about that , '' Wilpon said .
2007_05_01_1844308	23	Three levels of concrete structure are in various stages of completion at the new Yankee Stadium , more along right field than left .
2007_05_01_1844308	24	Rakers , 40-foot pieces of steel onto which the seats will be installed , will be arriving next week .
2007_05_01_1844308	25	A crane to handle the steel is being assembled .
2007_05_01_1844308	26	The construction already obscures a portion of the rusted elevated train tracks and takes place around a New York City Transit substation that will eventually be blocked by the giant outfield scoreboard .
2007_05_01_1844308	27	Nascent dugouts are visible in little excavations several feet below field level across a rocky landscape from which 350 cubic yards of dirt were removed before construction began .
2007_05_01_1844308	28	The future site of Monument Park is below a platform that supports several office trailers . ''
2007_05_01_1844308	29	The most interesting thing to me , '' said Lonn Trost , the chief operating officer of the Yankees , looking over the site , '' is to take the tradition of Yankee Stadium , replicate it here , and provide fans with something new . ''
2007_05_01_1844308	30	The new stadium will have the same field dimensions as the current one , with more seats angled to the infield .
2007_05_01_1844308	31	It will also resurrect the original exterior with limestone , concrete and granite , and recreate the frieze that ringed the stadium , with 39 sections of white-painted steel weighing six tons each , to be made in Quebec .
2007_05_01_1844308	32	The new frieze should not turn green in the air , as did the old copper one , which was removed in the 1974-5 stadium renovation .
2007_05_01_1844308	33	Some of the 24,000 pieces of precast concrete that will comprise the Citi Field exterior are already in Flushing , some weighing 1,000 pounds .
2007_05_01_1844308	34	The front of each piece is covered with bricks , which are sliced lengthwise to reduce the weight yet create the impression of a brick facade .
2007_05_01_1844308	35	It is so different in architectural ambition and style from the original Shea design of blue and orange tiles arranged over exposed ramps . ''
2007_05_01_1844308	36	By the end of this season , most of the exterior facade will be in place , '' Howard said . ''
2007_05_01_1844308	37	It will look like the virtual model we have online . ''
2007_05_01_1844308	38	Shea still serves a purpose , beyond housing the Mets for two more seasons , and it is not simply to underscore the limits of the dual-purpose stadiums .
2007_05_01_1844308	39	Inside an unused section of the World 's Fair-era hulk , the Mets have built a showroom that depicts what the 10 Sterling and 40 Excelsior luxury suites will look like ( the former will have bathrooms modeled on the Four Seasons restaurant 's ) .
2007_05_01_1844308	40	Various types of seats can be tested for comfort .
2007_05_01_1844308	41	The team is also using the showroom to assess carpeting , tile , color and other design schemes -- Jeff Wilpon , who grew up in the family 's real estate development business , can offer a spiel about terrazzo floors -- for the suites , clubhouses and concourses .
2007_05_01_1844308	42	The concourses may have glazed wall tile . ''
2007_05_01_1844308	43	I want to know what we 've designed before we sell it , '' Wilpon said .
2007_05_01_1844308	44	The $ 600 million stadium will reflect its era , as its predecessor did .
2007_05_01_1844308	45	Shea 's opening was envisioned for 1962 , the Mets ' inaugural season , but after delays , it took about two more years to complete .
2007_05_01_1844308	46	The original Yankee Stadium took an astonishingly quick 284 days to finish in time , providing the team with a home of its own after being told to leave the Polo Grounds . ''
2007_05_01_1844308	47	How often do you get to build Yankee Stadium ? ''
2007_05_01_1844309	0	Responding to Viacom 's $ 1 billion copyright infringement suit over video clips on YouTube , Google said Monday that it would not back off , declaring that the law was on its side . ''
2007_05_01_1844309	1	We are not going to let this lawsuit distract us , '' Michael Kwun , managing counsel for litigation at Google , told reporters .
2007_05_01_1844309	2	In its response to the lawsuit , filed Monday in Federal District Court in Manhattan , Google said that Viacom 's claims were unfounded and asked for a judgment dismissing the complaint .
2007_05_01_1844309	3	In March , Viacom , the parent company of MTV , Comedy Central and Nickelodeon , sued Google and YouTube , the video sharing site it acquired last year , saying they were deliberately building a business on a library of copyrighted video clips without permission .
2007_05_01_1844309	4	Earlier this year , Viacom had asked YouTube to take down 100,000 clips that it said infringed on its copyrights .
2007_05_01_1844309	5	Google 's court filing gives few new details of its legal thinking , which relies heavily on the so-called '' safe harbor '' provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act , enacted in 1998 .
2007_05_01_1844309	6	Those provisions generally hold that Web sites ' owners are not liable for copyright material uploaded by others to their site as long as they promptly remove the material when asked to do so by the copyright owner .
2007_05_01_1844309	7	The 1998 law '' balances the rights of copyright holders and the need to protect the Internet as an important new form of communication , '' Google said in its filing . ''
2007_05_01_1844309	8	By seeking to make carriers and hosting providers liable for Internet communications , Viacom 's complaint threatens the way hundreds of millions of people legitimately exchange information , news , entertainment , and political and artistic expression . ''
2007_05_01_1844309	9	Viacom said Google 's response misses the mark . ''
2007_05_01_1844309	10	This response ignores the most important fact of the suit , which is that YouTube does not qualify for safe harbor protection under the D.M.C.A. , '' Viacom said . ''
2007_05_01_1844309	11	It is obvious that YouTube has knowledge of infringing material on their site , and they are profiting from it . ''
2007_05_01_1844309	12	Mr. Kwun , the Google lawyer , said there had been no talks between Google and Viacom to discuss a settlement . ''
2007_05_01_1844309	13	We feel pretty confident about the case and are ready to take it to court , '' he added .
2007_05_01_1844309	14	In the suit , Viacom had complained that it was unfairly forced to devote significant resources to police YouTube . ''
2007_05_01_1844309	15	Every day we have to scour the entirety of what is available on YouTube , so we have to look for our stuff , '' Philippe P. Dauman , Viacom 's chief executive , said in an interview earlier this year .
2007_05_01_1844309	16	In recent weeks , Google 's chief executive , Eric E. Schmidt , has said that the company will soon unveil new tools that will make it easier for copyright owners to spot their content on YouTube .
2007_05_01_1844309	17	Mr. Schmidt had said that those tools , to be called Claim Your Content , will make Viacom 's complaint moot .
2007_05_01_1844309	18	But Mr. Kwun said on Monday that Google was not compelled by law to develop those tools or to make them available to content owners .
2007_05_01_1844309	19	The first case management conference , at which the judge may set an initial timeline for the trial , is scheduled for July 27 , Mr. Kwun said .
2007_05_01_1844309	20	Google has asked for a jury trial .
2007_05_01_1844309	21	Yahoo and Comcast in Deal By Reuters The cable TV provider , the Comcast Corporation , and the Internet media company Yahoo said yesterday that they had agreed to a multi-year partnership for Yahoo to supply Web advertising to Comcast .
2007_05_01_1844309	22	The deal covers online display and video advertising to be featured on the site Comcast.net , which has 15 million monthly visitors , the companies said .
2007_05_01_1844309	23	The deal is the latest in a string that Yahoo has signed to supply media players with online advertising services .
2007_05_01_1844309	24	Yahoo wants to show that its own upgraded Web search advertising system , dubbed Panama , is gaining momentum against Google , the pay-per-click Web ad leader .
2007_05_01_1844310	0	The docket in front of Justice Mark G. Farrell one recent Tuesday afternoon looked like a routine roster of small-time crime : petty larceny , attempted burglary , check forgery .
2007_05_01_1844310	1	But the offenders shared a single motivation : money to gamble .
2007_05_01_1844310	2	Such is the criminal parade in the country 's first and only gambling treatment court .
2007_05_01_1844310	3	Following the model of about 2,000 '' therapy courts '' devoted to drugs and spousal abuse that have opened nationwide in the last two decades , the setup here allows defendants to avoid jail time if they follow a court-supervised program that includes counseling sessions , credit checks and twice-monthly meetings with Justice Farrell . ''
2007_05_01_1844310	4	I realize this is demanding , '' the judge said the other day as he ordered Andrew Hallett , 19 , who forged his father 's checks to feed a bingo and lottery addiction , to attend Gamblers Anonymous meetings twice a week . ''
2007_05_01_1844310	5	If you continue to apply yourself to the program , and you continue to go to the self-helps , we 'll get you through it . ''
2007_05_01_1844310	6	Mirroring the rise in gambling nationally and the opening of two new casinos near this suburb of Buffalo , the court 's caseload has grown steadily since it opened in 2001 , to several dozen cases a year from a handful .
2007_05_01_1844310	7	And as gambling has become more popular , with the growth of online poker and with New York State lottery revenues nearly doubling to $ 6.8 billion over the past six years , Justice Farrell 's docket includes middle-aged parents with college degrees and steady jobs as well as young drug users with criminal records . ''
2007_05_01_1844310	8	Gambling has become almost a genre in our society , '' said Justice Farrell , who lectures defendants with a stern voice and a no-nonsense tone .
2007_05_01_1844310	9	A majority of the gamblers he sees can hold their own , he said , '' but it 's the 5 percent that have problems , and we 're seeing an expression of it in gambling court . ''
2007_05_01_1844310	10	The gambling court is too small and too young to show statistically significant results , but its staff members say that more than half the 100-plus defendants so far have completed the treatment program , and only one has been arrested again -- on an offense not connected to gambling .
2007_05_01_1844310	11	But drug courts have shown some impressive results : a 2003 study in Washington State found that participants were 13 percent less likely to become repeat offenders than defendants who went through the regular criminal system , saving $ 3,759 per participant in potential administrative costs and $ 3,020 in costs to victims .
2007_05_01_1844310	12	The idea of expanding therapeutic courts to problem gamblers seems to be gaining momentum .
2007_05_01_1844310	13	Judges and lawyers in Buffalo have recently started steering gambling-related cases toward Amherst , and Justice Farrell has been in demand on the speaking circuit , talking about the program to prosecutors , counselors and other officials in 15 states since 2002 .
2007_05_01_1844310	14	Don E. Dutton , commissioner of the New Mexico Gaming Control Board , said a statewide task force there plans to recommend the start of such a diversion program by year 's end .
2007_05_01_1844310	15	Jeffrey J. Marotta , who manages the Oregon Problem Gambling Services in that state 's Department of Human Services , said his agency expects to start a pilot program soon .
2007_05_01_1844310	16	And in Louisiana , the state attorney general in 2004 set up a diversion program in which gamblers charged with nonviolent crimes can avoid trial if they get treatment .
2007_05_01_1844310	17	Keith S. Whyte , executive director of the National Council on Problem Gambling , said California and Illinois have expressed interest in starting gambling courts .
2007_05_01_1844310	18	Also , Arizona trains its probation officers to watch for problem gamblers .
2007_05_01_1844310	19	Justice Farrell , a 59-year-old lawyer , has spent about 35 hours a week since 1994 running Amherst Town Court .
2007_05_01_1844310	20	With 43,000 cases a year , it is one of the larger of New York 's approximately 1,250 town and village courts , which handle two million criminal , domestic-violence , landlord-tenant , traffic and other cases each year .
2007_05_01_1844310	21	Justice Farrell started a diversion program from drug crimes in 1996 , and for domestic violence in 1999 .
2007_05_01_1844310	22	Justice Farrell , who said he will visit local casinos a few times a year , '' lose $ 100 and figure out what kind of idiot I was , '' noticed the spike in gambling-related crime by looking for warning signs similar to those he saw with drug addiction and domestic violence .
2007_05_01_1844310	23	In a two-and-a-half-week span a few years ago , he said , he saw a dozen cases of car theft , larceny and other crimes committed by otherwise unlikely suspects , and called in experts who determined that gambling was the common theme .
2007_05_01_1844310	24	Soon , the gambling court was born .
2007_05_01_1844310	25	As with drugs and domestic violence , the gambling defendants must plead guilty to be eligible for the diversion program , which gives Justice Farrell broad discretion to defer punishment for up to a year and dismiss charges for those who complete the prescribed treatment regimen .
2007_05_01_1844310	26	But he said gambling can be more complicated , because the connections to the crimes are indirect .
2007_05_01_1844310	27	For example , there is no urine test to identify gamblers , and society generally treats addiction to cards or dice as a character flaw rather than a psychological disorder . ''
2007_05_01_1844310	28	People are more likely to admit they are a heroin addict than a gambling addict , '' Justice Farrell said .
2007_05_01_1844310	29	So the judge and his staff members screen defendants after arraignments by asking those accused of , say , check forgery , why they needed the money .
2007_05_01_1844310	30	Court-appointed counselors look for signs of impulsiveness and weak self-control .
2007_05_01_1844310	31	The gambling court meets every other Tuesday for an hour -- just before the much busier drug court session -- and on one recent afternoon it started by distributing leaflets on gambling addiction to all the defendants .
2007_05_01_1844310	32	Then the defendants heard from Karreen Kelly , a graduate of the drug court program after an arrest for driving while intoxicated , who said she spent '' two years drinking in my bedroom '' to deal with her husband 's compulsive betting .
2007_05_01_1844310	33	Mrs. Kelly , who is 45 and works in retailing , said that constant calls from loan sharks and credit-card companies , and the loss of more than $ 160,000 , led her to consider suicide with a bottle of tranquilizers and a 12-pack of beer . ''
2007_05_01_1844310	34	When he started gambling , I did n't think anything of it , '' she said between sobs . ''
2007_05_01_1844310	35	I had no time because I was working and with kids . ''
2007_05_01_1844310	36	Over the hourlong session , a young woman numbly admitted that she had relapsed , both using drugs and buying daily scratch-off lottery tickets .
2007_05_01_1844310	37	A man in sweat pants told a story about '' replacing one addiction with another , '' explaining that he had recently been in jail and found himself losing $ 400 gambling with cellmates .
2007_05_01_1844310	38	In another case , a man whose habits included sports betting , dice and animal fights had missed a scheduled counseling session . ''
2007_05_01_1844310	39	You need to be where you 're scheduled to be , '' Justice Farrell warned him . ''
2007_05_01_1844310	40	You play ball with me , I 'll play ball with you . ''
2007_05_01_1844310	41	Mr. Hallett , pencil-thin under a puffy ski jacket , started playing bingo at church before he turned 12 , experimented with slot machines while on a cruise and soon was buying 15 to 20 lottery tickets at a time while also sneaking out for bingo . ''
2007_05_01_1844310	42	It was like a rush of adrenaline , '' he recalled . ''
2007_05_01_1844310	43	You 're hooked on that feeling . ''
2007_05_01_1844310	44	Mr. Hallett said he drained his bank account , then manipulated accounts at the doctor 's office where he worked , to keep finding the money to gamble .
2007_05_01_1844310	45	When he was fired , he took a job at Target and soon was caught stealing gift cards .
2007_05_01_1844310	46	He sold his stepsister 's DVDs , prompting his father to put locks on the bedroom doors .
2007_05_01_1844310	47	Then his father had him arrested this year for forging checks .
2007_05_01_1844310	48	Judith Munzi , a gambling recovery counselor at Jewish Family Service of Buffalo and Erie County , stood with Mr. Hallett in court and told Justice Farrell that the young man was a motivated patient , but that he suffers from attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and may need to change his medication . ''
2007_05_01_1844310	49	The judge makes you not want to do something , '' Mr. Hallett said afterward , vowing to stay out of trouble .
2007_05_01_1844310	50	The three therapeutic courts , run under the broader auspices of the town court system , which pays the judge 's $ 69,500 annual salary , receive about $ 50,000 a year in grants and donations to cover the cost of urine tests , educational materials , computers , travel expenses and overtime for police officers who search for defendants with outstanding warrants .
2007_05_01_1844310	51	Treatment costs are separate .
2007_05_01_1844310	52	While Justice Farrell 's court handles only misdemeanors involving $ 1,000 or less , or felonies in which charges were reduced through plea bargains , the authorities here have also seen a rise in more serious offenses rooted in gambling .
2007_05_01_1844310	53	John C. Doscher , chief of the white-collar crime bureau in the Erie County district attorney 's office , said his group has convicted nine people of stealing $ 100,000 or more in gambling-related crimes since 2005 .
2007_05_01_1844310	54	Among them was Judith Ann Scheitheir , who pleaded guilty in January to stealing $ 350,000 from the plant nursery where she worked to cover her credit-card debts and losses at casinos in Niagara Falls and Ontario .
2007_05_01_1844310	55	And Kenneth Mangione , chief financial officer at a boarding school for troubled children , was sentenced in March to six months in jail and ordered to repay $ 50,000 after he confessed to stealing almost $ 200,000 from the school to cover gambling losses .
2007_05_01_1844310	56	When asked where the stolen money was , Mr. Doscher recalled that Mr. Mangione told prosecutors , '' It 's at the casino . ''
2007_05_01_1844310	57	In gambling court , where Justice Farrell presides in front of a floor-to-ceiling mural that includes the American flag and a bald eagle , the numbers are smaller , but the stories are similar .
2007_05_01_1844310	58	Experts said that therapeutic courts remain a rarity because many judges consider them an administrative burden , lawyers are often wary of letting their clients admit to an addiction on top of any particular crime , and financing is scarce . ''
2007_05_01_1844310	59	The easier thing to do is to sit back and see if it works elsewhere , '' said Carson Fox , director of operations at the National Association of Drug Court Professionals .
2007_05_01_1844310	60	It seems to be working for an up-and-coming boxer identified in court as Leslie R .
2007_05_01_1844310	61	After being arrested for petty larceny , he recently completed a year of treatment .
2007_05_01_1844310	62	Justice Farrell gave the boxer a certificate and a key chain with the inscription , '' Amherst Court : Where Treatment and Justice Meet , '' along with a copy of '' The Little Engine That Could , '' the classic children 's book . ''
2007_05_01_1844310	63	I think Judge Farrell is very strict , but he 's fair , '' Leslie R. said . ''
2007_05_01_1844310	64	I do n't plan to be back here again . ''
2007_05_01_1844311	0	George Steinbrenner made it clear yesterday that he was not ready to fire anybody after 23 games .
2007_05_01_1844311	1	But with 14 losses already , and a pitching staff that has been exposed as inferior to that of the Boston Red Sox , it is convenient that the Yankees play in Texas this week .
2007_05_01_1844311	2	Texas , of course , is the home state of Roger Clemens , the man with more victories than any living pitcher .
2007_05_01_1844311	3	By the end of the month , Clemens is expected to decide whether to continue his career .
2007_05_01_1844311	4	With Brian Cashman , the Yankees ' general manager , along for this trip , it is easy to imagine a meeting in Houston . ''
2007_05_01_1844311	5	None of us will be in Arlington , '' Clemens 's agent , Randy Hendricks , said in an e-mail message yesterday when asked about a possible meeting between Clemens and Cashman . ''
2007_05_01_1844311	6	Beyond that , I should not comment . ''
2007_05_01_1844311	7	Reached by telephone yesterday right before the Yankees ' charter took off from Newark Liberty International Airport , Cashman was vague about his reasons for traveling with the team , which Cashman rarely does . ''
2007_05_01_1844311	8	We talked about what was best right now and we all agreed it was best for me to be here with the team , '' said Cashman , who canceled a trip to the Dominican Republic .
2007_05_01_1844311	9	Steinbrenner issued a 127-word statement yesterday in which he said he supported Torre , Cashman and the players , while trying to convey his impatience with the ragged start . ''
2007_05_01_1844311	10	Let 's get going , '' concluded the statement , issued through Steinbrenner 's spokesman , Howard Rubenstein . ''
2007_05_01_1844311	11	Let 's go out and win and bring a world championship back to New York .
2007_05_01_1844311	12	That 's what I want . ''
2007_05_01_1844311	13	The Yankees have lost eight of their past nine games , including five of six to the Red Sox , who are 16-8 and six and a half games ahead of the last-place Yankees in the American League East . ''
2007_05_01_1844311	14	I appreciate his support , '' Cashman said . ''
2007_05_01_1844311	15	He 's given us every opportunity to be successful , and he 's going to continue to do that . ''
2007_05_01_1844311	16	Two years ago , after 23 games , the Yankees had the same record and stood the same number of games out of first place .
2007_05_01_1844311	17	They recovered to win the division with a large assist from pitchers Shawn Chacon and Aaron Small , who combined to go 17-3 in the second half .
2007_05_01_1844311	18	Cashman said that he would continue to seek help outside the organization , although trades are rare so early in the season .
2007_05_01_1844311	19	The Yankees must recover soon , because the coming schedule has another batch of showcase games and Steinbrenner made no long-term promises . ''
2007_05_01_1844311	20	He 's saying , ` Go out there and win , ' '' Rubenstein said . ''
2007_05_01_1844311	21	He 's not firing them now .
2007_05_01_1844311	22	He 's really being supportive of them now . ''
2007_05_01_1844311	23	Rubenstein later said not to read into his use of the word '' now , '' saying that Steinbrenner discussed only the crisis of the moment .
2007_05_01_1844311	24	But with the Yankees already five games under .500 , there will be urgency to win every game .
2007_05_01_1844311	25	The Yankees ' next 10 games are against the Rangers and the Mariners , then they face the opponents who matter most to Steinbrenner .
2007_05_01_1844311	26	The Yankees play a three-game series with the Mets at Shea Stadium from May 18 to 20 , then play host to the Red Sox the next three days .
2007_05_01_1844311	27	From June 1 to 3 , the Yankees are at Boston for another series .
2007_05_01_1844311	28	If the Yankees have shown no signs of improvement by then , Steinbrenner may not be so forgiving .
2007_05_01_1844311	29	At such an early point in the season , though , Rubenstein said that Steinbrenner wanted to quell speculation on the fate of Torre , and , to a lesser extent , of Cashman . ''
2007_05_01_1844311	30	The season is still very young , but up to now the results are clearly not acceptable to me or to Yankee fans , '' Steinbrenner 's statement said . ''
2007_05_01_1844311	31	However , Brian Cashman , our general manager ; Joe Torre , our manager ; and our players all believe that they will turn this around quickly . ''
2007_05_01_1844311	32	I believe in them .
2007_05_01_1844311	33	I am here to support them in any way to help them accomplish this turnaround .
2007_05_01_1844311	34	It is time to put excuses and talk away .
2007_05_01_1844311	35	It is time to see if people are ready to step up and accept their responsibilities .
2007_05_01_1844311	36	It is time for all of them to show me and the fans what they are made of . ''
2007_05_01_1844311	37	Rubenstein said that he spoke yesterday morning on a conference call with Steinbrenner and the two top New York-based executives -- Randy Levine , the president , and Lonn Trost , the chief operating officer .
2007_05_01_1844311	38	But he added that the statement was Steinbrenner 's alone .
2007_05_01_1844311	39	Rubenstein said that he did not know if Steinbrenner , 76 , was consulted by his sons , Hank and Hal , who have taken a more active role as general partners this year , with Steve Swindal , another general partner , going through a divorce from Steinbrenner 's daughter Jennifer .
2007_05_01_1844311	40	Several Yankees came out strongly in defense of Torre last weekend , especially the captain , Derek Jeter .
2007_05_01_1844311	41	Rubenstein said that he did not discuss Jeter 's comments with Steinbrenner but that said Steinbrenner seemed to accept the idea that the players deserved blame . ''
2007_05_01_1844311	42	There are a lot of terrific athletes , and now it 's up to all three of them -- the athletes , the manager and the general manager , '' Rubenstein said . ''
2007_05_01_1844311	43	He 's always said that about Torre and Cashman , but now he 's including the ballplayers : ` All three of you , go out and win . '
2007_05_01_1844311	44	He kept saying that over and over to me . ''
2007_05_01_1844311	45	Torre is in the final season of a three-year , $ 19.2 million contract he signed in April 2004 .
2007_05_01_1844311	46	Since then , the Yankees have crumbled to the Red Sox in the American League Championship Series and lost in the division series the next two seasons .
2007_05_01_1844311	47	Yet Torre retains a revered status and is seemingly a lock for the Hall of Fame as a manager .
2007_05_01_1844311	48	Steinbrenner has been leery of the backlash that could come from firing Torre .
2007_05_01_1844311	49	There is also a sense in the organization that it would be unfair to Torre 's most likely successor , Don Mattingly , to replace Torre under these circumstances .
2007_05_01_1844311	50	Mattingly is in his first full season as the bench coach and has never managed .
2007_05_01_1844311	51	The idea of succeeding Torre , though , is off the table for now .
2007_05_01_1844311	52	Steinbrenner made it clear yesterday that he wants this regime to start winning , and to do so immediately . ''
2007_05_01_1844311	53	We 're going to get through this , that 's the bottom line , '' Cashman said . ''
2007_05_01_1844311	54	With our manager and our coaching staff and our players , we 're going to pull through this together . ''
2007_05_01_1844311	55	INSIDE PITCH Center fielder Johnny Damon flew home to Orlando , Fla. , to visit his chiropractor , hoping for improvement in his sore back .
2007_05_01_1844311	56	Brian Cashman said that he was not considering placing Damon on the disabled list .
2007_05_01_1844312	0	Perhaps it was fitting that one of the biggest stories of the N.F.L. draft was the acquisition of a player with a long and colorful history of character issues by a team that usually stays away from them .
2007_05_01_1844312	1	Maybe that player , Randy Moss , will never pretend to moon a bunch of Jets fans .
2007_05_01_1844312	2	But the New England Patriots were willing to take that risk , one day after they also took one with their first-round pick , Brandon Meriweather , who was prominently involved in an on-field brawl last season only months after he fired his gun when defending his roommate during a robbery attempt .
2007_05_01_1844312	3	Player conduct dominated the conversation leading up to last weekend 's draft , as teams grappled with how a crackdown on misbehavior should affect the ordering of their draft boards .
2007_05_01_1844312	4	But those two moves by the Patriots might have best summed up the impact of the emphasis on conduct : Somewhere at the busy intersection of talent , financial risk , misbehavior and team need was where most problem players landed .
2007_05_01_1844312	5	Several players clearly slipped because of previous trouble .
2007_05_01_1844312	6	But others did not slip as far as expected .
2007_05_01_1844312	7	Rod Graves , the Arizona Cardinals ' vice president for football operations , said Sunday that he was surprised to see certain players chosen in the first three rounds Saturday . ''
2007_05_01_1844312	8	We saw a few players go that we would not have taken because of issues we were concerned about , '' Graves said in a telephone interview . ''
2007_05_01_1844312	9	It still gets down to weighing the risk .
2007_05_01_1844312	10	Even though a certain player was taken , the risk factors in as to where they go .
2007_05_01_1844312	11	If you hit under those conditions , it 's different . ''
2007_05_01_1844312	12	That philosophy might have been best illustrated in the case of Marcus Thomas , a defensive tackle so talented that he could have been taken in the top 10 .
2007_05_01_1844312	13	But he was thrown off the University of Florida team for multiple drug-related issues , and he slipped to the fourth round , where he was picked by the Denver Broncos .
2007_05_01_1844312	14	Thomas had been candid in talking about his troubles before the draft , attempting to persuade teams to take a chance on him .
2007_05_01_1844312	15	He said Sunday that he had learned his lesson and that he knew he already had 2.9 strikes against him . ''
2007_05_01_1844312	16	We talked about taking an educated gamble , '' Denver Coach Mike Shanahan said Sunday at a news conference . ''
2007_05_01_1844312	17	Some people do make mistakes , and those players are the luckiest players .
2007_05_01_1844312	18	They come into the N.F.L. without a second chance , and they know if they do make a mistake , then they are gone .
2007_05_01_1844312	19	Sometimes , I think that is better than a guy that has n't been caught and he gets two or three chances .
2007_05_01_1844312	20	We know exactly where the guidelines are drawn . ''
2007_05_01_1844312	21	Shanahan noted a critical dividing line in some minds : Thomas 's troubles were personal , stemming from two failed drug tests , not legal .
2007_05_01_1844312	22	That left teams to divine for themselves how serious they thought a situation was and how indicative of a lifestyle problem it might be .
2007_05_01_1844312	23	Meriweather did not slide , and Coach Bill Belichick was apparently convinced that his transgressions were aberrations .
2007_05_01_1844312	24	Cornerback Eric Wright , who was dismissed from Southern California and transferred to Nevada-Las Vegas after allegations of sexual assault and possession of Ecstasy ( the charges were dropped ) , was a first-round talent , but he slipped to the second round , where Cleveland took him .
2007_05_01_1844312	25	Nate Harris , a Louisville linebacker who served time in a boot camp after being a lookout for an armed robbery in 2002 , might have been a late-round selection if not for his background .
2007_05_01_1844312	26	He went undrafted . ''
2007_05_01_1844312	27	I think it 's always the same formula , '' the former Titans general manager Floyd Reese , who drafted Pacman Jones , said last week . ''
2007_05_01_1844312	28	As soon as you get to a point where either by number or magnitude , you ca n't make it right with yourself or your franchise , then I think he 's eliminated .
2007_05_01_1844312	29	There is a frat fight , a guy grabs your date , and you do something about it .
2007_05_01_1844312	30	In spite of whether you think it 's right or wrong , I can see that happening .
2007_05_01_1844312	31	Versus taking a handgun and going to a 7-Eleven and robbing it . ''
2007_05_01_1844312	32	The impact of the new personal conduct code may be realized only in the next few years , when players selected in the first draft under the new policy are required to behave despite the trappings of wealth and fame .
2007_05_01_1844312	33	Midway through the first round Saturday , Commissioner Roger Goodell said that he thought the new code , which has a provision that would allow him to penalize teams that repeatedly acquire troubled players , had made its point . ''
2007_05_01_1844312	34	I think clubs understand that character is important , '' Goodell said . ''
2007_05_01_1844312	35	But maybe there is greater risk now .
2007_05_01_1844312	36	Almost every club I 've heard from has been very supportive and said it was time to do it . ''
2007_05_01_1844312	37	Moments later , the Buffalo Bills selected running back Marshawn Lynch , who had been accused of sexual assault by a former girlfriend , with the 12th pick .
2007_05_01_1844312	38	Perhaps they were swayed by a package his agents sent to all teams , which included a report from a district attorney and letters from Lynch 's lawyers explaining that a lack of evidence meant that no charges would be brought against him .
2007_05_01_1844312	39	EXTRA POINTS In a letter sent to the league on Saturday , Tennessee Titans cornerback Pacman Jones appealed his season-long suspension for violating the personal-conduct policy .
2007_05_01_1844312	40	The appeal will be heard within 10 days unless both sides agree on a different timetable .
2007_05_01_1844313	0	The little boy and the little girl wore St. Louis Cardinals jerseys and caps , stationed themselves by the third-base dugout and held a tribute sign for Josh Hancock .
2007_05_01_1844313	1	They had drawn a red-and-white uniform with Hancock 's name , his No. 32 and the words '' Will Be Missed . ''
2007_05_01_1844313	2	Several Cardinals spotted the sign as they stumbled to a 7-1 loss to the Milwaukee Brewers , the team 's first game since Hancock , a reliever , was killed in an automobile accident on Sunday in St. Louis .
2007_05_01_1844313	3	Jeff Suppan , who was Hancock 's teammate in St. Louis last season , tossed a complete game for Milwaukee .
2007_05_01_1844313	4	Manager Tony La Russa said that the plane trip Sunday night from St. Louis was subdued and that the bus ride from the airport to the hotel was quiet , too .
2007_05_01_1844313	5	La Russa closed the clubhouse to reporters before the game and held a meeting to discuss Hancock .
2007_05_01_1844313	6	Several of the Cardinals looked drained after the game . ''
2007_05_01_1844313	7	Family and friends , life and death , that 's part of it , '' La Russa said . ''
2007_05_01_1844313	8	Players are not immune .
2007_05_01_1844313	9	We 're not immune .
2007_05_01_1844313	10	You got to honor them and miss them and you got to go on . ''
2007_05_01_1844313	11	The Cardinals honored Hancock by hanging his jersey in the dugout and in the bullpen .
2007_05_01_1844313	12	When the relievers placed Hancock 's jersey in the bullpen , they carefully adjusted the sleeves so that Hancock 's name would not be blocked .
2007_05_01_1844313	13	All of the Cardinals ' uniforms included a black circular patch with the No. 32 on the left sleeves in memory of Hancock , who was 29 .
2007_05_01_1844313	14	Once the Cardinals return home this week , the organization plans to install a memorial sign for Hancock , most likely in the bullpen .
2007_05_01_1844313	15	There is already a DK 57 sign there , which is in honor of Darryl Kile , the Cardinals pitcher who died of a heart blockage in 2002 .
2007_05_01_1844313	16	Five years later , the Cardinals said that enduring the death of one young pitcher did not prepare them for another death of a young pitcher . ''
2007_05_01_1844313	17	I do n't think it 'll help me , '' said the St. Louis pitching coach , Dave Duncan . ''
2007_05_01_1844313	18	Maybe you understand that you will get through it and it will pass in time .
2007_05_01_1844313	19	But it never goes away . ''
2007_05_01_1844313	20	As La Russa described the meeting with his players , he fiddled with a fungo bat .
2007_05_01_1844313	21	He became testy while mentioning how he warned his players to be wary of '' the insincerity of some media people '' who are pursuing '' some kind of story that 's not all sweet . ''
2007_05_01_1844313	22	La Russa did not specify what had upset him . ''
2007_05_01_1844313	23	I 've already seen signs of that , '' La Russa said . ''
2007_05_01_1844313	24	And , if it 's not sincere , I 'm sitting here listening .
2007_05_01_1844313	25	The first time I hear insincerity , I 'm swinging this fungo . ''
2007_05_01_1844313	26	At least one Cardinal was too overcome by dealing with Hancock 's death to play Monday .
2007_05_01_1844313	27	La Russa said he noticed how emotional Scott Spiezio , the right fielder , was during a moment of silence for Hancock and replaced him in the lineup . ''
2007_05_01_1844313	28	Sometimes , you think you 're tough , '' Spiezio said . ''
2007_05_01_1844313	29	All of a sudden , something catches you the wrong way .
2007_05_01_1844313	30	It just hit me at the wrong time . ''
2007_05_01_1844313	31	Hancock died instantly at about 12:30 a.m. Sunday when his Ford Explorer crashed into a tow truck .
2007_05_01_1844313	32	The truck was parked in the far left westbound lane of Highway 40 in St. Louis with its lights blinking , according to Police Chief Joseph Mokwa .
2007_05_01_1844313	33	After Hancock pitched three innings in an 8-1 loss to the Cubs on Saturday , The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported , he had dinner with friends at Mike Shannon 's Steaks and Seafood .
2007_05_01_1844313	34	The restaurant is a few minutes from Busch Stadium .
2007_05_01_1844313	35	Pat Shannon , Shannon 's daughter and the manager of the restaurant , told the newspaper that she '' called the police chief and told him everything I know about '' Saturday night .
2007_05_01_1844313	36	When The Post-Dispatch asked Pat Shannon if Hancock had consumed any alcohol , she declined to comment and said it was a police matter .
2007_05_01_1844313	37	Pat Shannon did not immediately respond to a telephone message .
2007_05_01_1844313	38	Mike Shannon , a longtime Cardinal broadcaster and former St. Louis outfielder and third baseman , would not discuss Hancock or whether he was at the restaurant . ''
2007_05_01_1844313	39	I do n't talk about any of our customers , '' Shannon said .
2007_05_01_1844313	40	Richard Wilkes , a police spokesman , said Hancock 's death was in '' accident reconstruction '' and there would be no updates until that was completed , perhaps by the end of the week .
2007_05_01_1844313	41	An autopsy was performed Monday .
2007_05_01_1844313	42	Hancock , who was 0-1 with a 3.55 earned run average in eight games this season , was part of last year 's World Series championship team .
2007_05_01_1844313	43	La Russa told his players they could honor Hancock 's memory by competing as passionately as he did , even as they miss him . ''
2007_05_01_1844313	44	Yesterday , you felt like you were hit with a sledgehammer , '' reliever Russ Springer said . ''
2007_05_01_1844313	45	Today , you 're still numb .
2007_05_01_1844313	46	It 's going to be tough for a while . ''
2007_05_01_1844315	0	The Security Council endorsed a resolution extending by six months the 10,000-member United Nations mission that helps enforce the 2005 peace accord that ended decades of civil war in southern Sudan .
2007_05_01_1844315	1	The measure expressed '' grave concern '' over the crisis in Darfur , in western Sudan , but to achieve the unanimous backing of the 15-member Council the United States had to drop language putting pressure on Sudan to accept a proposed United Nations-African Union peacekeeping force there .
2007_05_01_1844316	0	Morocco and the Polisario Front , which are struggling for control of resource-rich Western Sahara , agreed to hold direct talks for the first time under the terms of a unanimously passed United Nations Security Council resolution .

2007_05_01_1844318	1	I wondered how such tiny beings were able to visit hundreds of flowers each day and find their way back home .
2007_05_01_1844318	2	The collapsing bee colonies in the United States are today 's canaries in the coal mine .
2007_05_01_1844318	3	It is not surprising that bees which are transported by truck around the country and fed high-fructose corn syrup have compromised immune systems .
2007_05_01_1844318	4	As human beings proliferate , modifying crops in an effort to get an ever higher yield , spraying toxic pesticides and transforming thousands of acres of natural land into suburbs and strip malls , we risk bringing folly upon ourselves and all other species .
2007_05_01_1844318	5	It is time we learn to live in balance with nature rather than attempting to manipulate it to serve only our ends .

2007_05_01_1844319	0	To the Editor : Re '' At Trial , Pain Has a Witness '' ( Findings , April 24 ) : As a chronic pain sufferer , I know finding a doctor willing to treat pain is nearly impossible due to our government 's war on drugs .
2007_05_01_1844319	1	Prescribing pain medications is a balance between aiding patients and leakage of drugs to illegal markets .
2007_05_01_1844319	2	It 's alarming that our government is controlling how doctors treat patients and prescribe medication .
2007_05_01_1844319	3	Had a medical board found Dr. William E. Hurwitz 's practices '' too generous , '' I 'd be willing to accept their finding .
2007_05_01_1844319	4	But it was n't doctors that busted the pain specialists , it was bureaucrats .
2007_05_01_1844319	5	Let 's leave pain treatment and care to the medical community .
2007_05_01_1844319	6	Jesse Alt Baltimore To the Editor : Doctors on the front lines of pain management are often caught between a rock and a hard place .
2007_05_01_1844319	7	On one side there is the real possibility of improper drug diversion and sales , and on the other the potential for failing to alleviate a patient 's suffering .
2007_05_01_1844319	8	A physician can end up a defendant in a criminal trial or a defendant in a civil lawsuit .
2007_05_01_1844319	9	Chronic pain is not like an infection .
2007_05_01_1844319	10	There are n't concrete tests that can prove its existence .
2007_05_01_1844319	11	One must rely on the patient 's description .
2007_05_01_1844319	12	There are inherent risks , but collaborative groups of physicians , pharmacists and nurse practitioners have developed some truly effective ways of preventing drug diversion and setting standards for prescribing them .
2007_05_01_1844320	0	To the Editor : Re '' Treating the Awkward Years '' ( April 24 ) : As a teenager and patient , I was interested to read the recent article on adolescent medicine .
2007_05_01_1844320	1	However , while the article suggested that adolescents need specially trained doctors who can discuss '' teenagers ' issues , '' I find that the problem lies not in what doctors discuss with us but in how they discuss it .
2007_05_01_1844320	2	I do n't expect my doctor to be my therapist , as this article seemed to suggest .
2007_05_01_1844320	3	I simply expect him to meet my eyes when he speaks to me , explain why I must take certain medications or have certain tests done , and to listen my concerns .
2007_05_01_1844320	4	All of this is well within the ability , indeed , the responsibility , of a pediatrician or family practitioner .
2007_05_01_1844321	0	To the Editor : Re '' Understanding Empathy : Can You Feel My Pain ? ''
2007_05_01_1844321	1	( Behavior , April 24 ) : There is a fine line between a practitioner sharing the experiences of the patient and simply having the background to understand those experiences .
2007_05_01_1844321	2	A patient who returns from a trip to an exotic country with unexplained symptoms might seek out a specialist known to have experience in foreign parasites .
2007_05_01_1844321	3	Similarly , an observant Jewish patient seeking psychotherapy after a loss might seek a practitioner familiar with Jewish death and mourning rituals .
2007_05_01_1844321	4	When you are in pain , it helps to be able to start the story with your own experiences without having to explain the background , terminology and social history of those experiences .
2007_05_01_1844321	5	Susan Hornstein Highland Park , N.J.
2007_05_01_1844322	0	On a recent trip to Sydney , Australia , I discovered the true meaning of civilization -- public toilets , lots of them , clean , neat , safe , free of graffiti , working flushes and faucets , and well-stocked with toilet paper , along with paper towels or hand dryers .
2007_05_01_1844322	1	Most are free ( some are automatic pay toilets ) and available 24 hours .
2007_05_01_1844322	2	One free 24-hour toilet under the Darling Harbor Bridge appeared to have just been remodeled with colorful tiles .
2007_05_01_1844322	3	And these facilities are easy to find .
2007_05_01_1844322	4	Street signs point to their locations and indicate if they are accessible to people in wheelchairs or have changing tables for babies .
2007_05_01_1844322	5	In 10 days of walking all over the city , I found not one public toilet that harbored drug users , vagrants , or people seeking sex.Then it was back to reality -- New York City , where the decades-long promise of decent public toilets has thus far proved more fragile than toilet tissue .
2007_05_01_1844322	6	I 've yet to see any of the contracted-for 20 public toilets that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg promised to have open by this year ( installation is scheduled to begin this summer ) .
2007_05_01_1844322	7	And 20 scattered through the five boroughs is hardly sufficient for a city of 8.2 million people that gets 40 million tourists a year .
2007_05_01_1844322	8	In case you 're thinking this is not a health issue , think again .
2007_05_01_1844322	9	The stench of urine on subway platforms , city streets and building alcoves , the occasional deposit of human waste , and the desperation experienced by those in dire need of a safe , clean and open facility add up to a public health problem in my book .
2007_05_01_1844322	10	Need vs. Reality I 'll never forget what I saw years ago from my Times Square office window .
2007_05_01_1844322	11	It was not yet theater time and all the nearby restaurants had signs saying '' Restrooms for customers only . ''
2007_05_01_1844322	12	A well-dressed woman standing near Shubert Alley had an accident in the middle of the sidewalk and collapsed in tears in her companion 's arms .
2007_05_01_1844322	13	No one should have to suffer such humiliation .
2007_05_01_1844322	14	The expression '' When you 've got to go , you 've got to go '' is more often true than not .
2007_05_01_1844322	15	The problem in New York City is more than a century old .
2007_05_01_1844322	16	In 1898 , the Citizens Union , in its first pamphlet , decried the city 's lack of public toilets .
2007_05_01_1844322	17	Now , when the word to the health-wise is to stay well hydrated and millions of people walk around with water bottles , the need for readily accessible toilets is that much greater .
2007_05_01_1844322	18	Near my neighborhood in Brooklyn , the beautiful 585-acre Prospect Park has 10 restrooms , few of them open during nonbusiness hours and several open only sporadically .
2007_05_01_1844322	19	It 's a 10-minute walk to the nearest facility for the hundreds of young children who visit the park 's Third Street playground .
2007_05_01_1844322	20	Small children are notorious for waiting until the last minute , and many of them -- girls as well as boys -- wind up using the ground .
2007_05_01_1844322	21	Adults , too , are often forced to use the great outdoors , like a large stand of bamboo ( now cut down ) that long provided some privacy midpark .
2007_05_01_1844322	22	New York is not alone in its shortage of public toilets .
2007_05_01_1844322	23	London , once a sterling example of a city that took toilets seriously , is busily shutting down many of them and letting others go to ruin .
2007_05_01_1844322	24	City government is not always to blame .
2007_05_01_1844322	25	Community groups sometimes organize opposition to public toilets .
2007_05_01_1844322	26	In 2001 , residents of the Holliswood section of Queens blocked construction of a two-toilet comfort station in a local playground , saying it would fall into disrepair and attract child molesters and vagrants .
2007_05_01_1844322	27	My suggestion some years ago that 24-hour portable toilets be placed strategically around Prospect Park was ignored .
2007_05_01_1844322	28	I was told that they would be chronically vandalized , overturned by rambunctious teenagers .
2007_05_01_1844322	29	Minneapolis circumvented this problem by surrounding its lakeside portable toilets with a brick or concrete structure , but that idea too was ultimately rejected .
2007_05_01_1844322	30	Most of New York 's public toilets are in city parks , and many are in terrible condition and dangerous , hangouts for ne'er - do-wells .
2007_05_01_1844322	31	As for subway toilets , most are permanently closed , apparently to discourage criminal activity .
2007_05_01_1844322	32	Planning Ahead I 've met many women who limit their consumption of liquids , ignore thirst and even risk dehydration for fear that they would have to find a public facility .
2007_05_01_1844322	33	From a health standpoint , this is a highly undesirable solution .
2007_05_01_1844322	34	My own approach , whether traveling by subway , car or on foot , is to be sure to use the toilet just before leaving home , office , restaurant , museum or theater .
2007_05_01_1844322	35	But if you are caught out and about and in need of relief in any American city , here are some suggestions .
2007_05_01_1844322	36	Most hotels and motels have clean , safe , free restrooms in their lobbies , though you may have to tip an attendant .
2007_05_01_1844322	37	Department stores have them as well ( some also have an attendant ) , though usually on an upper floor and in the back of the store .
2007_05_01_1844322	38	Although most restaurants restrict use of their facilities to paying customers , fast-food establishments like McDonald 's and Starbucks exert no control over who uses the toilets .
2007_05_01_1844322	39	If necessary , though , I would n't hesitate to plead with a headwaiter to allow me to use the restroom in a fancier restaurant .
2007_05_01_1844322	40	I once intervened at an upscale restaurant on behalf of a guest conductor for the New York Philharmonic who had prostate problems and simply could n't wait .
2007_05_01_1844322	41	My advice : If you 're desperate , do n't take no for an answer .
2007_05_01_1844322	42	Many museums have bathrooms on the ground level that are accessible before paying an entrance fee .
2007_05_01_1844322	43	And public libraries , when they are open , always have free toilets .
2007_05_01_1844322	44	Hospitals , which are always open , and health clinics also have free , clean bathrooms accessible to the public .
2007_05_01_1844322	45	Chain bookstores like Barnes & Noble and Borders have free public toilets .
2007_05_01_1844322	46	Big businesses like Target and Wal-Mart , warehouse stores , and many suburban supermarkets have accessible toilets .
2007_05_01_1844322	47	Sometimes you may have to ask for a key .
2007_05_01_1844322	48	In Manhattan , the 34th Street Partnership gave up waiting for the city to act and installed two automatic public toilets in Greeley Square and Herald Square .
2007_05_01_1844322	49	Users pay 25 cents for a 20-minute visit .
2007_05_01_1844322	50	As with the public toilets in San Francisco , these are clean and disinfect themselves after each use .
2007_05_01_1844322	51	San Francisco , by the way , has at least 17 of the self-cleaning public toilets that are wheelchair-accessible and have received good ratings from users .
2007_05_01_1844322	52	Admittedly , some of the remaining eight computerized restrooms have proved to be havens for drug users and prostitutes , who figured out how to bypass the 20-minute limit , after which the doors open automatically .
2007_05_01_1844322	53	Some Online Help In researching this topic on the Web , I came across an invaluable site that lists , describes and rates toilet facilities in cities throughout the world .
2007_05_01_1844322	54	Whether you stay close to home or are planning a trip , say , to China , Turkey or South Africa , you may want to check out www.thebathroomdiaries.com and print out the list of public facilities in the cities you plan to visit .
2007_05_01_1844322	55	For example , to find public restrooms in San Francisco , click on USA , which brings up scores of American cities .
2007_05_01_1844322	56	Then click on San Francisco and be amazed .
2007_05_01_1844333	0	New Yorkers who moved to Staten Island to escape congestion and pollution will be disappointed to hear that while air quality deteriorated in all five boroughs over the past year , it is worst in Staten Island , according to the eighth annual air pollution report by the American Lung Association .
2007_05_01_1844333	1	The report , which is scheduled to be released today , found that ozone pollution -- or smog -- is highest on Staten Island .
2007_05_01_1844333	2	And particle pollution , usually known as soot , has become substantially worse there , as well as in Brooklyn and Manhattan .
2007_05_01_1844333	3	Louise A. Vetter , chief executive of the American Lung Association of the City of New York , said that among the factors that contribute to Staten Island 's pollution are the heavy volume of vehicular traffic and diesel exhaust from ferries and barges in New York Harbor .
2007_05_01_1844333	4	Prevailing winds and other meteorological phenomena may also cause pollution from other states to hover over Staten Island , Ms. Vetter said .
2007_05_01_1844334	0	A Brooklyn man who was arrested Sunday on drunken-driving charges near the scene of a hit-and-run accident that killed a 13-year-old boy riding a bicycle was charged yesterday with vehicular manslaughter , the police said .
2007_05_01_1844334	1	They said that the boy , Anthony Delgado of Brooklyn , was struck just after midnight on Sunday at the intersection of Palmetto Street and Central Avenue in Bushwick .
2007_05_01_1844334	2	The man , Melvin Morales , 34 , was arrested a short time later , after being stopped for a reason unconnected to the hit and run , the police said .
2007_05_01_1844334	3	Investigators said that evidence on his sport utility vehicle linked it to the hit and run , and that a surveillance camera had captured images that would provide evidence against Mr. Morales .
2007_05_01_1844335	0	Three men posing as police officers pulled over a vehicle on the New Jersey Turnpike yesterday afternoon , forced the passengers to the ground and stole the car , the state police said .
2007_05_01_1844335	1	The victims , who were not identified , told the police that three men in a white Ford Explorer pulled alongside their southbound Toyota Avalon near the Alexander Hamilton rest area on the turnpike , held up silver badges on chains around their necks , and motioned for the driver to pull over , said Sgt. Jeanne Hengemuhle , a spokeswoman for the state police .
2007_05_01_1844335	2	The men pulled into the rest area , where they were forced out of the car and onto the ground .
2007_05_01_1844335	3	One of the men from the Ford got into the Toyota , which had a New York license plate , DUU-2791 , and both cars sped off , the sergeant said .
2007_05_01_1844336	0	Three New Jersey counties -- Camden , Gloucester and Mercer -- were added yesterday to President Bush 's disaster declaration in regard to the northeaster of April 15 .
2007_05_01_1844336	1	Last week , the president declared disaster areas in Bergen , Burlington , Essex , Passaic , Somerset and Union Counties , with Hudson , Middlesex and Morris added on Saturday .
2007_05_01_1844336	2	Acting Gov. Richard J. Codey had requested that the entire state receive the designation , which gives residents access to federal aid .
2007_05_01_1844336	3	The president also allowed for infrastructure repairs to municipalities in 11 counties .
2007_05_01_1844337	0	Coming off a two-game tour de force , the Nets stars Jason Kidd and Vince Carter are showing why they may be considered among the N.B.A. 's greatest perimeter tandems .
2007_05_01_1844337	1	But they are still without a championship , and their place in history remains to be determined .
2007_05_01_1844337	2	For now , the Nets will gladly leave that debate in the air , so long as they continue to get the panache from Kidd and Carter that vaulted them to consecutive victories against the Toronto Raptors and a 3-1 advantage in their first-round Eastern Conference playoff series .
2007_05_01_1844337	3	The Nets can advance to the conference semifinals with a victory in Toronto tonight .
2007_05_01_1844337	4	If Kidd and Carter continue the dominance they displayed in the previous two games , they could make a strong claim as the best backcourt tandem in these playoffs .
2007_05_01_1844337	5	The Detroit Pistons ' Chauncey Billups and Richard Hamilton already have a championship ring each , and their team is favored to win the Eastern Conference title .
2007_05_01_1844337	6	The Chicago Bulls ' Ben Gordon and Kirk Hinrich are a precocious pair that just helped their team sweep the defending N.B.A. champion Miami Heat .
2007_05_01_1844337	7	The Golden State Warriors ' Baron Davis and Stephen Jackson , playing with a starting lineup of essentially five perimeter players , have helped push the Dallas Mavericks , the Western Conference 's top-seeded team , to the brink of elimination .
2007_05_01_1844337	8	But even these perimeter pairings would have a difficult time matching what Kidd and Carter did in Games 3 and 4 .
2007_05_01_1844337	9	Kidd averaged 16.5 points , 16 assists and 12 rebounds in the two games and shot 54.2 percent from the field .
2007_05_01_1844337	10	In Game 3 , Kidd became the third player in postseason history to record at least 15 points , 15 rebounds and 15 assists in a game .
2007_05_01_1844337	11	Carter averaged 32 points and shot 61.2 percent in the two games .
2007_05_01_1844337	12	Both players could have had triple-doubles in Game 4 , but Kidd sat out the fourth quarter and Carter sat out the game 's final 10 minutes . ''
2007_05_01_1844337	13	I think the thing that 's unique about Jason and Vince is that they compete for each other , '' Nets Coach Lawrence Frank said . ''
2007_05_01_1844337	14	Sometimes , you have situations where you have two high-level All-Stars , they compete against each other .
2007_05_01_1844337	15	These guys totally relish in making sure the other one plays well . ''
2007_05_01_1844337	16	Kidd seems to have an innate ability to get Carter going .
2007_05_01_1844337	17	When the Nets returned to New Jersey for Game 3 on Friday night , Carter was coming off disappointing performances in the first two games , when he averaged 17.5 points and shot 30.2 percent .
2007_05_01_1844337	18	But Carter was on point from the start of Game 3 , and Kidd assisted him on 10 of his first 11 field goals .
2007_05_01_1844337	19	In Game 4 , Kidd got Carter going with assists on 4 of his first 7 field goals .
2007_05_01_1844337	20	Carter returned the favor by assisting Kidd on 4 of his 6 field goals in Game 4 . ''
2007_05_01_1844337	21	We 're trying to just make plays for ourselves , but also each other , '' Carter said . ''
2007_05_01_1844337	22	We feed off each other , we work well off each other . ''
2007_05_01_1844337	23	Kidd , perhaps getting in touch with his inner perfectionist , has not been quick to crown himself or Carter .
2007_05_01_1844337	24	After his excellent Game 3 , Kidd asked , '' What have I accomplished ? ''
2007_05_01_1844337	25	After Game 4 , he suggested Carter could find yet another gear . ''
2007_05_01_1844337	26	Vince is playing some of his best basketball , '' Kidd said . ''
2007_05_01_1844337	27	I would n't say it 's his best because , as teammates and professionals , we always want him to give us more .
2007_05_01_1844337	28	For him , he ca n't settle . ''
2007_05_01_1844337	29	Kidd knows that in order for he and Carter to truly excel , they must do so in a hostile environment .
2007_05_01_1844337	30	Carter , a former Raptors star , has been especially subpar in front of his former home fans .
2007_05_01_1844337	31	In addition to his struggles in Toronto in Games 1 and 2 , Carter averaged only 14.5 points and shot 28.1 percent in two regular-season games there .
2007_05_01_1844337	32	Kidd , despite averaging a triple-double in this series ( 13.8 points , 13.5 assists and 11.3 rebounds ) , struggled to make shots in the opening games .
2007_05_01_1844337	33	With the Raptors ' season on the line tonight , there is little doubt that the Nets will be tested by the Toronto players and their raucous fans . ''
2007_05_01_1844337	34	The hardest part about the playoffs , '' Kidd said , '' is being able to end a series . ''
2007_05_01_1844337	35	SPURS 96 , NUGGETS 89 -- Tim Duncan scored 22 points as visiting San Antonio took a 3-1 lead in the Western Conference series with its third straight victory .

2007_05_01_1844337	37	( AP ) CAVALIERS 97 , WIZARDS 90 -- Cleveland completed a playoff sweep for the first time in franchise history , defeating host Washington with yet another unconvincing performance .
2007_05_01_1844337	38	LeBron James labored through an 8-for-22 shooting effort , but he made 14 of 17 free throws to finish with 31 points for the Cavaliers .
2007_05_01_1844337	39	( AP ) ROCKETS 96 , JAZZ 92 -- Tracy McGrady had 26 points and a career-high 16 assists as Houston defeated visiting Utah to take a 3-2 lead in their first-round series .

2007_05_01_1844337	41	Yao also grabbed 15 rebounds .

2007_05_15_1847451	0	Scientists have known for years that when fishing trawlers drag nets and gear across the ocean bottom they trap or kill almost all the fish , mollusks and other creatures they encounter .
2007_05_15_1847451	1	And the dragging destroys underwater features like reefs , turning the bottom to mud .
2007_05_15_1847451	2	Now , scientists have used satellite images to show fleets of trawlers leaving plumes of mud behind them like contrails .
2007_05_15_1847451	3	They hope the images will focus wider attention on trawling damage , and on the possible uses of satellites to monitor fishing .
2007_05_15_1847451	4	One of the researchers , Kyle Van Houtan , who earned his doctorate in environmental science in December at Duke , began the work when he was studying the nesting success of sea turtles and wanted to check the influence of shrimpers , who trawl the bottom for their catch .
2007_05_15_1847451	5	He turned for guidance to Daniel Pauly , director of the fisheries center at the University of British Columbia , which maintains an elaborate global database on fishing .
2007_05_15_1847451	6	Looking at satellite photos of boats at work , '' I kept seeing lines on the images , '' Dr. Van Houtan said in a telephone interview . ''
2007_05_15_1847451	7	My first thought was they looked like contrails from aircraft . ''
2007_05_15_1847451	8	Instead , he and Dr. Pauly dubbed them '' mudtrails . ''
2007_05_15_1847451	9	Churning up mud does immense harm , Dr. Pauly said in a telephone interview .
2007_05_15_1847451	10	Fish can not see in water that is murky with suspended sediment .
2007_05_15_1847451	11	The mud can also clog their gills and set off algae blooms , which , in turn , lead to vast increases in bacteria .
2007_05_15_1847451	12	Ultimately , the result is a dead zone .
2007_05_15_1847451	13	Even if that worst case does not materialize , trawling can change a vibrant ocean bottom into , in effect , a shrimp farm .
2007_05_15_1847451	14	The mud of repeatedly trawled areas is congenial to shrimp , Dr. Van Houtan said , '' but anything else you might like to eat , like tuna , is gone . '' ''
2007_05_15_1847451	15	It was one of those eureka moments , '' he said of his realization that mudtrails were visible from space .
2007_05_15_1847451	16	When he looked at images of prime fishing areas , '' we saw an amazing density of boats , '' he said . ''
2007_05_15_1847451	17	You can see the birds following the boats to get the discarded bycatch . ''
2007_05_15_1847451	18	The good news , Dr. Pauly said , is that trawlers and their mudtrails can be seen so clearly that it would in theory be possible to monitor fishing by satellite .
2007_05_15_1847451	19	Even if captains of individual boats do not want to cooperate in such efforts , Dr. Pauly said , '' we can see what they do . ''
2007_05_15_1847452	0	How a Vast Ice Sheet Put the Squeeze On Earth ( and Its Gravity ) To use a very unscientific term , the earth is squishable .
2007_05_15_1847452	1	Put a heavy weight on it and the crust will deform .
2007_05_15_1847452	2	Remove the weight and the crust will rebound .
2007_05_15_1847452	3	During the last ice age , the Laurentide ice sheet was extremely heavy .
2007_05_15_1847452	4	About two miles thick and extending over what is now Canada and part of the United States , it caused the crust to deform , essentially squishing it out to the sides .
2007_05_15_1847452	5	That left less mass underneath it , and less mass means less gravity .
2007_05_15_1847452	6	Since the sheet retreated , the crust has been rebounding , which means gravity has been slowly increasing .
2007_05_15_1847452	7	At least that 's what scientists have assumed to explain anomalous gravitational readings in part of Canada .
2007_05_15_1847452	8	But there could be other explanations as well , particularly tectonic processes driven by mantle convection , the flow of heat from within the earth .
2007_05_15_1847452	9	A study led by Mark Tamisiea of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics has helped sort out the puzzle .
2007_05_15_1847452	10	Using data from satellites that can measure gravitational changes over time , the researchers isolated the relatively short-term rebound effect from the longer-term mantle convection effect .
2007_05_15_1847452	11	They conclude in the journal Science that the rebound effect contributes about 25 to 45 percent to the changing gravitational signal .
2007_05_15_1847452	12	The data also sheds light on the structure of the ice sheet , which was n't uniformly thick .
2007_05_15_1847452	13	Dr. Tamisiea said his work showed that the sheet had two domes , to the east and west of Hudson Bay , where the weight was greatest , and thus so was the deformation and gravitational effect .
2007_05_15_1847452	14	A Superabsorbent Polymer That Puts Paper Towels To Shame If you 've ever changed a disposable diaper , you 're familiar with superabsorbent gels .
2007_05_15_1847452	15	These are ionic polymers that are powdery when dry but can soak up large amounts of liquid .
2007_05_15_1847452	16	But these gels can absorb only water-based liquids .
2007_05_15_1847452	17	So while they are great in diapers ( and in countless other products ) , they are useless , for example , in soaking up many hydrocarbons or other volatile organic compounds .
2007_05_15_1847452	18	Now Kazuki Sada and colleagues at Kyushu University in Japan have come up with an oil-loving gel that can absorb up to 500 times its volume in organic solvents like tetrahydrofuran and chlorobenzene .
2007_05_15_1847452	19	The research is reported in Nature Materials .
2007_05_15_1847452	20	Dr. Sada notes that conventional gels contain carboxylate or sodium ions , which attract water molecules ( which have polarity , a slight positive charge near the hydrogen and a slight negative charge near the oxygen ) .
2007_05_15_1847452	21	But oils and many other organic compounds have weak or no polarity and cause such gels to collapse .
2007_05_15_1847452	22	His group 's breakthrough , Dr. Sada wrote in an e-mail message , was to build a polymer with ionic groups like alkyls or phenyls that are also oil-loving .
2007_05_15_1847452	23	The researchers say that by varying the polymer chemistry and incorporating different ionic groups , gels could be tailored to specific organic compounds and could be used in cleaning up after leaks or spills of oil or other potentially hazardous materials .
2007_05_15_1847452	24	Wild Wheat Seeds , Spreading and Narrowing To Make Their Move There are plenty of ways for seeds to get around .
2007_05_15_1847452	25	Some are transported by wind or water .
2007_05_15_1847452	26	Some are picked up by animals .
2007_05_15_1847452	27	And some have a way of dispersing themselves by forceful ejection from a capsule that pops open .
2007_05_15_1847452	28	Rivka Elbaum , a researcher formerly with the Max Planck Institute for Colloids and Interfaces in Golm , Germany , has discovered that wild wheat seeds apparently use a different form of self-propulsion .
2007_05_15_1847452	29	She and colleagues report in the journal Science that these seeds have awns , bristlelike appendages that can propel them across or into the ground .
2007_05_15_1847452	30	Dr. Elbaum , a material chemist , first became interested in the seeds while doing work with archaeologists .
2007_05_15_1847452	31	In the current study , she examined the awns , which come out of the top of the seed in a V shape , using electron and acoustic microscopy .
2007_05_15_1847452	32	In cross section , the awns have a cap on the inside edge and a ridge on the outside edge .
2007_05_15_1847452	33	The cap is much stiffer , yet both sides are made of the same material -- cellulose .
2007_05_15_1847452	34	The cellulose strands are aligned on the cap side and jumbled together on the ridge side .
2007_05_15_1847452	35	This difference in orientation , Dr. Elbaum found , results in a different response when the awn is exposed to humid air .
2007_05_15_1847452	36	The cap side only swells laterally .
2007_05_15_1847452	37	But the ridge side swells in all directions , effectively elongating that side and bending the awn .
2007_05_15_1847452	38	The result is that in more humid air , as found at night , the awns move toward one another .
2007_05_15_1847452	39	When the air dries out during the day , the awns spread apart again .
2007_05_15_1847452	40	In lab tests , Dr. Elbaum found that this alternating spreading-narrowing movement could propel the seed an inch or more -- which in the field might be far enough for it to reach a better spot in the soil .
2007_05_15_1847452	41	Tiny upward-facing hairs on the lower portion of the awns have a ratchetlike function , preventing the awns from backsliding once they 've moved .
2007_05_15_1847452	42	The awns can also drive a seed straight into the soil , Dr. Elbaum found . ''
2007_05_15_1847452	43	It 's built like an arrow , shooting into the ground , '' she said . ''
2007_05_15_1847452	44	From an evolutionary point of view , things are really optimized to do their job , '' she added .
2007_05_15_1847452	45	But humans got involved with wheat evolution , domesticating it thousands of years ago .
2007_05_15_1847452	46	Some domesticated varieties have the same awn structure , but since they have been bred so that the seeds stay on the plant , the awns no longer serve as a motor .
2007_05_15_1847454	0	Samantha Carolan was 23 and fresh out of graduate school when she decided to donate eggs to an infertile couple .
2007_05_15_1847454	1	Ms. Carolan concedes that she would never have done it if not for the money , $ 7,000 that she used to pay off some student loans .
2007_05_15_1847454	2	She has since had a second egg extraction , for which she was paid $ 8,000 , and she is planning a third before taking a break . ''
2007_05_15_1847454	3	The first time , it 's frightening , '' said Ms. Carolan , now 24 , of Winfield Park , N.J. '' It is surgery , and I do n't think I would have done it without compensation .
2007_05_15_1847454	4	But I had very limited pain , and it was a great experience for me .
2007_05_15_1847454	5	I would have done it the second time for less money or even no compensation . ''
2007_05_15_1847454	6	Though many egg donors derive great satisfaction from knowing that they helped someone start a family , the price of eggs has soared in recent years as demand has increased , and the sizable payments raise controversy .
2007_05_15_1847454	7	A survey published this month in the journal Fertility and Sterility , '' What Is Happening to the Price of Eggs ? ''
2007_05_15_1847454	8	found that the national average compensation for donors was $ 4,217 .
2007_05_15_1847454	9	At least one center told the authors of the paper that it paid $ 15,000 .
2007_05_15_1847454	10	Many centers did not respond .
2007_05_15_1847454	11	Though laws prohibit the sale of transplant organs , sperm donors have always received small payments , and prospective parents in the United States are allowed to compensate women for their far greater expenditure of time and energy .
2007_05_15_1847454	12	( Many countries , including Canada and Britain , do prohibit payments to egg donors . )
2007_05_15_1847454	13	The American Society for Reproductive Medicine considers compensation of $ 5,000 or more to '' require justification '' and sums exceeding $ 10,000 '' beyond what is appropriate . ''
2007_05_15_1847454	14	Meanwhile , advertisements recruiting students from elite universities to donate promise tens of thousands of dollars , and donor agencies have sprung up , appealing to would-be parents with online videos and photo galleries of donors .
2007_05_15_1847454	15	According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , 5,767 babies were born in 2003 from donor eggs ; the number of actual egg donations is probably much higher , however , because the success rate is fairly low .
2007_05_15_1847454	16	Ethicists and some women 's health advocates worry that lucrative payments are enticing young women with credit-card debt and steep tuition bills to sell eggs without seriously evaluating the risks . ''
2007_05_15_1847454	17	The real issue is whether the money can cloud someone 's judgment , '' said Josephine Johnston , an associate for law and bioethics at the Hastings Center , a research group in Garrison , N.Y. , that specializes in medical ethics .
2007_05_15_1847454	18	She does not oppose compensation , but she does worry about high prices . ''
2007_05_15_1847454	19	We hear about egg donors being paid enormous amounts of money , $ 50,000 or $ 60,000 , '' Ms. Johnston said . ''
2007_05_15_1847454	20	How much is that person actually giving informed consent about the medical procedure and really listening and thinking as it 's being described and its risks are explained ? ''
2007_05_15_1847454	21	Adding to the debate was a proposal by lawmakers in Maryland to ban payments for eggs .
2007_05_15_1847454	22	Proponents of compensation say if payments are lowered or eliminated , the supply of eggs will dwindle or dry up . ''
2007_05_15_1847454	23	Women are n't exactly lining up to be donors , '' said Dr. Mark Sauer , director of the Center for Women 's Reproductive Care at the Columbia University Medical Center . ''
2007_05_15_1847454	24	There are a lot more recipients than donors . ''
2007_05_15_1847454	25	Part of the problem is that the risks of donation have not been thoroughly studied .
2007_05_15_1847454	26	Although the consensus among most reproductive endocrinologists is that extraction is safe , five deaths have been reported in Britain .
2007_05_15_1847454	27	There are enough unanswered questions that stem cell researchers have promised not to pay for eggs . ''
2007_05_15_1847454	28	One of the most striking facts about in vitro fertilization is just how little is known with certainty about the long-term health outcomes for the women who undergo the procedure , '' a recent report by the Institute of Medicine said .
2007_05_15_1847454	29	The 2005 guidelines of the National Academy of Sciences for human embryonic stem cell research discourage paying for eggs for research .
2007_05_15_1847454	30	The California Institute for Regenerative Medicine reimburses women only for out-of-pocket expenses like lost wages or cab fare . ''
2007_05_15_1847454	31	As a public agency , we felt we should n't be putting money on the table that might induce someone to take a risk , '' said Geoffrey Lomax , senior officer for medical and ethical standards at the institute .
2007_05_15_1847454	32	So far , women have not come forward to give away eggs for research . ''
2007_05_15_1847454	33	I just completed an outreach initiative to 21 institutions across the state that we 've funded , '' Dr. Lomax said . ''
2007_05_15_1847454	34	No one has had an egg donated specifically for research . ''
2007_05_15_1847454	35	The reluctance is understandable .
2007_05_15_1847454	36	The process of egg extraction is time consuming , and it is not comfortable .
2007_05_15_1847454	37	For some women , it can be painful .
2007_05_15_1847454	38	A woman first has to take medications to stop her menstrual cycle and then daily hormone injections for several weeks to stimulate her ovaries to produce a crop of mature eggs at once .
2007_05_15_1847454	39	The drugs may cause bloating , weight gain , moodiness and irritability , and there is a risk of a rare condition called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome that can cause life-threatening complications , blood clots and kidney failure .
2007_05_15_1847454	40	The egg extraction itself is a surgical procedure in which a thin needle is inserted through the vagina into the ovary to retrieve the eggs and liquid from the follicles .
2007_05_15_1847454	41	Risks include adverse responses to anesthesia , infection , bleeding or the inadvertent puncture of an organ .
2007_05_15_1847454	42	It is the long-term risks , both physical and psychological , that are harder to assess .
2007_05_15_1847454	43	Questions have been raised about whether extraction may jeopardize the donor 's fertility , and critics worry about the potential psychological harm to a donor of eggs as a young woman who later finds that she is unable to have children .
2007_05_15_1847454	44	And since egg donors go through much the same process as women trying to conceive in vitro , there are concerns that they may be prone to the higher rates of certain cancers that some studies have found among infertility patients .
2007_05_15_1847454	45	Still , said Dr. James A. Grifo , director of the division of reproductive endocrinology at the New York University School of Medicine , '' There is no credible evidence of long-lasting effects or health consequences down the line . ''
2007_05_15_1847454	46	That does not necessarily mean that the procedures are safe . ''
2007_05_15_1847454	47	There 's no health-outcome data collected by anybody other than some voluntary reporting , and there 's no postmarket testing on how these drugs are being used , '' said Susan Berke Fogel , co-founder of the Pro-Choice Alliance for Responsible Research , a project of the Public Health Institute in Oakland , Calif. .
2007_05_15_1847454	48	In a recent article in The New England Journal of Medicine , a Harvard Business School professor said the controversy over the price of eggs was obscuring questions of women 's health .
2007_05_15_1847454	49	The author , Debora L. Spar , an economist who wrote '' The Baby Business '' last year , calls for more studies of the drugs being used , more long-term follow-up of donors and federal regulations to ensure proper informed consent .
2007_05_15_1847454	50	When Ms. Carolan went to donate , the short-term risks were described to her in detail , but she said she did not recall any mention of possible long-term risks .
2007_05_15_1847454	51	Her family opposed her decision because they worried about her health , she said , and her friends did not understand . ''
2007_05_15_1847454	52	They all think I 'm crazy , '' she said . ''
2007_05_15_1847454	53	If the topic comes up , and I tell friends I 've done it , they 're like : ` Why ?
2007_05_15_1847454	54	Oh my God , are n't you afraid you have a baby out there ? '
2007_05_15_1847454	55	They 're so stunned and shocked . ''
2007_05_15_1847454	56	Then she tells them how much she was paid . ''
2007_05_15_1847454	57	And then they go , ` O.K. , I understand now , that 's cool , ' '' she said . ''
2007_05_15_1847454	58	People understand the money . ''
2007_05_15_1847455	0	THE CLAIM Darker skin protects against skin cancer .
2007_05_15_1847455	1	THE FACTS It is well known that people with darker skin get deeper tans and burn less quickly than other people .
2007_05_15_1847455	2	But does that mean better protection against skin cancer ?
2007_05_15_1847455	3	The answer is not clear-cut .
2007_05_15_1847455	4	Although darker-skinned people face a lower risk of skin cancer , they are more likely to develop more aggressive forms of the disease and more likely to die from it .
2007_05_15_1847455	5	A large part of the problem is a false sense of security .
2007_05_15_1847455	6	Dark skin has higher amounts of melanin that can filter as much as twice the amount of ultraviolet radiation as paler skin .
2007_05_15_1847455	7	But that protection still falls short of what doctors recommend when using sunscreen : a skin protection factor , or SPF , of 15 or more .
2007_05_15_1847455	8	And because many people with dark skin believe that it provides complete immunity , experts say , they often overlook early warning signs .
2007_05_15_1847455	9	A 2006 study in The Archives of Internal Medicine looked at more than 1,500 people with melanoma .
2007_05_15_1847455	10	It found that whites were far less likely to have late-stage melanoma than blacks , Hispanics , American Indians and Asians .
2007_05_15_1847455	11	On average , whites also had a greater five-year survival rate ( 90 percent ) than the others ( less than 80 percent ) .
2007_05_15_1847455	12	Another study last year in The Archives of Dermatology looked at 1,700 cases of melanoma reported in Florida over a five-year period and had similar results .
2007_05_15_1847455	13	THE BOTTOM LINE People with darker skin tones have a lower risk of skin cancer , but are more likely to die from it .
2007_05_15_1847456	0	Deborah Lohse 's '' Lucy Poems '' is an example of a phenomenon that crops up every now and again : someone has the worthy thought that he or she will make ballet look contemporary .
2007_05_15_1847456	1	The most successful practitioner of this genre is Karole Armitage , whose '' Drastic Classicism '' -- frenzied ballet to an ear-splitting rock score -- shocked and thrilled audiences in 1981 .
2007_05_15_1847456	2	( Twyla Tharp and William Forsythe had used rock music for ballet companies well before that , but their subject was not primarily how classical dance inhabits the modern world . )
2007_05_15_1847456	3	But Ms. Armitage 's rabbit can appear from the same hat only once : now it takes more than the juxtaposition of point shoes , unconventional gestures , aggression and uncomfortable levels of noise to shock audiences into seeing ballet anew .
2007_05_15_1847456	4	What it takes ( and it has been done , post-Balanchine ) is using the classical vocabulary to expand our notions of what ballet , as an art form , can physically encompass .
2007_05_15_1847456	5	This is not what happens onstage in '' The Lucy Poems , '' performed at the Clark Studio Theater at Lincoln Center on Friday night by Ms. Lohse 's new ensemble , called ad hoc Ballet .
2007_05_15_1847456	6	Instead , a trio of women ( Amy Brandt , Elizabeth Brown and Candice Thompson ) , on point and wearing ragged corsets over gray leotards , spend close to an hour performing fairly conventional ballet steps overlaid with gestures ( wiggling fingers , hands to head ) and actions ( hands slapping legs or pushing a limb away ) that imitate the style of choreographers like Mr. Forsythe or Jorma Elo without the generating principles that inform their dance .
2007_05_15_1847456	7	The women 's duos , trios and solos are danced to a variety of contemporary scores , from vaguely minimalist and rhythmic to the kind of piano doodling that makes you want to send the perpetrator outside for some fresh air .
2007_05_15_1847456	8	( It might seem less annoying if it did n't so exactly mirror the effect of the dancing . )
2007_05_15_1847456	9	These sections are juxtaposed against brief segments , set to harsh electronic music , for Ms. Lohse , who convincingly evokes a disturbing world of mental illness as she jerkily rocks her body and contorts her arms .
2007_05_15_1847456	10	Late in the work Ms. Lohse performs a longer solo , and its powerful atmosphere and images of madness come as a shock after the preceding choreographic meanderings .
2007_05_15_1847456	11	It 's a sole moment of clarity in '' The Lucy Poems , '' and it suggests that Ms. Lohse is capable of more .
2007_05_15_1847458	0	The Pesthouse By Jim Crace 255 pages .
2007_05_15_1847458	1	An unspecified war or series of wars has dragged the world back into a harsh , preindustrial existence .
2007_05_15_1847458	2	In what was the United States , its cities gone and its population vastly reduced , the survivors live meagerly off the land , using the most rudimentary of tools .
2007_05_15_1847458	3	A crude social structure has sprung up in isolated local communities ; bandits maraud through stretches of countryside ; and life has been reduced to the Hobbesian state : nasty , brutish and short .
2007_05_15_1847458	4	It is the setting for '' The Pesthouse , '' which , unlikely as it may seem , is a romance .
2007_05_15_1847458	5	At least , that is as close as definition can get to the undefinable art of Jim Crace .
2007_05_15_1847458	6	The least known among the crowning trio of living British writers , along with Barry Unsworth and Ian McEwen , he lodges his finest work in extremity .
2007_05_15_1847458	7	Here it is a futurist nightmare ; in '' The Gift of Stones '' it was the twilight of a Stone Age community ; in '' Quarantine , '' possibly his masterpiece , it was Jesus spending 40 irritatingly hysterical days among a collection of desert dwellers .
2007_05_15_1847458	8	In '' Being Dead , '' it was the beachside decay of the bodies of two murder victims .
2007_05_15_1847458	9	This last description impales itself on its own thumbnail , of course .
2007_05_15_1847458	10	Who could read it without suspecting parody or pretention ?
2007_05_15_1847458	11	Who could guess that Mr. Crace is so witty , graceful and haunting ?
2007_05_15_1847458	12	He brings his large , distant abstractions -- prehistory , a dystopic future , religion , death -- up close , segmenting them into tangible and particular fictional parcels .
2007_05_15_1847458	13	His universal themes are paced out in wry individual footsteps .
2007_05_15_1847458	14	Everyone and everything have their voices .
2007_05_15_1847458	15	In '' The Pesthouse '' it is not just a man and a woman , waifs who grow into mastery as they make a pilgrimage through blighted landscape .
2007_05_15_1847458	16	It is also the rain deciding to let up , their horse considering the lake he is to ford , an insomniac 's ill-digested dinner '' foraging with its nocturnal snout . ''
2007_05_15_1847458	17	( In '' Being Dead , '' even the bodies have points of view ; so do the gulls tearing at them , and the crabs laboring corpseward '' through their exaggerated countryside . ''
2007_05_15_1847458	18	This phrase transforms their crooked gait from our take on crabs to the crabs ' take on the world . )
2007_05_15_1847458	19	The journey in '' The Pesthouse '' is quite different from that in Cormac McCarthy 's recent book , '' The Road , '' though both run through postapocalyptic landscapes .
2007_05_15_1847458	20	Mr. McCarthy 's father and son themselves are at a postapocalyptic end , though they keep walking .
2007_05_15_1847458	21	Mr. Crace 's Franklin and Margaret , outcast innocents traveling counter to the tides of their brutal world , will find the beginnings of redemption .
2007_05_15_1847458	22	A cruel myth has set throngs of emigrants fleeing from their weary inland lives toward the Atlantic coast .
2007_05_15_1847458	23	( Mr. Crace has little use for America 's westward dream ; his irony unspools it eastward . )
2007_05_15_1847458	24	There , it is said , sailing ships will transport them to lavish prosperity across the ocean , where land is plentiful and fertile , and disease so unknown that '' people would travel for a day just to watch a man sniff . ''
2007_05_15_1847458	25	Franklin , lame and hesitant , was left behind on a high bluff overlooking Ferrytown , the last big river crossing on the way east .
2007_05_15_1847458	26	There he meets Margaret , stricken by a plaguelike disease and deposited by her family in a hut -- the pesthouse of the title -- to heal or die .
2007_05_15_1847458	27	Instead of shunning her , Francis cares for her , and care slowly evolves into a mutual ardor that will be played out only after their journey , and the book , ends .
2007_05_15_1847458	28	Tumescence , finely suggested in the author 's stately , faintly archaic prose , pulses this strange story and stops the heart as no consummation would .
2007_05_15_1847458	29	By the time Francis and a slowly recovering Margaret are able to climb down to Ferrytown , it is a place of the dead .
2007_05_15_1847458	30	A landslide has churned up the bottom of the lake , releasing its lethal gases .
2007_05_15_1847458	31	Something similar happened in Africa a few years ago , but for Mr. Crace there are no safely remote horrors .
2007_05_15_1847458	32	The couple get across the river ; their trek east is a series of ordeals through a blasted America , the worst of which is Francis 's temporary abduction by a savagely jocular bandit gang .
2007_05_15_1847458	33	Mr. Crace writes of these things with an oddly lyrical lightness , the kind of lightness that made Seamus Heaney 's rendering of '' Beowulf '' move in a way that eases as it grips .
2007_05_15_1847458	34	Some of the episodes that follow -- Margaret takes refuge in the stronghold of a creepy penitential sect ; the bandits raid it ; Francis breaks free ; he and Margaret ride off on the bandits ' horses -- froth up the novel 's limpid current .
2007_05_15_1847458	35	Only for a while .
2007_05_15_1847458	36	The sailing ships that so many have tried to reach turn out to be slave vessels .
2007_05_15_1847458	37	The ocean itself , when they glimpse it , signals not promise but rejection . ''
2007_05_15_1847458	38	Margaret could not have guessed how leaden it would be , and lacking in expression . ''
2007_05_15_1847458	39	And they turn back , heading to what they know .
2007_05_15_1847458	40	The west , that is ( in Mr. Crace 's sardonic reversal ) , with hardships that nevertheless stand for life , as against the easy poison of eastward delusion .
2007_05_15_1847458	41	The return is as poetically detailed as the way out , but a doom has been lifted from it . ''
2007_05_15_1847458	42	They no longer felt defeated by America , as most emigrants had on the journey out , driven eastward by their failings , '' the author writes . ''
2007_05_15_1847458	43	It was as if the country that had once been hostile to them was regretful for it and was now providing recompense -- fewer dangers , warmer nights , softer going . ''
2007_05_15_1847458	44	The book ends in a pastoral lighting that could be sentimental , except that the travelers have been put through so many aching horrors that they -- and we -- have earned the right to hope .
2007_05_15_1847458	45	Mr. Crace is the coldest of writers , and the tenderest .
2007_05_15_1847458	46	BOOKS OF THE TIMES Correction : May 16 , 2007 , Wednesday The Books of The Times review yesterday , about '' The Pesthouse , '' by Jim Crace , misstated the name of one character at several points .
2007_05_15_1847458	47	As noted elsewhere in the review , he is Franklin , not Francis .
2007_05_15_1847458	48	The review also misspelled the surname of a writer who was described in the review as part of '' the crowning trio of living British writers , '' along with Mr. Crace and Barry Unsworth .
2007_05_15_1847458	49	He is Ian McEwan , not McEwen .
2007_05_15_1847460	0	I never much cared for royalty , although I admit that , for reasons my family and I are still struggling to understand , I named my first cat '' Princess Bubbles . ''
2007_05_15_1847460	1	Nevertheless , as I watched Queen Elizabeth II float serenely last week through her swooning colonial multitudes , here chatting with Goddard engineers on the wonders of the space age , there catching the president on blunders about the queen 's age , I could n't help but doff a small mental tiara to the great lady .
2007_05_15_1847460	2	Such sober poise and unpompous stances !
2007_05_15_1847460	3	She 's majestic , all right , her regalness clearly born , made and thrust upon her every day of her life .
2007_05_15_1847460	4	In so many ways , Elizabeth reminded me of another monarch I admire : the honeybee queen , that stoical , beloved mother to the worker masses in a beehive .
2007_05_15_1847460	5	Sure , Her Highness may go in for pastel solids and Her Hymenoptera for fuzzy stripes , but both are tiny , attractive celebrities prone to being swarmed .
2007_05_15_1847460	6	Both are kept meticulously well-groomed by a retinue of handlers and are fed high-quality foods generally unavailable to the proletariat .
2007_05_15_1847460	7	Both are , yes , long-lived .
2007_05_15_1847460	8	And both share the dubious honor of having enormous social responsibility but very little power . ''
2007_05_15_1847460	9	The queen bee , like the queen of England , is not the ruler , and she does n't tell anybody what to do , '' said Gene E. Robinson , a professor of integrative biology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign . ''
2007_05_15_1847460	10	But she makes things work , and she makes everything better by being around . ''
2007_05_15_1847460	11	Dr. Robinson and other researchers are trying to understand the deep nature of the honeybee : why it behaves as it does , how a young bee knows it 's time to grow up and get out of the house , how an older bee finds its way back to the house after a hard day 's work , and what distinguishes a queen bee from the tens of thousands of worker bees that surround her .
2007_05_15_1847460	12	The researchers are driven by more than a perfectly understandable besottedness with bees .
2007_05_15_1847460	13	They see bees , with their comma-sized brains , compact genomes and circumscribed set of stereotyped behaviors , as offering a relatively simple and politically unobjectionable system for deciphering the biology of behavior .
2007_05_15_1847460	14	To that end , they are mapping out the chemical sequence of honeybee DNA and recently published a rough draft of the bee 's 11,000 or so genes .
2007_05_15_1847460	15	Researchers are also scrambling for clues , any clues , into the recent , baffling disappearance of honeybees across the United States , a potentially catastrophic trend that threatens the hundred or more food crops dependent on bees for pollination .
2007_05_15_1847460	16	Unlike the great bee die-offs of the past , when mites or other deadly pathogens left mounds of bee corpses lying by the hives , in the newest crisis there are as yet no bee bodies to forensically explore .
2007_05_15_1847460	17	The bees are simply flying off by the billions as though into the void .
2007_05_15_1847460	18	When beekeepers check affected nests , the combs are filled with pollen and honey , but there is almost nobody home : the workers have largely vanished , leaving the queen in an unnatural state of quiet near-solitude , helpless on her own .
2007_05_15_1847460	19	That a queen can not survive without her court is a testament to the incomparable interdependence of social insect society , the pulsing , groupthinking superorganism that is the honeybee hive .
2007_05_15_1847460	20	Honeybees in a colony are as close-knit as cashmere , sharing up to three-quarters of their genes , compared with the 50 percent link between human siblings , and that strong kinship helps explain their highly cooperative style .
2007_05_15_1847460	21	They are also nearly all female .
2007_05_15_1847460	22	Less than 1 percent of the hive dwellers are drones , short-lived , bug-eyed males built to mate once with a queen before dropping dead to the ground with an audible pop .
2007_05_15_1847460	23	There is no top-down structure to honeybee society , no central command post or leaders with whips .
2007_05_15_1847460	24	Power is disseminated through the hive , and daily decisions about , say , whose turn it is to feed the larvae , take out the trash or fan the nectar into honey are made consensually and regionally , through a constant exchange of chemical , tactile and visual cues . ''
2007_05_15_1847460	25	It 's a lot of local responses to local stimuli , '' Dr. Robinson said . ''
2007_05_15_1847460	26	Little things collectively give rise to decisions . ''
2007_05_15_1847460	27	As for the queen , she is so far from being a decisive potentate that she can seem goofily out of the loop .
2007_05_15_1847460	28	When a colony is ready to move to a new hive , for example , about three dozen scout bees appraise the local real estate , consult with one another and with other workers and finally , communally , settle on the best new spot .
2007_05_15_1847460	29	Come moving day , the queen has no idea where to go and must be shown the way .
2007_05_15_1847460	30	The queen has n't time for gossip or bee-blogging .
2007_05_15_1847460	31	She is too busy laying eggs .
2007_05_15_1847460	32	That is her sole job , and one that she alone can do , for the other females in the hive lack working reproductive parts .
2007_05_15_1847460	33	Day in , day out , the queen remains in her climate-controlled chamber laying eggs , one or two per minute , maybe 2,500 a day .
2007_05_15_1847460	34	All the while she is pushed , provisioned and plucked by her retinue of nurses , her bristles kept spotless , her mandibles kept stuffed with the nutritious , high-calorie , egg-enabling delicacy called royal jelly . ''
2007_05_15_1847460	35	I 'd say that being queen is the absolute worst job in the hive , '' said May R. Berenbaum , a professor of entomology at the University of Illinois . ''
2007_05_15_1847460	36	At least the foragers get out for fresh air and some scenery . ''
2007_05_15_1847460	37	What the queen lacks in liberty , though , she makes up for in longevity .
2007_05_15_1847460	38	Whereas worker bees live only two or three months , a queen lives two or three years , and some have been known to survive to age 8 .
2007_05_15_1847460	39	Scientists are just beginning to understand how the queen so dramatically outlives her workers , when she and they arise from the same genetic roots .
2007_05_15_1847460	40	Dr. Robinson and his colleagues reported last month that a queen 's early exposure to royal jelly , which allowed her to mature into a queen rather than a worker , may offer her a lifetime of antioxidant protection against cellular decay .
2007_05_15_1847460	41	However she manages , the queen bee defies the normal rule in biology that organisms must choose between a long life and high fecundity .
2007_05_15_1847460	42	Her loyal subjects need her , and so she doughtily broods on .
2007_05_15_1847460	43	Now will they please return the favor and come back home ?
2007_05_15_1847461	0	Q. I am a veterinarian .
2007_05_15_1847461	1	The last time I went to my supplier for medical oxygen , only industrial oxygen was available .
2007_05_15_1847461	2	What is the difference between the two products ?
2007_05_15_1847461	3	Does industrial oxygen have harmful contaminants ?
2007_05_15_1847461	4	I have heard that it is sometimes recommended for emergency use in third-world countries .
2007_05_15_1847461	5	A. '' There is practically no difference between industrial and medical oxygen , '' said Ravi K. Bansal , chief executive of the Airsep Corporation of Buffalo , which produces both kinds .
2007_05_15_1847461	6	The two come from the same source and are produced the same way , he said , but to sell oxygen as medical gas , as with any prescription drug , regulations must be complied with to ensure that it is being properly dispensed and that it is traceable , with a lot number in the event of a recall . ''
2007_05_15_1847461	7	It needs to be tracked , and sometimes tested if it is repackaged , as it moves along the distribution channel , '' Dr. Bansal said .
2007_05_15_1847461	8	Industrial oxygen contains no harmful contaminants , he said , and is separated from air by a process in which air , collected in its gaseous form , is liquefied at very cold temperatures .
2007_05_15_1847461	9	The different constituent gases boil off at different temperatures , making it possible to capture pure oxygen .
2007_05_15_1847461	10	C. CLAIBORNE RAY Q + A
2007_05_15_1847462	0	Mainstream climatologists who have feared that global warming could have the paradoxical effect of cooling northwestern Europe or even plunging it into a small ice age have stopped worrying about that particular disaster , although it retains a vivid hold on the public imagination .
2007_05_15_1847462	1	The idea , which held climate theorists in its icy grip for years , was that the North Atlantic Current , an extension of the Gulf Stream that cuts northeast across the Atlantic Ocean to bathe the high latitudes of Europe with warmish equatorial water , could shut down in a greenhouse world .
2007_05_15_1847462	2	Without that warm-water current , Americans on the Eastern Seaboard would most likely feel a chill , but the suffering would be greater in Europe , where major cities lie far to the north .
2007_05_15_1847462	3	Britain , northern France , the Low Countries , Denmark and Norway could in theory take on Arctic aspects that only a Greenlander could love , even as the rest of the world sweltered .
2007_05_15_1847462	4	All that has now been removed from the forecast .
2007_05_15_1847462	5	Not only is northern Europe warming , but every major climate model produced by scientists worldwide in recent years has also shown that the warming will almost certainly continue . ''
2007_05_15_1847462	6	The concern had previously been that we were close to a threshold where the Atlantic circulation system would stop , '' said Susan Solomon , a senior scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration . ''
2007_05_15_1847462	7	We now believe we are much farther from that threshold , thanks to improved modeling and ocean measurements .
2007_05_15_1847462	8	The Gulf Stream and the North Atlantic Current are more stable than previously thought . ''
2007_05_15_1847462	9	After consulting 23 climate models , the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said in February it was '' very unlikely '' that the crucial flow of warm water to Europe would stall in this century .
2007_05_15_1847462	10	The panel did say that the gradual melting of the Greenland ice sheet along with increased precipitation in the far north were likely to weaken the North Atlantic Current by 25 percent through 2100 .
2007_05_15_1847462	11	But the panel added that any cooling effect in Europe would be overwhelmed by a general warming of the atmosphere , a warming that the panel said was under way as a result of rising concentrations of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases . ''
2007_05_15_1847462	12	The bottom line is that the atmosphere is warming up so much that a slowdown of the North Atlantic Current will never be able to cool Europe , '' said Helge Drange , a professor at the Nansen Environmental and Remote Sensing Center in Bergen , Norway .
2007_05_15_1847462	13	Temperate Europe is vulnerable because of its northern perch .
2007_05_15_1847462	14	The latitude of Britain equals that of frigid Newfoundland .
2007_05_15_1847462	15	Norway corresponds to the southern half of Greenland .
2007_05_15_1847462	16	The annual mean temperature difference of 10 to 20 degrees across the North Atlantic ( all temperature units shown here are in Fahrenheit ) is often entirely attributed to the North Atlantic Current .
2007_05_15_1847462	17	But in recent years , climatologists have said prevailing winds and other factors independent of the current are responsible for at least half of the temperature anomaly .
2007_05_15_1847462	18	For the European warm-water current to stop altogether , the Greenland ice sheet would have to melt fast enough to create a vast freshwater pool in the North Atlantic .
2007_05_15_1847462	19	Freshwater dilution on that scale would make the current less dense , preventing its two main strands from sinking south of Iceland and west of Norway as they must before they can double back toward the Equator on the underside of what is often called the Atlantic conveyor belt . ''
2007_05_15_1847462	20	The ocean circulation is a robust feature , and you really need to hit it hard to make it stop , '' said Eystein Jansen , a paleoclimatologist who directs the Bjerknes Center for Climate Research , also in Bergen . ''
2007_05_15_1847462	21	The Greenland ice sheet would not only have to melt , but to dynamically disintegrate on a huge scale across the entire sheet . ''
2007_05_15_1847462	22	The worst imaginable collapse would likely take centuries to play out , he said .
2007_05_15_1847462	23	Any disruption to the North Atlantic Current -- whose volume is 30 times greater than all the rivers in the world combined -- would thus occur beyond the time horizon of the United Nations climate panel .
2007_05_15_1847462	24	The last big freshwater dilution is thought to have occurred 8,200 years ago , when a huge lake atop the retreating North American ice sheet burst through to the Atlantic .
2007_05_15_1847462	25	For about 160 years , Dr. Jansen said , Europe experienced a severe chill that today would '' stress society quite a lot . ''
2007_05_15_1847462	26	If the North Atlantic Current weakened 25 percent this century , fractionally offsetting the effect of global warming , Britain in 2100 would still be about 4 degrees warmer than today , the United Nations panel estimated .
2007_05_15_1847462	27	In France , the net warming would be 5 degrees and here in Norway a bit more , depending on latitude .
2007_05_15_1847462	28	When climate modelers simulate a 50 percent slackening of the North Atlantic Current , they still see a net warming in those countries .
2007_05_15_1847462	29	It is when they completely switch off the current , as they say nature is disinclined to do , that the European climate cools to a level below that of today .
2007_05_15_1847462	30	Scientists at the Hadley Center for Climate Prediction and Research near London found that a shutdown of the North Atlantic Current in 2049 would cause temperatures in most of Britain and Norway to fall from a level several degrees warmer than today to a level 4 or 5 degrees chillier than today .
2007_05_15_1847462	31	That would be enough to curtail agriculture sharply .
2007_05_15_1847462	32	France , though , would still be slightly warmer than it is now .
2007_05_15_1847462	33	In a 1998 cover article for The Atlantic Monthly titled '' The Great Climate Flip-flop , '' William H. Calvin spelled out a worst-case scenario for Atlantic Ocean dynamics and concluded , '' I hope never to see a failure of the northernmost loop of the North Atlantic Current , because the result would be a population crash that would take much of civilization with it , all within a decade . ''
2007_05_15_1847462	34	In 2004 , the makers of the Hollywood blockbuster '' The Day After Tomorrow '' imagined the sudden icing over of Manhattan after a disruption in North Atlantic currents .
2007_05_15_1847462	35	Europe 's fate was alluded to by the implied flash-freezing of the British royal family in Balmoral Castle .
2007_05_15_1847462	36	Preparing for a cold future has never been high on the political agenda .
2007_05_15_1847462	37	Perhaps understandably , European leaders have been more preoccupied with responding to the 2003 summer heat wave that killed 15,000 people across France and the need for new dike technology to keep the Netherlands from being inundated by rising seas associated with melting ice caps .
2007_05_15_1847462	38	Richard Seager , a senior research scientist at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University in Palisades , N.Y. , said thatEuropeans should trust what they feel in the air . ''
2007_05_15_1847462	39	Britain and western Europe have had one heat wave after another so far this century , '' Dr. Seager said . ''
2007_05_15_1847462	40	The idea that anyone is worried about a new ice age I find rather odd . ''
2007_05_15_1847465	0	It is hard to escape the message that whole grains are good for you .
2007_05_15_1847465	1	But few Americans put it into practice .
2007_05_15_1847465	2	By some estimates , fewer than 1 in 10 adults eat three servings of whole grains a day .
2007_05_15_1847465	3	And about 4 out of 10 eat none .
2007_05_15_1847465	4	Now a new study adds strength to the argument that a better diet can lead directly to better health .
2007_05_15_1847465	5	Writing in the online edition of the journal Nutrition , Metabolism and Cardiovascular Diseases , researchers say they have confirmed a clear connection between whole-grain intake and the risk of cardiovascular disease . ''
2007_05_15_1847465	6	In light of this evidence , '' write the authors , led by Dr. Philip B. Mellen of Wake Forest University , '' policy makers , scientists and clinicians should redouble efforts to incorporate clear messages on the beneficial effects of whole grains into public health and clinical practice endeavors . ''
2007_05_15_1847465	7	The researchers based their findings on a review of seven earlier studies that followed people 's diets and health over time .
2007_05_15_1847465	8	In all , more than 285,000 people were involved .
2007_05_15_1847465	9	The new study found that on average , people who ate two and a half servings of whole grains a day had a 21 percent lower risk of developing cardiovascular disease than those who ate a fifth of a serving .
2007_05_15_1847465	10	Whole grains can come from numerous sources , including whole-wheat flour , oatmeal and popcorn .
2007_05_15_1847466	0	Researchers have long known that people who drink moderate amounts of alcohol appear to be less likely to develop heart disease .
2007_05_15_1847466	1	Much of the benefit has been attributed to the higher levels of HDL cholesterol -- often referred to as the '' good '' cholesterol -- found in moderate drinkers .
2007_05_15_1847466	2	The lipoproteins in this kind of cholesterol are believed to help the body fight off heart disease .
2007_05_15_1847466	3	But a new study suggests that alcohol may play another role in cholesterol and health .
2007_05_15_1847466	4	Moderate drinking may encourage the formation of larger lipoprotein particles in both HDL and LDL , the '' bad '' cholesterol associated with cardiovascular problems .
2007_05_15_1847466	5	Larger particles in HDL , the researchers wrote in the online edition of The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism , have recently been found to appear better at fighting off heart disease .
2007_05_15_1847466	6	And larger particles in LDL appear to be less effective at causing it .
2007_05_15_1847466	7	In that case , the higher the number of large LDL particles , and the lower the number of small ones , the better the chance of avoiding heart disease .
2007_05_15_1847466	8	The researchers , led by Dr. Kenneth J. Mukamal of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston , a Harvard affiliate , matched the alcohol intake of more than 1,800 people with their cholesterol levels and the size of cholesterol particles .
2007_05_15_1847466	9	Those who had one or more drinks a week had the greatest number of large LDL particles .
2007_05_15_1847466	10	Those who had 7 to 13 drinks a week had the lowest number of small ones .
2007_05_15_1847467	0	Something about being in government or law enforcement must bring out the Peeping Tom in people .
2007_05_15_1847467	1	Every couple of decades the amount of Big Brothering being practiced in the United States -- by J. Edgar Hoover , for instance , or the Watergate crowd -- bubbles to the surface .
2007_05_15_1847467	2	And once the furor has subsided , we are left with the uneasy sense that such shenanigans are probably the rule rather than the exception .
2007_05_15_1847467	3	But in '' Spying on the Home Front , '' tonight on PBS 's '' Frontline , '' Hedrick Smith does n't merely re-sound the familiar alarm that public officials are rooting through our mail and phone records .
2007_05_15_1847467	4	He suggests that the domestic surveillance begun by the Bush administration after the attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 , redefines the legal standards on which the United States was founded .
2007_05_15_1847467	5	Old standard : Law enforcement 's job is to seek out a specific suspect and/or investigate a specific crime .
2007_05_15_1847467	6	New standard : Everyone is a suspect , and the crimes will be specified when those in charge are good and ready .
2007_05_15_1847467	7	Mr. Smith 's look at the activities of an alphabet soup of government agencies involved in the anti-terrorism campaign is a bit jumbled , in part because way too much has been happening on this front to cover in an hour .
2007_05_15_1847467	8	But he imposes some order by focusing in particular on Las Vegas , late 2003 .
2007_05_15_1847467	9	Anyone who took a mistress on a quick getaway to that city around then or was rolling dice when the boss thought he was at a business conference should not watch this program .
2007_05_15_1847467	10	The government had information indicating a possible terrorist attack , and it swept up casino and hotel records in a big , all-inclusive batch .
2007_05_15_1847467	11	Mr. Smith uses this as a springboard to talk to current and former officials and assorted experts about the increasing use of data mining -- collecting an undifferentiated mass of information , then combing it for deviance and clues -- and its implications for personal liberty .
2007_05_15_1847467	12	And eventually he gets to the most intriguing question this all raises , one that transcends the Bush administration and even the war on terror : Are we willing to accept this world without privacy as the new order ?
2007_05_15_1847467	13	The government , as the program notes , is only one factor ; marketers and other private information gathers have already turned all of us into files that would have set Hoover to salivating . ''
2007_05_15_1847467	14	Is it inevitable that we 're moving towards a world in which this kind of mass data mining and analysis is just going to happen ? ''
2007_05_15_1847467	15	Mr. Smith asks late in the program .
2007_05_15_1847467	16	But the question is a beat behind the reality he has already laid out .
2007_05_15_1847467	17	It 's more than inevitable ; we already did let it happen .
2007_05_15_1847467	18	And no one who speaks in the program offers much hope of getting this nosy genie back in the bottle .

2007_05_15_1847468	0	The Divine Sarah is what they used to call Sarah Bernhardt .
2007_05_15_1847468	1	The Divine Sara is what some New York dancegoers began to call Sara Rudner in the 1970s .
2007_05_15_1847468	2	Ms Rudner is one of those rare artists who embody the art form they practice : a born dancer , sensuous and infinitely expressive , with a fluent body gifted in feats of multiple coordination , intense focus and effortless control over long , complex phrases of movement .
2007_05_15_1847468	3	To borrow the brilliant title of the dance historian Sally Banes 's definitive history of the New York 1960s generation of experimentalists , Ms. Rudner is Terpsichore in sneakers .
2007_05_15_1847468	4	Though she worked with Twyla Tharp while Ms. Tharp 's work took off into bravura areas of partnering , storytelling and virtuoso technique , Ms. Rudner 's own dancing has always exemplified the most beautiful control of what has been called '' democratic dance . ''
2007_05_15_1847468	5	Give her movements that , individually , most of us could do -- shimmy , twist , walk , fall , kick -- and she combines them into a rich , witty lyricism that is at once intoxicating and as natural as bird song .
2007_05_15_1847468	6	Her work with 16 female colleagues ( all experienced , some well known ) on Sunday , '' Dancing-on-View ( Preview/Hindsight ) , '' at the Baryshnikov Arts Center , involved ensembles of layered musical complexity and a wide range of enthralling duets and solos .
2007_05_15_1847468	7	As the performance developed , we came to see the particular gifts of each dancer , some only gradually , some almost immediately .
2007_05_15_1847468	8	And though large parts of the dancing occurred , rivetingly , in silence , Ms. Rudner 's use of music was still better .
2007_05_15_1847468	9	Sometimes she played a Glenn Miller recording , but the most marvelous sequences were those when the musicians William Catanzaro and Jerome Morris provided live accompaniment on piano , accordion , harmonica and a wide range of percussion , evoking sound worlds now like the Balinese gamelan , now like a country and western song .
2007_05_15_1847468	10	The marvel lay in the changing imagination with which music was juxtaposed against dance : sometimes brisk against movement from one long-held pose to another , sometimes exotic against dancing that basically consisted of walking in circles .
2007_05_15_1847468	11	To watch a Rudner dance is to see a constant interplay of impulses : The hips shift gorgeously from side to side , while the knees bend , the insteps tread , the shoulders shift .
2007_05_15_1847468	12	Even when just walking in circles , the dancers are waving arms in sweeping horizontal patterns and tilting the whole body .
2007_05_15_1847468	13	The phrases are fascinatingly long and diverse , linking movement ideas that seem drawn from Asian and Egyptian sculpture ( Buddha , Krishna , the Sphinx ) with wholly modern gestures ( as if hitching a ride , checking a wristwatch ) .
2007_05_15_1847468	14	Ms. Rudner often sets them polyphonically , so that we 're watching up to eight separate phrases at one time .
2007_05_15_1847468	15	Her musical deployment is always spatially absorbing too : Two groups of dancers will make a rolling bas-relief round the peripheries of the stage while a duet in another tone and tempo occupies the center .
2007_05_15_1847468	16	In one solo for herself , '' The Talkie , '' evoking her 1960s past with Ms. Tharp , Ms. Rudner chose to answer questions while dancing .
2007_05_15_1847468	17	More than once her answer , tenderly , was '' These are the good old days . ''
2007_05_15_1847468	18	As she danced , the sun was setting behind her , the sky glowing , and the day was indeed very good .
2007_05_15_1847471	0	A humble sign on the window of a new storefront in Lower Manhattan yesterday encouraged passers-by to take a trip , one that could be long or quite brief depending on the traveler : '' Explore Your Inner Self . ''
2007_05_15_1847471	1	Lisa Reynolds , a city social worker who paused in front of the window with her co-worker , Judy Speller , on their way back from lunch , quickly found that there were few ways to ignore this advice .
2007_05_15_1847471	2	Just a few feet inside the locked storefront lay another storefront that looked exactly like it , down to the neon , the graffiti , the lonesome potted plant in the window and the gum stains on the floor .
2007_05_15_1847471	3	And just inside that window was another one .
2007_05_15_1847471	4	And then another and another .
2007_05_15_1847471	5	The little yellow paper note ( s ) taped to the door ( s ) that read '' Back in 5 '' was , it turned out , a literal description .
2007_05_15_1847471	6	The storefront repeats five times , like a hiccup in reality 's hard drive , a little crimp in the space-time continuum secreted away on Maiden Lane between a florist 's shop and a Dress Barn .
2007_05_15_1847471	7	For Ms. Reynolds , the inner exploration yesterday morning involved trying to figure out whether she was having a brain malfunction . ''
2007_05_15_1847471	8	The more you look at it , the more confused you get , '' Ms. Reynolds finally said , laughing and cupping her hands around her eyes to stare deep inside . ''
2007_05_15_1847471	9	Is that the intention ? ''
2007_05_15_1847471	10	Not exactly , said Beth Campbell , a Brooklyn artist who created this storefront-of-storefronts over the last several weeks with the help of the Public Art Fund and several friends and fellow artists .
2007_05_15_1847471	11	Ms. Campbell 's work often deals in repetition , not so much in the Warhol art-meets-advertising tradition of multiple Marilyns or soup cans but more in the spirit of science fiction that unsettles the senses : wormholes in perception , vortexes in viewing .
2007_05_15_1847471	12	At the Roebling Hall gallery in Brooklyn in 2000 she created two hyper-realistic women 's bedrooms , identical down to the creases in the sheets , and then connected the bedrooms by a hallway .
2007_05_15_1847471	13	You left one , walked into the next and wondered if you were trapped in a very specialized circle of hell , one strewn with underwear , self-help books , cigarette butts and posters of the Artist Formerly Known as Prince .
2007_05_15_1847471	14	One critic called it '' an obsessive-compulsive 's own private nightmare . ''
2007_05_15_1847471	15	Ms. Campbell , 35 , said she was partly inspired to create the storefront -- which appears to be a vague combination of travel agency and life-coaching service -- by the nameless stores she sees in Greenpoint , where she lives . ''
2007_05_15_1847471	16	They 're kind of like Fed Ex and UPS places that sell milk and Avon , and maybe you can get your taxes done there , '' she said .
2007_05_15_1847471	17	But the idea arose more from a desire to create a public artwork that did not immediately announce itself as art , one that caught people in mid-stride and played with their expectations and their perceptions of real and recreated , copy and original .
2007_05_15_1847471	18	Yesterday morning when a reporter arrived , Ms. Campbell was attending to a few last details inside the store , or artwork , officially titled '' Potential Store Fronts , '' which will remain on view at 125 Maiden Lane through June 24 . ''
2007_05_15_1847471	19	Sorry about that , '' she said , coming out of the store , which formerly sold men 's suits . ''
2007_05_15_1847471	20	I 'm really not supposed to be inside the piece . ''
2007_05_15_1847471	21	As she stood noticing people who began to notice the store , she described the characteristic reaction : slow , skip-step , double-take and head-turn . ''
2007_05_15_1847471	22	Which is always exciting for me , '' she said .
2007_05_15_1847471	23	Brynn Jarosh , who works at a corporate child-care center , walked by with two toddlers in tow and did the full stop , staring deep into one of the bay windows , with a sign offering personalized lie-detector tests and another announcing , apropos of nothing in particular , '' Growth , in moderately controlled conditions . '' ''
2007_05_15_1847471	24	It 's funny , '' Ms. Jarosh said , '' but I never ever would have thought that this was an art installation . ''
2007_05_15_1847471	25	I could n't figure out what it was , to tell the truth . ''
2007_05_15_1847471	26	Then she added , beaming at Ms. Campbell : '' I like it .
2007_05_15_1847471	27	Ms. Campbell thanked her .
2007_05_15_1847471	28	She admits that , as she and her helpers , including her husband , neared the end of 12 - and 14-hour days making the storefronts , she did sometimes become obsessive about the details of this particular job .
2007_05_15_1847471	29	She insisted that a thin metal strip be added to replicate one on the street that separates the sidewalk from the entryway .
2007_05_15_1847471	30	She figured out a way , using glue stick , to mimic perfectly the graffiti that some anonymous artist long before her had etched on the front glass .
2007_05_15_1847471	31	And last weekend she went back in just to replicate the blackish chewing-gum splats , those spontaneous urban art forms , in front of the door . ''
2007_05_15_1847471	32	But maybe you should n't tell anyone that , '' she said , smiling . ''
2007_05_15_1847471	33	It sounds a little crazy . '' ''
2007_05_15_1847471	34	Potential Store Fronts '' will remain on view through June 24 at 125 Maiden Lane , Lower Manhattan .
2007_05_15_1847472	0	A portrait of the artist as a confused young black man emerges in vivid colors in the fresh , exuberant and bitingly funny new musical '' Passing Strange , '' which opened last night at the Public Theater .
2007_05_15_1847472	1	The biography of a songwriter on a wayward journey of self-discovery , this bracingly inventive show introduces an exciting new voice to contemporary musical theater , a witty wordsmith , composer and performer who goes by the single name Stew .
2007_05_15_1847472	2	Stew has a cult following as a performer and recording artist , but to look at him , you 'd never take him for a rock troubadour .
2007_05_15_1847472	3	Bald and big-bellied , with a neat goatee and quirky eyeglasses , he has an air more professorial than swoon-inducing .
2007_05_15_1847472	4	Narrating the story of his life in song , sometimes from a podium or a desk , he slides those glasses up his big , domed forehead to peer skeptically at the dubious antics of his fictionalized younger self , played with impish spirit by Daniel Breaker .
2007_05_15_1847472	5	Stew watches in sorrow , amazement and occasional embarrassment as the callow young man he once was struts and struggles , pouts and fusses his way to maturity on a voyage that takes him from the not-so-mean streets of Los Angeles to the hash bars of Amsterdam and the post-punk cabarets of Berlin .
2007_05_15_1847472	6	But Professor Stew can also play a mean guitar , and when necessary , he strides the stage like an evangelical preacher , or a preening rocker , to whip the audience into a froth .
2007_05_15_1847472	7	Part concert , with Stew leading an onstage band ; part book musical with a full ( and terrific ) cast , '' Passing Strange '' defies generic categories .
2007_05_15_1847472	8	This is wholly appropriate , since the story being told does n't run in any of the familiar grooves of the African-American experience in 20th-century America .
2007_05_15_1847472	9	And if it does trace the classic story of the artist as a self-styled outsider at odds with mainstream culture ( as personified by Mom ) , '' Passing Strange '' sets this boilerplate arc to a quirky new rhythm .
2007_05_15_1847472	10	Our hero-rebel grew up comfortably in black bourgeois Los Angeles , '' a colored paradise where the palm trees sway , '' and there 's hardly a word about the cruelties of racism in American culture in '' Passing Strange . ''
2007_05_15_1847472	11	( Hardly an earnest word , anyway .
2007_05_15_1847472	12	One highlight is a hilarious mock-minstrel song in which Stew lampoons the way he once capitalized on stereotypes about the black American experience to gain some street cred with German radicals . )
2007_05_15_1847472	13	As a teenager , Stew was a Zen Buddhist who smirked at the hats of the ladies in church , at least until one Sunday when '' the organ whispered a promise , '' the spirit moved him to ecstasy , and he found himself called not to God but to the making of music and the forging of a life in art .
2007_05_15_1847472	14	( His mother , played with wry warmth by Eisa Davis , is not pleased . ''
2007_05_15_1847472	15	Do n't you know the difference between the sacred and the profane ? ''
2007_05_15_1847472	16	Citing his own scripture to defend his pronouncement that '' church ai n't nothin ' but rock 'n' roll , '' the young Stew stutters back , '' But it was on PBS ! '' )
2007_05_15_1847472	17	After that epiphany , Stew joins the choir and forms a bond with its leader , the pastor 's flamboyant son Mr. Franklin ( a charismatic Colman Domingo , also terrific as a ranting Berlin performance artist ) .
2007_05_15_1847472	18	In a scene both ruefully funny and tender , the young Stew gets high with Mr. Franklin as they listen to Puccini in a blue VW bug .
2007_05_15_1847472	19	The desolation of a life lived in compromise is brought home to him in a haze of pot smoke .
2007_05_15_1847472	20	Mr. Franklin worships Maria Callas , regrets his own timidity and urges the young Stew to escape to Europe and find his real spiritual home . ''
2007_05_15_1847472	21	I mean , baby , we 're all freaks depending on the backdrop , '' he shrugs .
2007_05_15_1847472	22	Bright-eyed with wonder , young Stew jokes that they 're both '' black folks passing for black folks . ''
2007_05_15_1847472	23	The music , composed by Stew and Heidi Rodewald ( who also plays bass ) , is straight-ahead guitar-driven rock rather than rhythm and blues ( though of course the line between them is easily blurred ) .
2007_05_15_1847472	24	As Stew searches for his own musical voice , the disparate styles referred to range from '60s Europop to '70s punk to '80s electronic to Gilbert and Sullivan and Kurt Weill .
2007_05_15_1847472	25	The score contains a tiny musical quote ( a joke , really ) from James Brown , but also a smidgen of '' My Fair Lady . ''
2007_05_15_1847472	26	Stew 's gift for smart comic wordplay would be the envy of many a rapper , but the more lyrical passages in '' Passing Strange '' are carefully sculptured , considered and reflective , not hot and bothered .
2007_05_15_1847472	27	( Occasionally , Stew does try a little too hard for poetic profundity . )
2007_05_15_1847472	28	The show follows the budding musician from his garage-band days in Los Angeles to coffeehouses in Amsterdam , where he indulges in the usual condiments of a rock 'n' roll life , and from there to Berlin , where he falls in with a group of political and aesthetic radicals . ''
2007_05_15_1847472	29	Celibacy is the only sane response to a world gone wild , '' declares one new friend , a '' critical theorist and postmodern pornographer . '' ''
2007_05_15_1847472	30	My porno films feature fully clothed men making business deals . '' ''
2007_05_15_1847472	31	Narrative is a capitalist plot ! ''
2007_05_15_1847472	32	is the rallying cry of another .
2007_05_15_1847472	33	If so , '' Passing Strange '' is not likely to face accusations of spreading the doctrine .
2007_05_15_1847472	34	As the show ambles past the two-hour mark , its episodic story line becomes a liability .
2007_05_15_1847472	35	Because Stew 's aesthetic and moral awakening takes place against a shifting backdrop , no other characters stick around long enough to claim a full role in the proceedings , despite perfectly pitched comic performances from the whole cast .
2007_05_15_1847472	36	The spectacle of watching a young man try on various emotional and artistic attitudes will strike happy chords in the hearts of ex-dreamers of youthful dreams , but colder eyes may see it as an extended exercise in musical navel-gazing .
2007_05_15_1847472	37	Still , engagement is sustained by the unusual combination of driving rock music and a tart satiric tone , a delicate balance that the show maintains throughout with surprising ease .
2007_05_15_1847472	38	Although some sequences would benefit from trimming , the director , Annie Dorsen , shapes the individual scenes smartly and effectively , with the help of the modern-dance choreographer Karole Armitage ( '' movement coordinator '' is her credit ) , who keeps the energetic cast in almost constant motion when it 's center stage .
2007_05_15_1847472	39	( I should acknowledge that Ms. Dorsen is an acquaintance . )
2007_05_15_1847472	40	For all its witty puncturing of youthful pretension , and despite the sardonic attitude Stew often strikes toward his younger self , '' Passing Strange '' is also full of heart .
2007_05_15_1847472	41	It dares in its playful way to honor those big questions that have set adolescent souls yearning for centuries .
2007_05_15_1847472	42	How to discover and be true to your convictions , how to live a meaningful life and still pay the bills , how to find the understanding you need without throwing away the love you 're offered .
2007_05_15_1847472	43	Its mournful finale also acknowledges the damage that accrues in those heedless years spent asking them with such stridency , before you come to realize that learning to listen is just as important as making yourself heard .

2007_05_15_1847472	48	WITH : De'Adre Aziza ( Edwina/Marianna/Sudabey ) , Daniel Breaker ( Youth ) , Eisa Davis ( Mother ) , Colman Domingo ( Mr. Franklin/Joop/Mr .

2007_05_15_1847473	0	When Bob Barker got out of the Navy at the end of World War II , he thought about becoming a flight instructor .
2007_05_15_1847473	1	But he had heard about an opening at a radio station and thought it sounded interesting .
2007_05_15_1847473	2	He had also heard that the station manager liked airplanes .
2007_05_15_1847473	3	So Mr. Barker did what any sensible job applicant would do . ''
2007_05_15_1847473	4	I put on my naval officer 's uniform and my wings of gold and went in and talked about airplanes for about 30 or 45 minutes , '' he said recently , '' and I had my first job in radio . ''
2007_05_15_1847473	5	When he is hugging grandmothers or quizzing college students or consoling anguished overbidders on the set of '' The Price Is Right , '' it is hard to imagine that anything as crass as ambition is what motivates Bob Barker .
2007_05_15_1847473	6	But nobody gets to do anything quite so public as be the host of television 's most popular game show for 35 years without setting a few goals .
2007_05_15_1847473	7	How he achieved many of them will become clear starting on Wednesday , when CBS will broadcast two consecutive nights of prime-time specials celebrating Mr. Barker 's retirement , the first a special edition of '' The Price Is Right '' and the second a retrospective of Mr. Barker 's 50 years in television .
2007_05_15_1847473	8	Few people in show business have come as far as Mr. Barker .
2007_05_15_1847473	9	When he was born , his parents were living in a tent in rural Washington .
2007_05_15_1847473	10	His father died when he was 6 , and he grew up on the Rosebud Indian Reservation in South Dakota , where his mother was a schoolteacher .
2007_05_15_1847473	11	He went on to train as a Navy fighter pilot during World War II , but the war ended before he was sent to battle .
2007_05_15_1847473	12	Then he got that job at the radio station , and everything changed .
2007_05_15_1847473	13	Fast forward some 60 years , and Mr. Barker , 83 , is now on the verge of retirement , having broken Johnny Carson 's record -- five years ago -- for the longest continuous performance on the same network television show and having won 17 Emmy Awards as a host and producer .
2007_05_15_1847473	14	He has received just about every honor the television industry has to offer , has been installed in the Television Academy Hall of Fame and works in the Bob Barker Studio at CBS Television City in Hollywood .
2007_05_15_1847473	15	And sometime in the next few months , CBS will show the final episode of '' The Price Is Right , '' featuring Mr. Barker . ''
2007_05_15_1847473	16	I have n't regretted the fact that I 've announced my retirement , '' Mr. Barker said in an interview recently in his home in the Hollywood Hills . ''
2007_05_15_1847473	17	I announced it in October , and I thought by November I 'd be regretting it .
2007_05_15_1847473	18	Now , I do n't know what it will be like when I wake up and find there 's no show .
2007_05_15_1847473	19	I may just pull the covers over my head and stay there . ''
2007_05_15_1847473	20	It is unlikely , however , that even a retired Bob Barker could do anything so passive .
2007_05_15_1847473	21	From the moment he began working at that radio station in Springfield , Mo. , he was looking for the next opportunity .
2007_05_15_1847473	22	Hired as a local news writer , he also began doing sportscasts .
2007_05_15_1847473	23	Then he filled a slot as a disc jockey .
2007_05_15_1847473	24	Then the host of one of the station 's regular audience-participation shows was unexpectedly absent one day , and Mr. Barker stepped in .
2007_05_15_1847473	25	When he arrived home that day , his wife , Dorothy Jo , who was also his high school sweetheart , told him that being the host of a show was what he should do . ''
2007_05_15_1847473	26	She said , ` You did that better than anything you 've ever done , ' '' he recalled . ''
2007_05_15_1847473	27	We set out from that moment forward to get a national show for me .
2007_05_15_1847473	28	She produced my shows , she helped me write them , she edited them , she did everything and anything to help me get a national show .
2007_05_15_1847473	29	And I 've been doing a show for 62 years . ''
2007_05_15_1847473	30	While '' The Price Is Right '' has been his longest-running show , at 35 years , people of a certain age will remember that before that there was '' Truth or Consequences , '' which Mr. Barker was host of for 18 years .
2007_05_15_1847473	31	A sort of game show in which the contestant had to answer an almost unanswerable question or face the consequences , which usually involved participation in a wacky stunt , it also often featured a '' This Is Your Life '' component of a reunion with a long-lost relative .
2007_05_15_1847473	32	Through those 50 years on television ( the two shows overlapped for three years ) , Mr. Barker has made a specialty of giving contestants the chance to make a dream come true .
2007_05_15_1847473	33	His great strength , and certainly the key to his longevity , is that , whatever happens to the contestants , he is able to have them leave happy , feeling unjudged and appreciated .
2007_05_15_1847473	34	Those 50 years have turned Mr. Barker into much the same person in private that he is on camera .
2007_05_15_1847473	35	He tells stories with the same measured cadence , mixing in a few self-deprecating jokes .
2007_05_15_1847473	36	And it does not take more than a couple of hours to begin to hear him repeat some lines or phrases that , deeper research shows , he has been saying in the same way and circumstances for decades .
2007_05_15_1847473	37	It has not all been fun and games , of course .
2007_05_15_1847473	38	Most notably , there were the lawsuits , one from a former model on '' The Price Is Right '' with whom the widowed Mr. Barker had an affair , another from a model who charged that she had been fired because her age and weight had begun creeping up .
2007_05_15_1847473	39	The lawsuits were dropped or settled , and Mr. Barker makes regular jokes about them now .
2007_05_15_1847473	40	Just about anyone who was born in the 20th century and spent a day home sick in bed has seen '' The Price Is Right , '' in which contestants '' Come on down ! ''
2007_05_15_1847473	41	from the studio audience and try to guess the price of prizes , from banjos to snowmobiles to appliances , pop-up trailers and , of course , a new car .
2007_05_15_1847473	42	Fiercer than the competition to win prizes , however , is the effort required to get on the show .
2007_05_15_1847473	43	On April 30 the first family in line for the studio audience arrived 29 hours before the taping was scheduled to begin .
2007_05_15_1847473	44	Because the audience fills up first come first served , more than 300 people had camped out overnight on Fairfax Avenue in Hollywood , wrapped in blankets purchased at a nearby Kmart .
2007_05_15_1847473	45	The competition was not always so fierce , but with only a few shows remaining before Mr. Barker 's retirement , few people are willing to leave the effort to chance .
2007_05_15_1847473	46	Chance sometimes wins , however .
2007_05_15_1847473	47	On the same day that one family waited 29 hours , the day 's showcase winner , Paula Bond , showed up with her sister and mother just a few hours before the taping and were put on a standby list .
2007_05_15_1847473	48	Two hours before the show , they were told that they would be getting in , and Ms. Bond left as the day 's big winner , with $ 36,388 in cash and prizes .
2007_05_15_1847473	49	The specific air date for the final episode with Mr. Barker as host of '' The Price Is Right '' has not been revealed , as that installment could be used to help promote the premiere of the show under a new host next fall .
2007_05_15_1847473	50	Who will replace Mr. Barker has been the subject of widespread speculation , though he insists he does not know the answer and will not be involved in the decision .
2007_05_15_1847473	51	Rosie O'Donnell is said to have expressed interest , and several potential replacements have been auditioned , including the actor Mario Lopez and Mark Steines , a host of '' Entertainment Tonight . ''
2007_05_15_1847473	52	Many observers doubted whether anyone would be able to replace Johnny Carson , whose longevity streak Mr. Barker surpassed .
2007_05_15_1847473	53	This retiring host , however , said he believed that the show would survive without him .
2007_05_15_1847473	54	While people 's looks might have changed over the years , he said , people '' have n't changed in any of the ways that are important . ''
2007_05_15_1847474	0	In the early 1970s , when few art galleries showed photography , the Midtown Y Photography Gallery was a rare pioneer devoted to the medium .
2007_05_15_1847474	1	An exhibition at the New York Public Library revisits the gallery 's 25-year history and the role it played as photography moved into the art world . ''
2007_05_15_1847474	2	Making the Scene : The Midtown Y Photography Gallery , 1972-1996 '' was organized by Stephen C. Pinson , the library 's curator of photography .
2007_05_15_1847474	3	Its more than 160 photographs track the fortunes of the gallery , which was founded in a corridor of the Emanu-El Midtown Y.M.-Y.W.H.A. by the photographer Larry Siegel , with the help of the financier and philanthropist Robert Menschel .
2007_05_15_1847474	4	The images are divided into three sections : a survey of photographers from the gallery 's two major phases ; selected work from its group shows ; and a group of pictures from Sy Rubin 's '' 14th St. , '' a project sponsored by the Midtown Y and carried out from 1979 to 1981 .
2007_05_15_1847474	5	With four more walls along the gallery 's perimeter devoted to topics like '' Gender and Color Photography '' and '' Alternative v. Mainstream , '' this is an information-intensive exhibition .
2007_05_15_1847474	6	But a nook at the back of the gallery offers an antidote : a '' screening room '' where you can take a break from reading wall texts and watch a slide show .
2007_05_15_1847474	7	Images in the section devoted to the gallery 's initial phase , 1972 to 1982 , include Barbara Walz 's hilarious photos of Jack LaLanne flexing his muscles for the camera ; David Attie 's '' Russian Self-Portraits , '' in which he invited subjects into the studio and had them trigger the shutter to take their own portraits ; Nathan Farb 's quirky photograph of a New Jersey couple hunched over their plates eating corn on the cob ; and Larry Fink 's hazy snapshot images of lounging figures , who look like disaffected characters from a Raymond Carver story .
2007_05_15_1847474	8	In 1983 Michael Spano took over from Mr. Siegel and Mr. Rubin as director , and the gallery 's second phase began .
2007_05_15_1847474	9	While business practices were looser in the first decade , now they became standardized : photographers chosen to exhibit ( usually three at a time ) paid a flat fee to cover the cost of printing invitations ; the money from any sales went directly to the artists .
2007_05_15_1847474	10	This section is leaner in quality , although among the images are two interesting examples of street photography : Dawoud Bey 's quietly poetic shots taken in places like Mexico and New York , which feature faceless figures moving through spaces streaked with light , and a blurry portrait by Ari Marcopoulos that appeared in a 1990 group show at the gallery titled '' Urban Scenes . ''
2007_05_15_1847474	11	A long wall is devoted to the '' 14th St. '' project , whose images borrow from William Klein and Robert Frank 's 1950s street photographs , a vocabulary extended in the 1960s and '70s by Diane Arbus and Garry Winogrand .
2007_05_15_1847474	12	In '' 14th St. '' Mr. Rubin focused on Manhattan 's longest cross street ( and the Midtown Y 's home ) .
2007_05_15_1847474	13	Street life is portrayed as a mix of quieter moments -- a Eugene Atget-style image of a mannequin in a shop window , an aerial view of a snowy Union Square Park -- and noisier ones , like a raucous band on stage in '' The Plasmatics at the Palladium , Irving Plaza . ''
2007_05_15_1847474	14	Brief selections from the gallery 's group shows take up another wall .
2007_05_15_1847474	15	The gallery 's inaugural group exhibition was '' Women Photographers '' ; later shows like '' The Jew in New York '' and '' Coming of Age in America '' explored how youth came to be valued over age in the United States . ''
2007_05_15_1847474	16	Coming of Age '' was one of the first shows in which Peter Hujar exhibited his photographs , and two are included here .
2007_05_15_1847474	17	One is his well-known image of a wrinkled clown , out of costume but in makeup , smoking a cigarette .
2007_05_15_1847474	18	The other depicts an androgynous young man surrounded by a body of water .
2007_05_15_1847474	19	The photograph most reproduced in conjunction with '' Making the Scene '' is also in this section : Arthur Tress 's fabulous photograph of boys lying on top of a batting cage , taken from beneath .
2007_05_15_1847474	20	Silhouetted against a bright sky , they look as if they 're flying .
2007_05_15_1847474	21	What is missing -- because it was missing in the Midtown Y Photography Gallery 's shows -- is the emergence of postmodernism or , if you do n't like that term , the moment when traditional art photography met its challengers .
2007_05_15_1847474	22	Rarely in '' Making the Scene '' do you see artists breaking out of the conventional photographic format .
2007_05_15_1847474	23	Even color photography is somewhat unusual ; most of the images here are black and white .
2007_05_15_1847474	24	Yet elsewhere during this period artists were turning to photography for everything from documenting performances to rephotographing existing works , exploring the narrative aspects of the medium and investigating the potential of color and digital technology .
2007_05_15_1847474	25	This issue is addressed directly in the section titled '' Alternative vs. Mainstream . ''
2007_05_15_1847474	26	It says that in 1982 , Andy Grundberg , writing in The New York Times , observed that photography had become so integrated into contemporary art that '' the segregated photography marketplace seems to be withering . ''
2007_05_15_1847474	27	Rather than join the alternative crowd ( whose works now populate many museums ) , the Midtown Y Photography Gallery remained a member of that segregated marketplace .
2007_05_15_1847474	28	Committed to a more conventional program , the gallery delved deeper into its context , exploring the city as it swung from near-bankruptcy to boomtown .
2007_05_15_1847474	29	Shows slanted toward New York themes included '' Brooklyn Bridge , '' '' City Games '' and '' Weekend in June , '' which documented a disarmament rally in New York in 1982 .
2007_05_15_1847474	30	The city 's upswing did n't save the gallery , which in 1993 moved to the Educational Alliance at 197 East Broadway , on the Lower East Side , and finally closed in 1996 .
2007_05_15_1847474	31	It 's fun , though , to imagine that cleared-out corridor in the Midtown Y on 14th Street , its walls lined with some of the very images now on view in this exhibition . ''
2007_05_15_1847474	32	Making the Scene : The Midtown Y Photography Gallery , 1972-1996 '' is on view through Sept. 16 at the New York Public Library , Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street ; (212) 661-7220 .
2007_05_15_1847475	0	ABC will continue to be the most aggressive of the networks with its lineup of new shows for the next television season , ordering at least 11 new series , when it officially announces its fall schedule to advertisers today .
2007_05_15_1847475	1	That network already has more big hits than any of its competitors and is looking to add to the total by bringing in the biggest list of new contenders .
2007_05_15_1847475	2	According to network and studio executives who know of the shows ABC has ordered , the network will add seven new hourlong dramas and four new comedies to its lineup .
2007_05_15_1847475	3	Most of these will come on the air in the fall , but many will be scheduled later in the season .
2007_05_15_1847475	4	Most prominent of the new entries will be '' Private Practice , '' the spinoff of ABC 's biggest hit , '' Grey 's Anatomy , '' starring Kate Walsh as a doctor who leaves Seattle Grace Hospital for a wellness clinic in Los Angeles -- and has further romantic and sexual adventures .
2007_05_15_1847475	5	That new series that is already generating the most positive talk , both inside and outside ABC , is a quirky romantic hourlong comedy-drama called '' Pushing Daisies , '' about a young man who discovers -- to the advantage of a homicide detective -- that with a touch he can both raise the dead and send them back again .
2007_05_15_1847475	6	His power complicates his relationship with a young woman he can love only unrequitedly .
2007_05_15_1847475	7	Lee Pace and Anna Friel play the couple , supported by Chi McBride and Kristin Chenoweth .
2007_05_15_1847475	8	Following in the footsteps of '' Desperate Housewives , '' ABC has another new drama with a catchy title in '' Dirty Sexy Money , '' in which Peter Krause ( '' Six Feet Under '' ) plays a lawyer for a venal corrupt family .
2007_05_15_1847475	9	Money is also a factor in '' Big Shots '' ( the title may change ) , about four rich corporate executives and their tribulations with business and women .
2007_05_15_1847475	10	Dylan McDermott ( '' The Practice '' ) and Joshua Malina ( '' The West Wing '' ) are among the stars . ''
2007_05_15_1847475	11	Cashmere Mafia '' is yet another series attempting to replicate the successful formula of '' Sex and the City , '' with a group of New York women in and out of romance .
2007_05_15_1847475	12	But this one was at least created by Darren Star , who also produced '' Sex . ''
2007_05_15_1847475	13	Lucy Liu ( '' Ally McBeal '' ) is among the stars . ''
2007_05_15_1847475	14	Women 's Murder Club '' is a self-explanatory crime procedural , with Angie Harmon ( '' Law & Order '' ) playing the main investigator .
2007_05_15_1847475	15	The final drama is '' Eli Stone , '' about a lawyer who may be crazy or may be a prophet .
2007_05_15_1847475	16	Jonny Lee Miller is the star , supported by Victor Garber ( '' Alias . '' )
2007_05_15_1847475	17	ABC has struggled mightily with comedy in recent years and so far is bringing back only one for a new season : '' Notes From the Underbelly . ''
2007_05_15_1847475	18	Its long-running '' According to Jim '' may return , but '' George Lopez '' has been canceled .
2007_05_15_1847475	19	Heading the list of new comedies is '' Sam I Am , '' which stars Christina Applegate as a woman who loses her memory in an accident , learns she was a rotten person and tries to reform . ''
2007_05_15_1847475	20	Cavemen '' will star some familiar faces : the guys in the Geico car-insurance commercials who look like cavemen but otherwise dress and talk like anyone else .

2007_05_15_1847475	23	Jerry O'Connell and Faith Ford ( '' Murphy Brown '' ) are among the stars .
2007_05_15_1847475	24	The final comedy is '' Miss Guided , '' about a young woman who returns to her old high school to become a guidance counselor .
2007_05_15_1847475	25	Judy Greer is the star .
2007_05_15_1847475	26	ABC is also bringing back the drama '' October Road , '' which had a brief run this spring , but is canceling '' What About Brian . ''
2007_05_15_1847475	27	NBC made it own schedule public yesterday , and it was , by its executive 's admission , a conservative lineup with only four new hours set for the fall .
2007_05_15_1847475	28	Kevin Reilly , the president of NBC Entertainment , said that adding more new series now was unwise because it is so difficult to market new shows in the fall .
2007_05_15_1847475	29	The key to the schedule is '' Bionic Woman , '' the remake of the 1970s series , which NBC has placed in the middle of the Wednesday lineup hoping , as Mr. Reilly put it , to '' blast a hole '' on the night . ''
2007_05_15_1847475	30	Life , '' the cop drama that follows it , is also new , meaning the network is placing two new shows in a row , a gambit with a low degree of success .
2007_05_15_1847475	31	The show getting the best spot on NBC 's schedule is '' Journeyman , '' a science fiction series that will reside on Mondays at 10 , right after the biggest hit of this season , '' Heroes . ''
2007_05_15_1847475	32	The fourth new NBC drama for fall is '' Chuck , '' which will try to marry the comedy of '' The 40-Year-Old Virgin '' to a high-tech action series .
2007_05_15_1847475	33	It will run Tuesdays at 9 .
2007_05_15_1847475	34	The biggest news out of NBC concerned several of its returning series .
2007_05_15_1847475	35	NBC wants to get the most out of these as possible , and so it is ordering 30 half-hours of its hit comedy '' The Office , '' 25 of its other Thursday night comedy success '' My Name Is Earl '' and 30 of '' Heroes . ''
2007_05_15_1847475	36	All are above the normal order of 22 for a typical show . ''
2007_05_15_1847475	37	Heroes '' will actually be a kind of hybrid of sorts because 24 of the episodes will be regular editions of '' Heroes '' and the other six will be a related idea called '' Heroes : Origins . ''
2007_05_15_1847475	38	At least five of the '' The Office '' shows will be hourlong episodes .
2007_05_15_1847475	39	NBC also at the last minute renewed its long-running comedy '' Scrubs , '' leaving it on Thursday night .
2007_05_15_1847475	40	That meant NBC ordered no new comedies for its fall schedule .
2007_05_15_1847475	41	Mr. Reilly said that given the competition on Thursdays , where all its comedies reside , it was safer to not introduce a new series .
2007_05_15_1847475	42	Here is the complete NBC fall schedule with the new shows in capital letters : Monday 8 p.m. Deal or No Deal 9 p.m. Heroes 10 p.m. JOURNEYMAN Tuesday 8 p.m. .
2007_05_15_1847475	43	The Biggest Loser ( new day ) 9 p.m. CHUCK 10 p.m. Law & Order : SVU Wednesday 8 p.m. Deal or No Deal 9 p.m. .

2007_05_15_1847476	0	The first thing that gets you is the noise .
2007_05_15_1847476	1	Physics , after all , is supposed to be a cerebral pursuit .
2007_05_15_1847476	2	But this cavern almost measureless to the eye , stuffed as it is with an Eiffel Tower 's worth of metal , eight-story wheels of gold fan-shape boxes , thousands of miles of wire and fat ductlike coils , echoes with the shriek of power tools , the whine of pumps and cranes , beeps and clanks from wrenches , hammers , screwdrivers and the occasional falling bolt .
2007_05_15_1847476	3	It seems no place for the studious .
2007_05_15_1847476	4	The physicists , wearing hardhats , kneepads and safety harnesses , are scrambling like Spiderman over this assembly , appropriately named Atlas , ducking under waterfalls of cables and tubes and crawling into hidden room-size cavities stuffed with electronics .
2007_05_15_1847476	5	They are getting ready to see the universe born again .
2007_05_15_1847476	6	Again and again and again -- 30 million times a second , in fact .
2007_05_15_1847476	7	Starting sometime next summer if all goes to plan , subatomic particles will begin shooting around a 17-mile underground ring stretching from the European Center for Nuclear Research , or Cern , near Geneva , into France and back again -- luckily without having to submit to customs inspections .
2007_05_15_1847476	8	Crashing together in the bowels of Atlas and similar contraptions spaced around the ring , the particles will produce tiny fireballs of primordial energy , recreating conditions that last prevailed when the universe was less than a trillionth of a second old .
2007_05_15_1847476	9	Whatever forms of matter and whatever laws and forces held sway Back Then -- relics not seen in this part of space since the universe cooled 14 billion years ago -- will spring fleetingly to life , over and over again in all their possible variations , as if the universe were enacting its own version of the '' Groundhog Day '' movie .
2007_05_15_1847476	10	If all goes well , they will leave their footprints in mountains of hardware and computer memory . ''
2007_05_15_1847476	11	We are now on the endgame , '' said Lyn Evans , of Cern , who has been in charge of the Large Hadron Collider , as it is called , since its inception .
2007_05_15_1847476	12	Call it the Hubble Telescope of Inner Space .
2007_05_15_1847476	13	Everything about the collider sounds , well , large -- from the 14 trillion electron volts of energy with which it will smash together protons , its cast of thousands and the $ 8 billion it cost to build , to the 128 tons of liquid helium needed to cool the superconducting magnets that keep the particles whizzing around their track and the three million DVDs worth of data it will spew forth every year .
2007_05_15_1847476	14	The day it turns on will be a moment of truth for Cern , which has spent 13 years building the collider , and for the world 's physicists , who have staked their credibility and their careers , not to mention all those billions of dollars , on the conviction that they are within touching distance of fundamental discoveries about the universe .
2007_05_15_1847476	15	If they fail to see something new , experts agree , it could be a long time , if ever , before giant particle accelerators are built on Earth again , ringing down the curtain on at least one aspect of the age-old quest to understand what the world is made of and how it works . ''
2007_05_15_1847476	16	If you see nothing , '' said a Cern physicist , John Ellis , '' in some sense then , we theorists have been talking rubbish for the last 35 years . ''
2007_05_15_1847476	17	Fabiola Gianotti , a Cern physicist and the deputy spokeswoman for the team that built the Atlas , said , '' Something must happen . ''
2007_05_15_1847476	18	The accelerator , Dr. Gianotti explained , would take physics into a realm of energy and time where the current reigning theories simply do not apply , corresponding to an era when cosmologists think that the universe was still differentiating itself , evolving from a primordial blandness and endless potential into the forces and particles that constitute modern reality .
2007_05_15_1847476	19	She listed possible discoveries like a mysterious particle called the Higgs that is thought to endow other particles with mass , new forms of matter that explain the mysterious dark matter waddling the cosmos and even new dimensions of spacetime . ''
2007_05_15_1847476	20	For me , '' Dr. Gianotti said , '' it would be a dream if , finally , in a couple of years in a laboratory we are going to produce the particle responsible for 25 percent of the universe . ''
2007_05_15_1847476	21	Halfway around the ring stood her rival of sorts , Jim Virdee from Imperial College London , wearing a hardhat at the bottom of another huge cavern .
2007_05_15_1847476	22	Dr. Virdee is the spokesman , which is physics-speak for leader , of another team , some 2,500 strong , with another giant detector , the poetically named Compact Muon Detector , which was looming over his shoulder like a giant cannon .
2007_05_15_1847476	23	The prospect of discovery , Dr. Virdee said , is what sustained him and his colleagues over the 16 years it took to develop their machine .
2007_05_15_1847476	24	Without such detectors , he said , '' this field which began with Newton just stops . '' ''
2007_05_15_1847476	25	When we started , we did not know how to do this experiment and did not know if it would work , '' he said . ''
2007_05_15_1847476	26	Twenty-five hundred scientists can work together .
2007_05_15_1847476	27	Our judge is not God or governments , but nature .
2007_05_15_1847476	28	If we make a mistake , nature will not hesitate to punish us . ''
2007_05_15_1847476	29	Game of Cosmic Leapfrog The advent of the Cern collider also cements a shift in the balance of physics power away from American dominance that began in 1993 , when Congress canceled the Superconducting Supercollider , a monster machine under construction in Waxahachie , Tex. .
2007_05_15_1847476	30	The supercollider , the most powerful ever envisioned , would have sped protons around a 54-mile racetrack before slamming them together with 40 trillion electron volts .
2007_05_15_1847476	31	For decades before that , physicists in the United States and Europe had leapfrogged one another with bigger , more expensive and , inevitably , fewer of these machines , which get their magic from Einstein 's equation of mass and energy .
2007_05_15_1847476	32	The more energy that these machines can pack into their little fireballs , the farther back in time they can go , closer and closer to the Big Bang , the smaller and smaller things they can see.Recalling those times , Dr. Evans said : '' There was a nice equilibrium across the Atlantic .
2007_05_15_1847476	33	People used to come and go . ''
2007_05_15_1847476	34	Now , Dr. Evans said , '' The center of gravity has moved to Cern . ''
2007_05_15_1847476	35	The most powerful accelerator now operating is the trillion-electron volt Tevatron , colliding protons and their antimatter opposites , antiprotons , at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia , Ill. .
2007_05_15_1847476	36	But it is scheduled to shut down by 2010 , Cern was born amid vineyards and farmland in the countryside outside Geneva in 1954 out of the rubble of postwar Europe .
2007_05_15_1847476	37	It had a twofold mission of rebuilding European science and of having European countries work together .
2007_05_15_1847476	38	Today , it has 20 countries as members .
2007_05_15_1847476	39	Yearly contributions are determined according to members ' domestic economies , and a result is a stable annual budget of about a billion Swiss francs .
2007_05_15_1847476	40	The vineyards and cows are still there , but so are strip malls and shopping centers .
2007_05_15_1847476	41	It was here that the World Wide Web was born in the early 1990s , but the director-general of Cern , Robert Aymar , joked that the lab 's greatest fame was as a locus of conspiracy in the novel '' Angels and Demons , '' by the author of '' The DaVinci Code , '' Dan Brown .
2007_05_15_1847476	42	The lab came into its own scientifically in the early '80s , when Carlo Rubbia and Simon van der Meer won the Nobel Prize by colliding protons and antiprotons there to produce the particles known as the W and Z bosons , which are responsible for the so-called weak nuclear force that causes some radioactive decays .
2007_05_15_1847476	43	Bosons are bits of energy , or quanta , that , according to the weird house rules of the subatomic world , transmit forces as they are tossed back and forth in a sort of game of catch between matter particles .
2007_05_15_1847476	44	The W 's and Z 's are closely related to photons , which transmit electromagnetic forces , or light .
2007_05_15_1847476	45	The lab followed up that triumph by building a 17-mile-long ring , the Large Electron-Positron collider , or Lep , to manufacture W and Z particles for further study .
2007_05_15_1847476	46	Meanwhile , the United States abandoned plans for an accelerator named Isabelle to leapfrog to the giant supercollider in Texas .
2007_05_15_1847476	47	Even before that supercollider was canceled , in 1993 , however , Cern physicists had been mulling building their own giant proton collider in the Lep tunnel .
2007_05_15_1847476	48	In 1994 , after the supercollider collapse gave its own collider a clear field , the Cern governing council gave its approval .
2007_05_15_1847476	49	The United States eventually agreed to chip in $ 531 million for the project .
2007_05_15_1847476	50	Cernalso arranged to borrow about $ 400 million from the European Investment Bank .
2007_05_15_1847476	51	Even so , there was a crisis in 2001 when the project was found to be 18 percent over budget , necessitating cutting other programs at the lab .
2007_05_15_1847476	52	The collider 's name comes from the word hadron , which denotes subatomic particles like protons and neutrons that feel the '' strong '' nuclear force that binds atomic nuclei .
2007_05_15_1847476	53	Whether the Europeans would have gone ahead if the United States had still been in the game depends on whom you ask .
2007_05_15_1847476	54	Dr. Aymar , who was not there in the '90s , said there was no guarantee then that the United States would succeed even if it did proceed . ''
2007_05_15_1847476	55	Certainly in Europe the situation of Cern is such that we appreciate competition , '' he said . ''
2007_05_15_1847476	56	But we assume we are the leader and we have all intention to remain the leader .
2007_05_15_1847476	57	And we 'll do everything which is needed to remain the leader . ''
2007_05_15_1847476	58	To match the American machine , however , the Europeans , with a much smaller tunnel -- 17 miles instead of 54 -- had to adopt a riskier design , in particular by doubling the strength of their magnets . ''
2007_05_15_1847476	59	In this business , society is prepared to support particle physics at a certain level , '' Dr. Evans saids . ''
2007_05_15_1847476	60	If you want society to accept this work which is not cheap , you have to be really innovative . ''
2007_05_15_1847476	61	Cocktail Party Physics The payoff for this investment , physicists say , could be a new understanding of one of the most fundamental of aspects of reality , namely the nature of mass .
2007_05_15_1847476	62	This is where the shadowy particle known as the Higgs boson , a k a the God particle , comes in .
2007_05_15_1847476	63	In the Standard Model , a suite of equations describing all the forces but gravity , which has held sway as the law of the cosmos for the last 35 years , elementary particles are born in the Big Bang without mass , sort of like Adam and Eve being born without sin .
2007_05_15_1847476	64	Some of them ( the particles , that is ) acquire their heft , so the story goes , by wading through a sort of molasses that pervades all of space .
2007_05_15_1847476	65	The Higgs process , named after Peter Higgs , a Scottish physicist who first showed how this could work in 1964 , has been compared to a cocktail party where particles gather their masses by interaction .
2007_05_15_1847476	66	The more they interact , the more mass they gain .
2007_05_15_1847476	67	The Higgs idea is crucial to a theory that electromagnetism and the weak force are separate manifestations of a single so-called electroweak force .
2007_05_15_1847476	68	It shows how the massless bits of light called photons could be long-lost brothers to the heavy W and Z bosons , which would gain large masses from such cocktail party interactions as the universe cooled .
2007_05_15_1847476	69	The confirmation of the theory by the Nobel-winning work at Cern 20 years ago ignited hopes among physicists that they could eventually unite the rest of the forces of nature .
2007_05_15_1847476	70	Moreover , Higgs-like fields have been proposed as the source of an enormous burst of expansion , known as inflation , early in the universe , and , possibly , as the secret of the dark energy that now seems to be speeding up the expansion of the universe .
2007_05_15_1847476	71	So it is important to know whether the theory works and , if not , to find out what does endow the universe with mass .
2007_05_15_1847476	72	But nobody has ever seen a Higgs boson , the particle that personifies this molasses .
2007_05_15_1847476	73	It should be producible in particle accelerators , but nature has given confusing clues about where to look for it .
2007_05_15_1847476	74	Measurements of other exotic particles suggest that the Higgs 's mass should be around 90 billion electron volts , the unit of choice in particle physics .
2007_05_15_1847476	75	But other results , from the Lep collider here before it shut down in 2000 , indicate that the Higgs must weigh more than 114 billion electron volts .
2007_05_15_1847476	76	By comparison , an electron is half a million electron volts , and a proton is about 2,000 times heavier . ''
2007_05_15_1847476	77	We 've nearly ruled out the Standard Model , if you want to say it that way , '' said John Conway , a Fermilab physicist .
2007_05_15_1847476	78	The new collider was specifically designed to hunt for the Higgs particle , which is key both to the Standard Model and to any greater theory that would supersede it .
2007_05_15_1847476	79	Theorists say the Higgs or something like it has to show up simply because the Standard Model breaks down and goes kerflooey at energies exceeding one trillion electron volts .
2007_05_15_1847476	80	If you try to predict what happens when two particles collide , it gives nonsense , explained Dr. Ellis of Cern , a senior theorist with the long white hair and a bushy beard to prove it . ''
2007_05_15_1847476	81	There is either a violation of probability or some new physics , '' Dr. Ellis said .
2007_05_15_1847476	82	Nima Arkani-Hamed of Harvard said he would bet a year 's salary on the Higgs . ''
2007_05_15_1847476	83	If the Higgs or something like it does n't exist , '' Dr. Arkani-Hamed said , '' then some very basic things like quantum mechanics are wrong . ''
2007_05_15_1847476	84	A result , Dr. Gianotti said , is '' either we find the Higgs boson , or some stranger phenomenon must happen . ''
2007_05_15_1847476	85	Nightmares If the Cern experimenters find the Higgs , Nobel Prizes will flow like water .
2007_05_15_1847476	86	But just finding the elusive particle will not be enough to satisfy the theorists , who profess to be haunted by a much deeper problem , namely why the putative particle is not millions of times heavier than it appears to be .
2007_05_15_1847476	87	When they try to calculate the mass of the Higgs particle using the Standard Model and quantum mechanics , they get what Dr. Ellis called '' a very infinite answer . ''
2007_05_15_1847476	88	Rather than a trillion electron volts or so , quantum effects push the mass all the way up to 10 quadrillion trillion electron volts , known as the Planck energy , where gravity and the other particle forces are equal .
2007_05_15_1847476	89	The culprit is quantum weirdness , one principle of which is that anything that is not forbidden will happen .
2007_05_15_1847476	90	That means the Higgs calculation must include the effects of its interactions with all other known particles , including so-called virtual particles that can wink in and out of existence , which shift its mass off the scale .
2007_05_15_1847476	91	As a result , if the Standard Model is valid for all energies , said Joe Lykken , a Fermilab theorist , '' then you are in deep doodoo trying to explain why the Higgs mass is n't a quadrillion times bigger than it needs to be . ''
2007_05_15_1847476	92	Another way to put it is to ask why gravity is so much weaker than the other forces -- the theory wants them all to be equal .
2007_05_15_1847476	93	Theorists can rig their calculations to have the numbers come out right , but it feels like cheating . ''
2007_05_15_1847476	94	What we have to do to equations is crazy , '' Dr. Arkani-Hamed said .
2007_05_15_1847476	95	One solution that has been proposed is a new principle of nature called supersymmetry that , if true , would be a bonanza for the Cern collider .
2007_05_15_1847476	96	It posits a relation between the particles of matter like electrons and quarks and particles that transmit forces like photons and the W boson .
2007_05_15_1847476	97	For each particle in one category , there is an as-yet-undiscovered superpartner in the other category . ''
2007_05_15_1847476	98	Supersymmetry doubles the world , '' Dr. Arkani-Hamed said .
2007_05_15_1847476	99	These superpartners cancel out all the quantum effects that make the Higgs mass skyrocket . ''
2007_05_15_1847476	100	Supersymmetry is the only known way to manage this , '' Dr. Lykken said .
2007_05_15_1847476	101	Because Higgs bosons are expected to be produced very rarely , it could take at least a year or more for physicists to confirm their discovery at the collider .
2007_05_15_1847476	102	But some supersymmetric particles , if they exist , should be produced abundantly and could thus pop out of the data much sooner . ''
2007_05_15_1847476	103	Suppose a gluino exists at 300 billion electron volts , '' Dr. Arkani-Hamed said , referring to a putative superpartner . ''
2007_05_15_1847476	104	We could know the first day if they exist . ''
2007_05_15_1847476	105	For several years , supersymmetry has been a sort of best bet to be the next step beyond the Standard Model , which is undefeated in experiments but has enormous gaps .
2007_05_15_1847476	106	The Standard Model does not include gravity or explain why , for example , the universe is matter instead of antimatter or even why particles have the masses they do .
2007_05_15_1847476	107	In the end , Michelangelo Mangano , a theorist at Cern , said , '' The standard model prediction ca n't be the end of the story . ''
2007_05_15_1847476	108	Supersymmetry also fixes a glitch in the age-old dream of explaining all the forces of nature as manifestations of one primordial force .
2007_05_15_1847476	109	It predicts that at a high enough energy , all the forces -- electromagnetic , strong and weak -- have identical strengths . ''
2007_05_15_1847476	110	If supersymmetry is right , unification works , '' Dr. Ellis said .
2007_05_15_1847476	111	But there is no direct evidence for any of the thousands of versions of supersymmetry that have been proposed .
2007_05_15_1847476	112	Indeed , many theorists are troubled that its effects have not already shown up in precision measurements at accelerators . ''
2007_05_15_1847476	113	It does n't smell good , '' Dr. Arkani-Hamed said .
2007_05_15_1847476	114	Physicists say the best indirect evidence for supersymmetry comes from the skies , where the galaxies have been found to be swaddled by clouds of invisible dark matter , presumably unknown particles left over from the Big Bang . ''
2007_05_15_1847476	115	Dark matter is a very physical argument . ''
2007_05_15_1847476	116	Dr. Ellis said . ''
2007_05_15_1847476	117	If you take astrophysics seriously , there has to be some unseen stuff out there . ''
2007_05_15_1847476	118	On the menu of discoveries , there is always None of the Above .
2007_05_15_1847476	119	As Dr. Gianotti put it : '' Nature has chosen another solution .
2007_05_15_1847476	120	This will be great . ''
2007_05_15_1847476	121	There are indeed other potential solutions that go by the name of Technicolor or the Little Higgs .
2007_05_15_1847476	122	But what if the collider sees nothing ?
2007_05_15_1847476	123	That , Dr. Ellis said , would be interesting for the theorists , who would have to retool and try to think even deeper thoughts about quantum mechanics and relativity , but bad for the experimentalists .
2007_05_15_1847476	124	Without any results , they would be unlikely to obtain financing for the next big machine planned , the $ 7 billion International Linear Collider .
2007_05_15_1847476	125	A worse nightmare , several theorists said , would be seeing just the Higgs , but nothing else .
2007_05_15_1847476	126	That would leave them where they are , stuck in the Standard Model , with no answer to their embarrassing fine-tuning problem , no dark matter and no clue to a better theory .
2007_05_15_1847476	127	To add to the confusion , according to the Standard Model , the Higgs can have only a limited range of masses without severe damage to the universe .
2007_05_15_1847476	128	If it is too light , the universe will decay .
2007_05_15_1847476	129	If it is too heavy , the universe would have blown up already .
2007_05_15_1847476	130	According to Dr. Ellis , there is a magic value between 160 billion and 180 billion electron volts that would ensure a stable universe and require no new physics at all .
2007_05_15_1847476	131	But that would leave theorists with nothing more to do and a world in which basic questions would remain forever unanswered .
2007_05_15_1847476	132	Dr. Ellis said , '' I ca n't believe God would push the button on a theory like that . ''
2007_05_15_1847476	133	But , he conceded , '' For the I.L.C. , a boring Higgs is better than nothing . ''
2007_05_15_1847476	134	Sunken Cathedrals There was more than birds singing and trees blooming outside the main Cern cafeteria in March to suggest that springtime for physics was approaching .
2007_05_15_1847476	135	Some 300 feet beneath the warming grass , the magnets that are the guts of the collider , thick as tree trunks , long as boxcars , weighing in at 35 tons apiece , were strung together like an endless train stretching away into the dim lamplight and around a gentle curve .
2007_05_15_1847476	136	A technician on his way to a far sector of the collider ring bicycled past . ''
2007_05_15_1847476	137	When you fold in the technology combined with the scale , '' said Peter Limon , a Fermilab physicist on duty here , '' I do n't think anything on Earth or in space that we know about beats it . ''
2007_05_15_1847476	138	Running through the core of this train , surrounded by magnets and cold , were two vacuum pipes , one for protons going clockwise , the other counterclockwise .
2007_05_15_1847476	139	Traveling in tight bunches along the twin beams , the protons will cross each other at four points around the ring , 30 million times a second .
2007_05_15_1847476	140	During each of these violent crossings , physicists expect that about 20 protons , or the parts thereof -- quarks or gluons -- will actually collide and spit fire .
2007_05_15_1847476	141	It is in vast caverns at those intersection points that the knee-padded and hardhatted physicists are assembling their detector , or '' sunken cathedrals '' in the words of a Cern theorist , Alvaro de Rujula , to capture the holy fire.Two of the detectors are specialized .
2007_05_15_1847476	142	One , called Alice and led by Jurgen Schukraft of Cern , is designed to study a sort of primordial fluid , called a quark-gluon plasma , that is created when the collider smashes together lead nuclei .
2007_05_15_1847476	143	The other , LHCb , is led by Tatsuya Nakada of Cern and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne .
2007_05_15_1847476	144	It is designed to hunt for subtle differences in matter and antimatter that could help explain how the universe , which was presumably born with equal amounts of both , came to be dominated by matter .
2007_05_15_1847476	145	The other two , the aforementioned Atlas and Compact Muon Solenoid , or C.M.S. for short , are the designated rival workhorses of the collider , designed expressly to capture and measure every last spray of particle and spark of energy from the proton collisions .
2007_05_15_1847476	146	The rivals represent complementary strategies for hunting the Higgs particle , which is expected to disintegrate into a spray of lesser particles .
2007_05_15_1847476	147	Exactly which particles depends on how massive the Higgs really is .
2007_05_15_1847476	148	One telltale signature of the Higgs and other subatomic cataclysms is a negatively charged particle known as a muon , a sort of heavy electron that comes flying out at nearly the speed of light .
2007_05_15_1847476	149	Physicists measure muon momentum by seeing how much their paths bend in a magnetic field .
2007_05_15_1847476	150	It is the need to have magnets strong enough and large enough to produce measurable bending , physicists say , that determines the gigantic size of the detectors .
2007_05_15_1847476	151	The Compact Muon Solenoid , built by Dr. Virdee 's group , weighs 12,000 tons , the heaviest instrument ever made .
2007_05_15_1847476	152	It takes its name from a massive superconducting electromagnet that produces a powerful field running along the path of the protons .
2007_05_15_1847476	153	Conversely , the magnetic field on Atlas wraps like tape around the proton beam .
2007_05_15_1847476	154	The Atlas collaboration has been led from its start by Peter Jenni of Cern .
2007_05_15_1847476	155	At 150 feet long and 80 feet high , Atlas is bigger than its rival , but it is much lighter , about 7,000 pounds , about as much as the Eiffel Tower .
2007_05_15_1847476	156	The physicists like to joke that if you threw it in the ocean in a plastic bag it would float .
2007_05_15_1847476	157	The two detectors have much in common , including '' onion layers '' of instruments to measure different particles and the ability to cope with harsh radiation and vast amounts of data .
2007_05_15_1847476	158	Dr. Virdee compared the central C.M.S. detector , made of strips of silicon that record the passage of charged particles , to a 60-megapixel digital camera taking 40 million pictures a second . ''
2007_05_15_1847476	159	We have to time everything to the nanosecond , '' he said To manage this onslaught the teams ' computers have to perform triage , and winnow those events to a couple hundred per second .
2007_05_15_1847476	160	That is dangerous , Dr. Gianotti said , '' because we are looking for something rare . ''
2007_05_15_1847476	161	The Higgs occurs once in every trillion events , she said .
2007_05_15_1847476	162	Contending Armies The competition between Atlas and the C.M.S. is in keeping with a long tradition of having rival teams and rival detectors at big experiments to keep each other honest and to cover all the bets .
2007_05_15_1847476	163	As Dr. Mangano put it , '' If you screw it up , others are here to crucify you . ''
2007_05_15_1847476	164	At the Fermilab Tevatron , the teams , several hundred strong , are called CDF and D0 .
2007_05_15_1847476	165	In the glory years 20 years ago at Cern , they were called UA1 and UA2 .
2007_05_15_1847476	166	Over the years , as the machines have grown , so have the groups that built them , from teams to armies , 1,800 people from 34 countries for Atlas and 2,520 from 37 countries for the C.M.S. .
2007_05_15_1847476	167	The other two experiments -- Alice with 1000 scientists , and LHCb with 663 -- are only slightly smaller .
2007_05_15_1847476	168	Robert Cousins of U.C.L.A. and C.M.S. joked that he was old enough so that after 25 years in the business '' half my friends are on Atlas , the others on C.M.S. '' Dr. Jenni said all 1,800 Atlas scientists would have their names on the first papers out of the collider , adding : '' The people who work in the pit make as important a physics contribution as those who end up in front of the computers .
2007_05_15_1847476	169	This is a big step in energy .
2007_05_15_1847476	170	It 's new territory , and that 's in the end why everyone is excited . ''
2007_05_15_1847476	171	At the end of the day , Dr. Mangano said , unless there is a major problem both machines will perform . ''
2007_05_15_1847476	172	It will come down to sociology , '' he said . ''
2007_05_15_1847476	173	How quickly can they analyze the date ?
2007_05_15_1847476	174	How do you manipulate and analyze the data ?
2007_05_15_1847476	175	The process of understanding is long . ''
2007_05_15_1847476	176	There could be new phenomena , he added , new particles that theorists have not thought of .
2007_05_15_1847476	177	Dr. Mangano pointed out that it had been a long time since high-energy physicists had made a fundamental discovery .
2007_05_15_1847476	178	And back then , when Dr. Rubbia was doing his Nobel work , there were well-defined theories of what would be found .
2007_05_15_1847476	179	Now , everything will be new . ''
2007_05_15_1847476	180	There are many students who have never seen data , '' Dr. Mangano said . ''
2007_05_15_1847476	181	I do n't know how much longer we can keep going like that . ''
2007_05_15_1847476	182	What comes out of the Large Hadron Collider , he said , '' will determine the future of the field . ''
2007_05_15_1847476	183	Dr. Arkani-Hamed said the tension was keeping him awake at night . ''
2007_05_15_1847476	184	Nobody knows how this is going to go , '' he said . ''
2007_05_15_1847476	185	That 's what makes it so cool .
2007_05_15_1847476	186	The experiment itself is so spectacular . ''
2007_05_15_1847476	187	Sipping an espresso in his office , Dr. Mangano refused to consider the possibility of failure . ''
2007_05_15_1847476	188	It 's like saying suppose you drive into a tree on the way home , '' he said . ''
2007_05_15_1847476	189	Let 's hope we get home safely and we see something . ''
2007_05_15_1847476	190	Plucking at Strings What will the new Large Hadron Collider at Cern have to say about string theory , the alleged theory of everything that describes nature as composed of tiny wriggling strings ?
2007_05_15_1847476	191	String theorists hope that it will confirm supersymmetry , a notion that doubles the kinds of particles in the universe .
2007_05_15_1847476	192	and was originally invented as part of string theory .
2007_05_15_1847476	193	String theorists would be gratified by its discovery , but that would not prove their case .
2007_05_15_1847476	194	In most cases , to test string theory directly , experimenters would have to build an accelerator to boost particles to the so-called Planck energy , at which '' stringy '' effects are expected to show up , roughly 10 quadrillion trillion electron volts .
2007_05_15_1847476	195	That is a quadrillion times the energy of the new hadron collider , which will accelerate protons to energies of seven trillion electron volts before smashing them together .
2007_05_15_1847476	196	String theory 's hope for the new collider -- and it is a slim one -- rests on a long-shot variant of the theory in which gravity is not weaker than the other forces but has just been diluted by extra dimensions of space .
2007_05_15_1847476	197	In that case , the new collider could produce black holes or bounce particles into other dimensions .
2007_05_15_1847476	198	John Ellis , a Cern theorist , said that possibility , which would give physicists a chance to study string theory and quantum gravity in the lab , was '' almost too exciting to think about . ''
2007_05_15_1847476	199	DENNIS OVERBYE A Bang , a Cloud , a Delay There was a bang and then a cloud of dust . ''
2007_05_15_1847476	200	Everybody ducked , '' said Peter Limon , an American physicist who was working in a tunnel 300 feet below the Swiss-French countryside on the Large Hadron Collider at Cern .
2007_05_15_1847476	201	Oxygen sensors went off .
2007_05_15_1847476	202	Firefighters went scrambling down .
2007_05_15_1847476	203	Physicists rode the elevator up and held their breaths .
2007_05_15_1847476	204	On March 27 , physicists were testing pressure on containers called cryostats that wrap around a chain of three giant electromagnets that focus protons into hair-thin beams .
2007_05_15_1847476	205	When the dust cleared , the physicists and engineers found that the foremost of the three cryostats had ripped loose from its supports and slid about five inches like a loose sleeve along the beam line , rupturing a bellows connecting the cryostats and damaging a control box . ''
2007_05_15_1847476	206	It blew out with a loud bang , '' said Dr. Limon , who is from the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia , Ill. , where the magnet assembly had been designed .
2007_05_15_1847476	207	In designing the cryostats , he explained , Fermilab had failed to consider that some of them had three pipes going into one end but just two leaving the other .
2007_05_15_1847476	208	So when they were pressurized , there was an unbalanced force pushing along the beam line .
2007_05_15_1847476	209	Pronouncing himself dumbfounded that the sophisticated design analyses had failed to notice a simple balance of forces , the director of Fermilab , Pier Oddone , said in a message to the lab , '' We took a pratfall on the world stage . ''
2007_05_15_1847476	210	Fermilab promptly promised to repair all nine magnet assemblies , each about 80 feet long and weighing about 49 tons .
2007_05_15_1847476	211	A plan is in the works , but the accident has probably doomed hopes to fire up the collider this year to circulate a low-energy test beam .
2007_05_15_1847476	212	The collider project manager , Lyn Evans , said in an e-mail message , '' The final schedule will be published in a few weeks , but it now looks unlikely that we will be able to get colliding beams this year . ''
2007_05_15_1847476	213	Cern shuts down in the winter , when electricity costs go sky high .
2007_05_15_1847476	214	Dr. Evans said the plan is now to start up the collider in March . ''
2007_05_15_1847476	215	We count a couple of months to get to full energy , '' he said .
2007_05_15_1847476	216	DENNIS OVERBYE Correction : May 16 , 2007 , Wednesday An article in Science Times yesterday about the construction of particle detectors under parts of France and Switzerland misstated the weights of the Atlas detector and the Eiffel Tower .
2007_05_15_1847476	217	Each one weighs about 7,000 tons , not pounds .
2007_05_15_1847477	0	What Starbucks did for coffee and JetBlue did for air travel , a growing number of new hotel brands is trying to do for the overnight stay : create an experience that offers something different from the status quo , then replicate it around the globe .
2007_05_15_1847477	1	While some of these new brands are filling holes in the portfolios of major hotel companies like InterContinental , Starwood and Hyatt , others are being developed from scratch .
2007_05_15_1847477	2	Called '' branded boutiques '' or '' lifestyle hotels '' ( labels that make some hoteliers cringe ) , the goal is to combine the design sensibility and character of a boutique hotel with the marketing and operational advantages of a brand .
2007_05_15_1847477	3	Or as one hotel executive , James Anhut , of InterContinental Hotels Group , put it , '' Travelers can stay in a cool hotel and earn their Priority Club frequency points , too . ''
2007_05_15_1847477	4	InterContinental introduced its Hotel Indigo brand in Atlanta in late 2004 and has since opened others in seven more cities , including Chicago , Dallas and Scottsdale , Ariz. .
2007_05_15_1847477	5	Intended to be bright and inviting -- blue and other primary colors dominate the color palette -- every Hotel Indigo shares features like hardwood floors and bathrooms with a glass-enclosed shower .
2007_05_15_1847477	6	Each hotel 's designer had some leeway to create a localized look for the brand , albeit without straying into the exclusive feel that was rejected by some travelers during the heyday of hip hotels . ''
2007_05_15_1847477	7	We 're trying to bring boutique to a more mainstream broad audience , '' Mr. Anhut said . ''
2007_05_15_1847477	8	We kind of ` democratize design , ' if you will . ''
2007_05_15_1847477	9	Many of Hotel Indigo 's competitors are trying to accomplish the same thing , but with slightly different interpretations .
2007_05_15_1847477	10	According to the consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers , hotel companies have introduced nearly 30 brands since the beginning of 2005 , a development fueled by easy access to capital , high occupancy rates and the growing influence of younger travelers with different tastes .
2007_05_15_1847477	11	Although not all of these brands fit the same mold -- Hilton 's Waldorf-Astoria Collection , for example , is an extension of the original New York luxury hotel -- most aim to offer guests some type of '' experience , '' the buzzword cited most often .
2007_05_15_1847477	12	Bjorn Hanson , global hospitality leader for PricewaterhouseCoopers , said that experience is mostly being aimed at younger generations , with more natural materials and fabrics , food geared toward '' grazing '' rather than dining , a greater emphasis on technology and common areas that offer guests a variety of places to congregate .
2007_05_15_1847477	13	( Even when tethered to their laptops , Mr. Hanson says , younger travelers seek out social environments more than their elders . )
2007_05_15_1847477	14	Yet he emphasized that most of these new brands are not trying to emulate the social scene or urban design of Starwood 's W hotels , widely credited with pushing the industry in a more stylish direction . ''
2007_05_15_1847477	15	W kind of set the path in one way , but these new brands are attempting to make it a more populous , inclusive orientation , '' he said .
2007_05_15_1847477	16	Jim Abrahamson , a senior vice president with Hyatt Hotels , likened the atmosphere at the company 's new Hyatt Place hotels to a neighborhood cafe .
2007_05_15_1847477	17	In place of a traditional lobby and bar , Hyatt Place hotels have an area called the Gallery , which offers a coffee and wine cafe , a nook with a television and armchairs and a variety of seating options , including a communal table . ''
2007_05_15_1847477	18	We created our Gallery area to be very highly targeted to our female business travelers , '' Mr. Abrahamson said , citing Hyatt research showing that guests , although not wanting to feel like prisoners in their rooms , were often reluctant to sit alone at a bar .
2007_05_15_1847477	19	For those who do seek solitude , each guest room has what Hyatt calls the '' cozy corner , '' featuring a sectional sofa and ottoman .
2007_05_15_1847477	20	The first Hyatt Place hotel opened in Lombard , Ill. , last August and now the brand is in about 20 other locations , including Atlanta , Cincinnati , Denver and Nashville .
2007_05_15_1847477	21	Like Hotel Indigo , Hyatt Place is mostly situated in secondary cities and suburban or airport markets -- places that generally do not now offer business travelers many options .
2007_05_15_1847477	22	Both InterContinental and Hyatt have aggressive expansion plans .
2007_05_15_1847477	23	InterContinental has 40 additional Hotel Indigo locations planned , and Hyatt aims to open 120 Hyatt Place hotels by the end of the year -- all renovations of existing properties , though Hyatt plans some new construction in the future .
2007_05_15_1847477	24	Starwood , too , has new brands in the works : Aloft , which is aimed at carrying W 's feel to smaller cities and suburban markets , and Element , an extended-stay hotel based on Starwood 's Westin brand .
2007_05_15_1847477	25	Hotel Indigo , Hyatt Place and Aloft all fit into what is known in the industry as '' select service '' hotels , which means that they lack some of the amenities of a full-service hotel , like a restaurant that serves three meals a day .
2007_05_15_1847477	26	The select service hotels are generally priced lower than their full-service counterparts , with rates ranging from roughly $ 100 to $ 200 a night .
2007_05_15_1847477	27	The first Aloft hotels are being built in Lexington , Mass. ; Philadelphia ; and at San Francisco International Airport and are scheduled to open in early 2008 .
2007_05_15_1847477	28	The hotels have rooms with 91/2-foot ceilings , flat-screen TVs that can connect to a laptop , a parking lot encircled by an exercise trail and social spaces aimed at encouraging mingling . ''
2007_05_15_1847477	29	It 's all geared toward making each night satisfying and memorable versus generic or an apology , '' said Ross Klein , president of Starwood 's luxury brands group .
2007_05_15_1847477	30	The company 's Element brand has a similar goal , but will feature larger rooms with kitchens , a full fitness center and in-room office space intended for guests staying an average of five nights .
2007_05_15_1847477	31	The first Element hotel will open in Lexington , Mass. , in 2008 .
2007_05_15_1847477	32	While many of the new brands are part of larger hotel groups , some are being developed by start-ups like NYLO Hotels , which plans to open its first hotel in Plano , Tex. , in December and aims for 50 locations by 2010 .
2007_05_15_1847477	33	NYLO has many of the same ingredients as its competitors : a loftlike design ( guest rooms will have 11-foot ceilings and exposed brick walls ) ; more social spaces , including a library and a game room , and a localized style -- for example , cowhide and antlers in Texas and a more nautical look in Warwick , R.I. Industry experts say there is little doubt that travelers will welcome some new options , especially in the cities where many of these companies are building hotels . ''
2007_05_15_1847477	34	They 're all going after the same general market , '' said Mark Johnson , publisher of the blog HotelChatter.com .
2007_05_15_1847477	35	He added that better service is the real ingredient necessary to ensure a brand 's success . ''
2007_05_15_1847477	36	They ca n't just throw a 42-inch plasma TV , an iPod dock and some barely functioning WiFi into the room , launch 100 hotels and have it work , '' he said . ''
2007_05_15_1847477	37	Guests also want the service they never found at some of these boutique hotels . ''
2007_05_15_1847478	0	THE other day I asked G. Bruce Hedlund , a pilot for a major domestic airline who has about three decades in the air , when he was going to be able to retire .
2007_05_15_1847478	1	The answer came back quickly . ''
2007_05_15_1847478	2	Four years , seven months and 20 days , '' he said , adding : '' But who 's counting ? ''
2007_05_15_1847478	3	Yes , even the pilots are fed up .
2007_05_15_1847478	4	After all , they 're stuck on the plane , too , in those instances -- increasingly common -- when an aircraft is stranded on a ramp and passengers are unable to leave for 5 , 8 and even 10 hours as food and water run out and sanitary conditions deteriorate . ''
2007_05_15_1847478	5	In a situation like that , the pilot is as much trapped on the ground as you are , '' said Captain Hedlund , who recently published a book of pithy ( and funny ) aphorisms and anecdotes titled '' It 's Not Just You . ''
2007_05_15_1847478	6	There are no official numbers , but anecdotal evidence is persuasive .
2007_05_15_1847478	7	At least half a dozen of these torture fests have been well documented in the last five months , involving various airlines .
2007_05_15_1847478	8	One such incident happened on April 24 , when storms forced more than a dozen American Airlines planes to divert from Dallas and park for hours at other airports .
2007_05_15_1847478	9	One of those flights sat on a ramp in Midland , Tex. , for about 10 hours .
2007_05_15_1847478	10	These incidents used to be rare , and stranded passengers once had little option other than to complain to an airline .
2007_05_15_1847478	11	Now , those passengers are organizing , networking and going public .
2007_05_15_1847478	12	Kate Hanni , whose plane was one of several that sat on the tarmac for hours in Texas on Dec. 29 , has been organizing fellow passengers to lobby Congress to demand a bill of passenger rights .
2007_05_15_1847478	13	Ms. Hanni says the group now has 15,000 members and a new Web site , www.flyersrights.com .
2007_05_15_1847478	14	So let 's hear from some passengers on American Flight 556 , the one that sat on a ramp for 10 hours in Midland last month .
2007_05_15_1847478	15	The plane , a Boeing 757 , was packed with about 180 passengers .
2007_05_15_1847478	16	They were told the airport had no stairs to accommodate a 757 . ''
2007_05_15_1847478	17	There was almost no communication to the passengers from the pilot , '' said George Miksovsky , a sales executive .
2007_05_15_1847478	18	As the hours passed , snacks and water ran out .
2007_05_15_1847478	19	Mr. Miksovsky said the young woman in the middle seat beside him evidently anticipated a shortage of drink . ''
2007_05_15_1847478	20	That young lady ordered and drank 10 bottles of alcohol , 7 of them at one clip , '' said the amazed Mr. Miksovsky . ''
2007_05_15_1847478	21	Her boyfriend was sitting in front of her and he was very belligerent .
2007_05_15_1847478	22	At first , she was trying to calm him down .
2007_05_15_1847478	23	But after a few hours , he had to calm her down because she was polluted . ''
2007_05_15_1847478	24	Passengers on the flight say they will always remember the pizza .
2007_05_15_1847478	25	After about five hours , a flight attendant announced that '' an American executive '' had ordered pizzas to be delivered from the airport .
2007_05_15_1847478	26	Flight attendants , who , according to one passenger , had been '' missing in action most of the time , '' cut the slices into tiny pieces -- 70 in all .
2007_05_15_1847478	27	Flight attendants said that only those who '' really needed it '' should take one , a passenger said .
2007_05_15_1847478	28	People milled about in the aisle .
2007_05_15_1847478	29	Mothers shared infant formula for their babies . ''
2007_05_15_1847478	30	The toilets were up to the rim , '' said Jeff Elliott , a firefighter from Illinois who was returning from Phoenix with his wife , Ruth , with whom he runs a nutritional supplements business as a sideline . ''
2007_05_15_1847478	31	Across from us was a woman who was diabetic , and she said she was starting to see stars , '' he said . ''
2007_05_15_1847478	32	I hunted a stewardess down and said , ` We have to get this woman some food . '
2007_05_15_1847478	33	Magically , a sandwich and a glass of orange juice appeared . ''
2007_05_15_1847478	34	Deborah Oberhamer , who works for a social services agency in Phoenix , said she became so frustrated over the situation , she decided to take some action . ''
2007_05_15_1847478	35	So I went up and down the aisle and asked for everybody 's e-mail addresses , '' not knowing exactly what she might do with them , she said .
2007_05_15_1847478	36	Most passengers remained calm .
2007_05_15_1847478	37	But there were pockets of real anger .
2007_05_15_1847478	38	Some passengers had to be dissuaded from opening the emergency exit door . ''
2007_05_15_1847478	39	People were like , ` We could break a window , ' '' Ms. Oberhamer said . ''
2007_05_15_1847478	40	Somebody said , ` Let 's rush the cockpit . '
2007_05_15_1847478	41	I mean , you know .
2007_05_15_1847478	42	Jeff Biggers , a writer on a book tour , said he found it amusing how the flight attendants passed out the tiny pizza slices . ''
2007_05_15_1847478	43	It was almost religious , like communion , '' he said .
2007_05_15_1847478	44	Some hungry passengers used cellphones in unsuccessful attempts to order pizzas from outside the airport . ''
2007_05_15_1847478	45	You could see other stranded planes on the tarmac , '' he said . ''
2007_05_15_1847478	46	So I guess they got pizzas , too .
2007_05_15_1847478	47	I could just imagine the poor pizza guy in the airport rushing to churn them out . ''
2007_05_15_1847478	48	American sent all of the passengers on the flight a $ 500 voucher for future trips .
2007_05_15_1847479	0	NBC , in a slump and eager to regain its winning ways , is hoping to attract advertisers and viewers with a fall schedule that plays it safe by trying to learn from recent mistakes and build on recent strengths .
2007_05_15_1847479	1	The most notable trend in the NBC prime-time lineup for the 2007-8 season , which the network introduced yesterday , is a focus on fantasy and science fiction .
2007_05_15_1847479	2	Three of five new dramas fit that description , telling tales of time travel ( '' Journeyman '' ) , a robot-human hybrid ( '' Bionic Woman '' ) and a computer geek who unwittingly downloads spy secrets into his brain ( '' Chuck '' ) .
2007_05_15_1847479	3	The NBC presentation kicked off what is known as upfront week , when the big broadcasters offer Madison Avenue previews of their schedules before the fall season starts .
2007_05_15_1847479	4	The influence that is shaping the plans of NBC executives is '' Heroes , '' the popular drama about ordinary people with extraordinary powers .
2007_05_15_1847479	5	It was the sole bona fide hit among the more than a dozen series introduced by NBC for the 2006-7 season .
2007_05_15_1847479	6	Not only is '' Heroes '' inspiring other shows , it is serving as the seedbed for spinoffs -- online , at nbc.com , as well as on the air , in the form of six episodes of '' Heroes : Origins , '' which will allow viewers to vote and influence future plot twists .
2007_05_15_1847479	7	Fantasy and science fiction , with their elaborate , intricate and imaginative story lines , make good grist for the types of original content that appeal to the younger viewers that the networks covet , not to mention computer users . ''
2007_05_15_1847479	8	NBC is among the leaders '' in networks seeking to take advantage of technological opportunities '' in a very fragmented media landscape , '' said John Rash , senior vice president and director for media negotiations at Campbell Mithun in Minneapolis , part of the Interpublic Group of Companies .
2007_05_15_1847479	9	Mr. Rash was interviewed after attending the NBC presentation , which took place at Radio City Music Hall .
2007_05_15_1847479	10	He praised NBC 's turn toward sci-fi , calling it '' a genre that has worked well for NBC and some of its competitors . ''
2007_05_15_1847479	11	Among the hit NBC series in that vein was '' Quantum Leap , '' which was also about time travel .
2007_05_15_1847479	12	Other successful fantasy shows have included '' The Twilight Zone '' on CBS ; '' Lost '' on ABC ; '' Buffy the Vampire Slayer '' on WB and UPN ; and '' Smallville '' and '' Supernatural '' on CW .
2007_05_15_1847479	13	Indeed , the popularity of '' Lost '' in the 2004-5 season led broadcasters to bring out three additional fantasy and science fiction series for 2005-6 : '' Surface '' on NBC ; '' Invasion '' on ABC ; and '' Threshold '' on CBS .
2007_05_15_1847479	14	All , however , flopped with viewers and advertisers .
2007_05_15_1847479	15	Kevin Reilly , president for entertainment at NBC , part of the NBC Universal division of the General Electric Company , acknowledged the challenges inherent in persuading viewers to follow fantastic stories .
2007_05_15_1847479	16	In a news conference before the presentation of the schedule , Mr. Reilly played up aspects of the new series apart from their roots in science fiction .
2007_05_15_1847479	17	For instance , Mr. Reilly described '' Chuck '' as '' funny and charming . ''
2007_05_15_1847479	18	He called '' Journeyman '' a series '' with an epic romance at the center '' and praised the lead actor , Kevin McKidd , from the HBO series '' Rome , '' as '' a man 's man . ''
2007_05_15_1847479	19	Of all the new series -- there are six altogether , including a reality show , '' The Singing Bee '' -- the one gaining perhaps the most coveted spot on the NBC schedule is '' Journeyman , '' which features Mr. McKidd as a San Francisco reporter who travels through time to right wrongs in history and his personal life . ''
2007_05_15_1847479	20	Journeyman '' will inherit the 10 p.m. Monday slot after '' Heroes '' from '' Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip , '' an expensive failure from the current season that did not make it to May .
2007_05_15_1847479	21	Mr. Rash said he believed that '' Journeyman '' would '' fit well with ` Heroes , ' '' although he cautioned that it was difficult to '' get a sense of a new program '' from snippets at presentations .
2007_05_15_1847479	22	The NBC interest in time travel may reflect a subconscious wish among executives to return to the glory days when the network was No. 1 in prime-time ratings and sales of commercial time .
2007_05_15_1847479	23	It would not take a setting that long ago on the Wayback Machine to return to that era ; the NBC heyday ended when '' Friends '' and '' Frasier '' went off the air in spring 2004 .
2007_05_15_1847479	24	Since then , NBC has finished fourth among the broadcast networks in prime-time ratings , behind ABC , CBS and Fox .
2007_05_15_1847479	25	NBC will again finish fourth when the 2006-7 season ends this month .
2007_05_15_1847479	26	In fact , during some recent weeks , ratings for the NBC prime-time lineup reached the lowest levels recorded since Nielsen Media Research changed its data collection methods two decades ago .
2007_05_15_1847479	27	NBC further tapped into the nostalgic vein during the presentation when a surprise guest strode onstage at Radio City Music Hall : Jerry Seinfeld , whose hit sitcom helped the network sell record amounts of commercial time in the 1990s . ''
2007_05_15_1847479	28	Can you believe I 'm here ? ''
2007_05_15_1847479	29	an exultant Mr. Seinfeld crowed , as the audience members gave him the loudest ovation they offered during the 90-minute presentation .
2007_05_15_1847479	30	The purpose of Mr. Seinfeld 's appearance was to promote plans by NBC to show a skein of short video clips this fall about his making an animated film for DreamWorks , '' Bee Movie . ''
2007_05_15_1847479	31	Each clip is to last a minute or two , Mr. Seinfeld said , joking that he did not know whether to call them '' mini-sodes , DV-juniors or tiny-tainment . ''
2007_05_15_1847479	32	The two clips he screened drew warm responses .
2007_05_15_1847479	33	The presence of Mr. Seinfeld and his comedy shorts underlined an unusual aspect of the NBC schedule for 2007-8 : there are no new sitcoms in the works until midseason at the earliest , when one , '' The I.T. Crowd , '' may join the lineup .
2007_05_15_1847479	34	Situation comedies like '' Seinfeld , '' '' Friends , '' '' Frasier '' and '' Cheers '' were once staples of the NBC schedule , helping the network achieve hegemony with so-called Must See TV . ''
2007_05_15_1847479	35	What was most notable '' about the new lineup '' was what was n't there , '' Mr. Rash said , referring to the absence of new sitcoms . ''
2007_05_15_1847479	36	It shows how hard it is to create sitcoms for NBC and all the networks , '' he added .
2007_05_15_1847479	37	Indeed , the genre has been in decline for a couple of seasons , supplanted by reality series and dramas with comedic overtones .
2007_05_15_1847479	38	NBC , as has become traditional , was the first broadcaster to present its fall schedule during the upfront week .
2007_05_15_1847479	39	Once the presentations are finished , negotiations will begin between the networks and the agencies on the sale of billions of dollars of commercial time before the start of the 2007-8 season .
2007_05_15_1847479	40	NBC sold an estimated $ 1.9 billion worth of commercial time in the upfront market last spring , about $ 1 billion less than the network was taking in during the heyday of '' Friends '' and '' Frasier . ''
2007_05_15_1847479	41	The figure included about $ 300 million in spots sold during '' Sunday Night Football , '' which runs from September through December .
2007_05_15_1847479	42	The two other new dramas on NBC are '' Life , '' about a police detective who returns to the force after being imprisoned for a crime he did not commit , and '' Lipstick Jungle , '' about three high-achieving women in New York , created by Candace Bushnell of '' Sex and the City '' fame .
2007_05_15_1847479	43	ABC will make its presentation today , along with the Hispanic network Telemundo .
2007_05_15_1847479	44	CBS goes tomorrow , as does another major Hispanic network , Univision .
2007_05_15_1847479	45	The presentations conclude on Thursday with CW and Fox .
2007_05_15_1847480	0	William Becker , who after enduring rundown , though not particularly cheap , motel rooms on a cross-country trip in 1960 got the idea for the Motel 6 chain , charging $ 6 a night for a spare but clean room , died April 2 at his ranch outside Kingman , Ariz. .
2007_05_15_1847480	1	The cause was a heart attack , his son , Tod , said .
2007_05_15_1847480	2	He added that his father 's death had been reported only in local newspapers .
2007_05_15_1847480	3	In 1980 , Mr. Becker started the Stockmen 's Bank in Kingman , which had 43 branches in Arizona and California by the time he retired as chairman last year .
2007_05_15_1847480	4	Mr. Becker was a house painter in Santa Barbara , Calif. , when he , his wife , Joan , and their son took the monthlong road trip to upstate New York in 1960 to visit cousins at the old family farm outside of Saratoga Springs . ''
2007_05_15_1847480	5	When we got back , he called a friend , Paul Green , who was a building contractor , and proposed this idea for a budget motel , '' his son said .
2007_05_15_1847480	6	Using Mr. Green 's experience building low-cost housing and calculating ways to minimize operating costs , the partners built the first Motel 6 , in Santa Barbara , in 1962 .
2007_05_15_1847480	7	It had 54 rooms with no closets , just hanging bars and shelves ; shower stalls with rounded corners to reduce cleaning time ; and sheets that required no ironing .
2007_05_15_1847480	8	Coin-operated TV sets cost 25 cents for six hours .
2007_05_15_1847480	9	In 1968 , the partners sold what by then was a chain of 180 motels for $ 14 million .
2007_05_15_1847480	10	Today , Motel 6 is owned by Accor North America in Carrollton , Tex. , and has about 800 motels in the United States and Canada , with rates ranging from $ 35 to $ 80 a night .
2007_05_15_1847480	11	Mr. Green died in 2002 .
2007_05_15_1847480	12	William Walter Becker was born in Pasadena , Calif. , on May 18 , 1921 .
2007_05_15_1847480	13	During World War II , he served in the Navy .
2007_05_15_1847480	14	Besides his son Tod , of Kingman , Mr. Becker is survived by a daughter , Joann Sharp , of Scottsdale , Ariz. ; a brother , Don , of Santa Barbara ; seven grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren .
2007_05_15_1847480	15	His wife of 59 years , the former Joan Bolas , died in 2005 .
2007_05_15_1847480	16	Mr. Becker bought a cattle ranch 40 miles east of Kingman in 1970 .
2007_05_15_1847480	17	Ten years later , he decided to open the first branch of the Stockmen 's Bank , after the manager of what was then the only bank in town told him he would have to come back after lunch to have some stock certificates notarized .
2007_05_15_1847480	18	In January , the 43 Stockmen 's Bank branches were bought by the National Bank of Arizona .
2007_05_15_1847482	0	Dressed in ratty sport coats and dirty T-shirts , Uzbek men clutching yellow job contracts squeezed recently into packed buses heading for cities to the north in fast-urbanizing Kazakhstan and on up to Russia .
2007_05_15_1847482	1	Kazakh officials say that approximately 4,000 Uzbek migrants cross each day to the Kazakh side of this tiny frontier town .
2007_05_15_1847482	2	In recent weeks , the number of migrants has spiked sharply , border guards say , in response to the economic vitality in Kazakhstan and Russia and the worsening economic and political conditions in the rest of Central Asia .
2007_05_15_1847482	3	Russia 's Federal Migration Service estimates that up to 2.5 million Uzbeks , a million Tajiks and 800,000 Kyrgyz nationals are working legally or semi-legally in the country .
2007_05_15_1847482	4	Those numbers include seasonal workers .
2007_05_15_1847482	5	The surge of workers to the north this spring has surprised many Central Asian analysts , who say the increase in migrants in Jibek Joly is just one stream in a broader flood of immigration that is emptying whole swaths of Central Asia of young men . ''
2007_05_15_1847482	6	This is a new problem for Kazakhstan and to a lesser extent for Russia , and so they have been unsure how to deal with it , '' said Khadicha Abysheva , the director of a private agency in Shymkent , a sprawling city on Kazakhstan 's southern border , that is dedicated to campaigning on behalf of migrant workers and victims of human trafficking . ''
2007_05_15_1847482	7	When you have such a large group of migrants the question is , do you treat them as refugees , permanent immigrants or something in between , like forced migrants , '' said Muzaffar Chishti , director of the Migration Policy Institute at the New York University School of Law , who worked with Russian legislators in 1992 to draft national laws on refugees . ''
2007_05_15_1847482	8	Then it becomes a matter of what kind of rights do these people have , '' he added .
2007_05_15_1847482	9	The migrant workers are often brutally exploited , Ms. Abysheva said , describing some construction sites in Kazakhstan and Russia as '' a kind of slavery . ''
2007_05_15_1847482	10	She said workers are stripped of their identification documents , shipped from construction project to construction project without regular compensation and locked up for the night , deprived of their freedom to walk off the job .
2007_05_15_1847482	11	Baltabay Muratov , an ethnic Uzbek living in Jibek Joly who was out walking near the border crossing recently , echoed Ms. Abysheva . ''
2007_05_15_1847482	12	It 's like real slavery , '' he said , gesturing in an agitated manner . ''
2007_05_15_1847482	13	They were selling people at the market here . ''
2007_05_15_1847482	14	A mustachioed man near the parked buses , who described himself as a border broker connecting workers with distant employers , said of the migrants , '' They keep coming no matter what , and more and more of them . ''
2007_05_15_1847482	15	The man , who declined to give his name , was one of dozens of men in business attire who seemed to carefully monitor the mostly young migrants who flock here .
2007_05_15_1847482	16	Whether exploited or not , thousands of workers are abandoning southern Central Asian countries like Uzbekistan and Tajikistan every week for jobs on building sites and road paving crews , on churning factory lines and in market stalls across Kazakhstan and Russia , with potentially rippling consequences for a politically unstable region that has seen sporadic ethnic clashes in recent months .
2007_05_15_1847482	17	Migrant workers from Central Asia make a significant economic contribution to the region 's stability by sending money back home , yet the thickening flow of migrants in a region of ethnic tensions has contributed to a general unease .
2007_05_15_1847482	18	In April , ethnic Kazakhs and ethnic Chechens clashed in towns in southeastern Kazakhstan , and the region had braced for possible violence this month , the two-year anniversary of a deadly antigovernment demonstration in Andijon , Uzbekistan .
2007_05_15_1847482	19	In Russia , anti-immigrant sentiment resulted in ugly street confrontations this spring , while President Vladimir V. Putin has warned in speeches against rising ethnic chauvinism and xenophobia .
2007_05_15_1847482	20	On the Kazakh side of the towering baroque archway that straddles the Jibek Joly border crossing -- a reflection of the street 's medieval role as an artery on the old Silk Road -- Kazakh officials recently installed a tall brick fence on each side of the crossing in an attempt to carve an orderly space for passing migrants .
2007_05_15_1847482	21	The chipped sidewalks outside the fences swarm with people in various stages of transit : vegetable sellers , child beggars and a constant flow of travelers carrying bulging suitcases .
2007_05_15_1847482	22	The hundreds of cars traveling from Uzbekistan into Kazakhstan must submit to a thorough , 20-minute inspection from border guards , who poke seats and send a dog trained to detect drugs and explosives into every cranny of the car interiors .
2007_05_15_1847482	23	Until January 2003 , the border between Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan was open , with checkpoints only on major routes .
2007_05_15_1847482	24	But the increasing disparity between the oil-fueled Kazakh and Russian economies and the stagnating economies in the rest of Central Asia has produced a booming smuggling business in towns like Jibek Joly , according to government officials .
2007_05_15_1847482	25	Local newspapers report a thriving illicit trade in smuggled farm produce and electronics originating from China .
2007_05_15_1847482	26	But most of all , '' smugglers here smuggle people , '' Ms. Abysheva said .
2007_05_15_1847482	27	JIBEK JOLY JOURNAL Correction : May 16 , 2007 , Wednesday A map of Central Asia yesterday with the Jibek Joly Journal article , about the large number of Uzbek migrants who pass through the Kazakhstan border town of Jibek Joly to seek work , misidentified the country in the lower left corner , bordering Afghanistan and Turkmenistan .
2007_05_15_1847482	28	It is Iran , not Iraq .
2007_05_15_1847483	0	When President Bush spoke to the nation soon after Hurricane Katrina , he was resolute that the city would be rebuilt . ''
2007_05_15_1847483	1	We will do what it takes , '' he said .
2007_05_15_1847483	2	We -- the federal , state and city governments ; elected officials and the citizens who hire them -- have failed spectacularly .
2007_05_15_1847483	3	Homes and schools remain empty or imaginary ; evacuees and survivors wait in cramped trailers , unable to return or rebuild .
2007_05_15_1847483	4	A huge silence still hangs over the Lower Ninth Ward , a place every American should see , to witness firsthand how truckloads of promises have filled New Orleans 's vast devastation with nothing .
2007_05_15_1847483	5	That the Lower Ninth is overwhelmingly black is not irrelevant .
2007_05_15_1847483	6	African-Americans were the predominant and poorest members of this city before the storm , they bore the worst of it and have the farthest journey back to stability .
2007_05_15_1847483	7	A study issued last week by the Kaiser Family Foundation , based on interviews last fall with residents of Orleans , Jefferson , Plaquemines and St. Bernard parishes , maps the outlines of a sharp racial divide .
2007_05_15_1847483	8	In Orleans Parish , twice as many African-Americans as whites said their lives were still '' very '' or '' somewhat '' disrupted .
2007_05_15_1847483	9	Seventy-two percent of blacks said they had problems getting health care , compared with 32 percent of whites .
2007_05_15_1847483	10	Blacks were more likely to say that their financial status , physical and mental health , and job security had worsened since the storm .
2007_05_15_1847483	11	And they expressed considerably more anxiety than whites about the sturdiness of the rebuilt levees , the danger from future Katrinas and the prospect of living without enough money or health care , or a decent , affordable home .
2007_05_15_1847483	12	There was a consensus about broad categories of the recovery : solid majorities thought there had been at least some progress in restoring basic services , reopening schools and business and fixing levees .
2007_05_15_1847483	13	But in three vital areas -- rebuilding neighborhoods , controlling crime and increasing the supply of affordable housing -- most agreed that there had been no progress or '' not too much . ''
2007_05_15_1847483	14	Even with the constant trickle of bad news , you can find minimal improvements .
2007_05_15_1847483	15	Thousands of building permits have been issued .
2007_05_15_1847483	16	A crisis was recently averted when the Bush administration extended temporary housing assistance for tens of thousands of displaced families .
2007_05_15_1847483	17	Some government housing subsidies that were to expire at the end of August will continue until March 2009 .
2007_05_15_1847483	18	It is also encouraging that administration of the housing program will shift from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to the Department of Housing and Urban Development , which has always been the logical choice , given its experience in housing needy families .
2007_05_15_1847483	19	Other positive signs include the halting progress toward a workable redevelopment plan , and a recent finding that the city 's population had grown to above half of its level before the storm .
2007_05_15_1847483	20	The Kaiser survey even found signs of hope when it tested for resilience in a proud city .
2007_05_15_1847483	21	Sixty-nine percent of respondents said they were optimistic about New Orleans 's future .
2007_05_15_1847483	22	And only 11 percent said they planned to leave .
2007_05_15_1847483	23	Their faith must not be betrayed .
2007_05_15_1847483	24	Residents in the survey were keenly aware that their city 's fitful recovery would be devastated if the levees failed again .
2007_05_15_1847483	25	They put strong levees above all other priorities , including fighting crime and even basic services like electricity and water .
2007_05_15_1847483	26	And yet National Geographic has reported that an engineer has found signs that levees were poorly rebuilt and are already eroding .
2007_05_15_1847483	27	There is no room for error here .
2007_05_15_1847484	0	After years of going to their doctors in rising numbers to get annual mammograms , American women have begun skipping the procedure .
2007_05_15_1847484	1	The small , but significant decline -- reported yesterday by researchers from the National Cancer Institute -- is disturbing because it means that more women will fail to get the early detection that increases their chances of survival .
2007_05_15_1847484	2	Between 1987 and 2000 the percentage of women in the United States who reported that they had had a mammogram in the previous two years soared remarkably from 39 percent to 70 percent , outpacing the government 's own health goals .
2007_05_15_1847484	3	The new study , published in the online edition of the journal Cancer , estimates that the rate dropped to 66 percent in 2005 .
2007_05_15_1847484	4	Most astonishing , some of the largest declines were among women who have traditionally used mammography at high rates , including those with higher incomes and those ages 50 to 64 , the group most likely to benefit .
2007_05_15_1847484	5	Nobody is quite sure why .
2007_05_15_1847484	6	But the researchers and other analysts cite numerous possibilities -- an increase in the number of women without health insurance , higher co-payments for office visits , fewer places to get a mammogram , less fear of breast cancer and controversy over how well mammograms work at staving off cancer deaths .
2007_05_15_1847484	7	If women are making reasoned decisions that mammograms are not needed in their personal circumstances , the failure to get screened is of little concern .
2007_05_15_1847484	8	But those who skip mammograms because of the cost , inconvenience or simple inattention face the risk that a small tumor will remain undetected until it gets big enough to be obvious , and treatment may be harder and the risk of death higher .
2007_05_15_1847484	9	Doctors and health promotion campaigns need to ramp up their reminders of the value of regular screening , and coverage should be extended to the uninsured .
2007_05_15_1847485	0	Anybody who has been in a working courtroom knows that a real trial is a long way from '' Law & Order . ''
2007_05_15_1847485	1	But even though trials are often dry , unglamorous events , they are so vested in public interest that the founders required that they be open to the public .
2007_05_15_1847485	2	Today , the best way to give the public access is to allow court proceedings to be televised .
2007_05_15_1847485	3	New York has been among the slowest states to allow cameras in , but that could be about to change .
2007_05_15_1847485	4	New York , the media capital of the world , is one of a few states with an absolute ban on televising trials .
2007_05_15_1847485	5	Two decades ago , state lawmakers authorized a program to try cameras in trial courts .
2007_05_15_1847485	6	After 10 years of experimenting , four studies by distinguished judicial experts agreed that cameras belonged in courts in most cases .
2007_05_15_1847485	7	But the State Legislature , particularly the Democratic Assembly , has been blocking televised trials ever since .
2007_05_15_1847485	8	Now , with the backing of Gov. Eliot Spitzer , State Senator John DeFrancisco , a Republican from Syracuse , and Assemblyman Mark Weprin , a Queens Democrat , are trying again .
2007_05_15_1847485	9	Their bill , supported by many news organizations , including The New York Times , would allow the judge to decide when a trial could be televised and when to shut the cameras down .
2007_05_15_1847485	10	The bill , properly , would prohibit television coverage of jury selection , the jury , children , and sex crime victims unless the victim agrees .
2007_05_15_1847485	11	One of the main arguments against cameras in the courtroom is that they would sensationalize trials , but the reverse is probably true .
2007_05_15_1847485	12	The most sensational part of any untelevised trial in New York now is the media scrum on the courthouse steps .
2007_05_15_1847485	13	Televising trials would put legal battles in a more serious , more informative context .
2007_05_15_1847485	14	And by allowing television , with proper limits , New York and the other states still holding out would fulfill the founders ' ideal of guaranteeing the right of a public trial .

2007_05_15_1847488	1	These values are best spread globally by the time-tested measures : diplomacy , respect for other countries ' sovereign borders , abidance by such international laws as the Geneva Convention and the principle of habeas corpus , abhorrence of torture , cultural outreach , democratic example and , to handle terrorism at home , police action .

2007_05_15_1847490	1	But trying to increase the quality of teaching without de-emphasizing a focus on research is an impossible goal .
2007_05_15_1847490	2	Because good teaching takes time -- time to plan and prepare for classes , time to grade papers and exams , time to meet with students outside of class , and so on .
2007_05_15_1847490	3	I spend a lot of time teaching my students , and each moment that I spend on teaching is a moment that I 'm not spending on research .
2007_05_15_1847490	4	And unless Harvard , and other similar institutions , make a decision to decrease the emphasis placed on research , any focus on improving the quality of day-to-day teaching in the classroom is doomed to fail .

2007_05_15_1847491	1	Let me suggest the most basic , time-tested and reliable barometer for defining progress : refugees .
2007_05_15_1847491	2	While the outflow from Iraq continues , as it does to this day with some two million living abroad , the situation at home is miserable , the country chaotic and not worth living in .
2007_05_15_1847491	3	When the outflow ceases , Iraq will have stabilized , and when the outflow reverses with refugees returning home in numbers , the country is on the mend with a future .
2007_05_15_1847491	4	Iraqis are defining progress for us with their feet .

2007_05_15_1847491	13	The petition demanding American troop withdrawal is meaningless ( like those nonbinding resolutions of our own legislative geniuses ) when it includes a caveat that the withdrawal must be tied into the growth and maturity of the Iraqi security forces .

2007_05_15_1847494	0	Beginning in sixth grade and lasting several years , Claudia Vercellotti said she was sexually abused repeatedly by the chief of youth ministries for the 19-county Roman Catholic Diocese in Toledo , Ohio .
2007_05_15_1847494	1	She said she later found four others who said they were victimized by the same man , although he denied wrongdoing .
2007_05_15_1847494	2	Joelle E. Casteix said that when she went to Mater Dei High School , a private Catholic school in Santa Ana , Calif. , she started being abused by a lay teacher when she was 15 .
2007_05_15_1847494	3	He infected her with a venereal disease and got her pregnant , she said , leading to an abortion .
2007_05_15_1847494	4	Court records indicate that several other staff members -- including teachers , a counselor and a coach -- also abused students there .
2007_05_15_1847494	5	Christopher Reardon pleaded guilty to rape , molestation and pornography charges involving 24 boys he abused as the director of religious education at St. Agnes Roman Catholic Parish in Middleton , Mass. , and as a swimming coach at a camp unrelated to the church .
2007_05_15_1847494	6	The police said they found computer records intimately describing the bodies of 250 boys .
2007_05_15_1847494	7	Although hundreds of instances of sexual abuse by Catholic priests have come to light in the past several years , resulting in millions of dollars in lawsuit settlements and judgments , the problem is not limited to church clergy members . ''
2007_05_15_1847494	8	People do n't want to deal with the reality that it 's not just priests that abuse , '' said Laura A. Ahearn , executive director of Parents for Megan 's Law , a national group that fights abuse . ''
2007_05_15_1847494	9	Here on Long Island we 've had a youth minister , a church choir director and even a church soup kitchen volunteer . ''
2007_05_15_1847494	10	Across the country , experts say , complaints of sexual abuse have been lodged against a variety of church employees and volunteers , including camp counselors , seminarians , parochial school teachers , day care and health care workers and catechism instructors .
2007_05_15_1847494	11	There are also instances of nuns being accused of sexual abuse . ''
2007_05_15_1847494	12	We have 40 nuns in our database , '' said Anne Barrett Doyle , co-director of Bishop Accountability , a national group that compiles reports about sexual abuse in the church .
2007_05_15_1847494	13	The Rev. Thomas P. Doyle , who once worked at the Vatican Embassy in Washington and has since become a critic of the church on this issue , said that people are often surprised by complaints against nuns , finding that '' more difficult to deal with . ''
2007_05_15_1847494	14	The latest trial to highlight the problem of sexual abuse at the hands of church laity is pending in State Supreme Court in Nassau County , on Long Island .
2007_05_15_1847494	15	Matthew Maiello , who was the youth minister and rock Mass director at St. Raphael 's Parish in East Meadow in the 1990s , pleaded guilty in 2003 to rape and sodomy charges involving four minors and was sentenced to two years in prison .
2007_05_15_1847494	16	Two of those victims sued Mr. Maiello , the parish , its pastor and the Diocese of Rockville Centre for $ 150 million , and after a three-week civil trial that provided a rare look into sexual abuse within the Roman Catholic Church , the jury is now deliberating .
2007_05_15_1847494	17	There are no reliable statistics on the extent of the problem .
2007_05_15_1847494	18	In 2003 , the National Conference of Catholic Bishops hired the John Jay College of Criminal Justice to survey the number of sexual abuse complaints but limited the scope to complaints against priests and deacons .
2007_05_15_1847494	19	That study , which included every diocese in the United States , found 10,667 people had lodged complaints against 4,392 priests from 1950 to 2002 , although critics said many victims never filed complaints , and many complaints were not recorded by the church . ''
2007_05_15_1847494	20	There 's a paucity of hard data on this , '' said David G. Clohessy , national director of the Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests , known as Snap . ''
2007_05_15_1847494	21	It 's a huge , gaping hole , and it 's troublesome .
2007_05_15_1847494	22	We have minimized the horror . ''
2007_05_15_1847494	23	Since priests make up a minority of a church 's staff , Mr. Clohessy said , '' it 's at least plausible that as many or more nonordained people are abusers as there are priest abusers . ''
2007_05_15_1847494	24	A spokeswoman for the Roman Catholic Church in the United States , Sister Mary Ann Walsh of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops , denied that the church had played down abuses by lay employees and volunteers .
2007_05_15_1847494	25	Still , in the past several years , the church started prevention programs across the country .
2007_05_15_1847494	26	On Long Island , the Rockville Centre Diocese says that it has conducted background checks of 64,000 employees and volunteers .
2007_05_15_1847494	27	The diocese says that more than 226,000 Catholics on Long Island , including parishioners , have undergone informational training sessions in association with the abuse scandal .
2007_05_15_1847494	28	It was one of these sessions that led to Mr. Maiello 's downfall .
2007_05_15_1847494	29	After the meeting , a parishioner at St. Raphael 's spoke to a teenager there who she suspected had been abused .
2007_05_15_1847494	30	The girl confirmed the suspicion , then went to the police in Nassau County , who arrested the head of the youth ministry .
2007_05_15_1847494	31	That girl is one of the two victims suing Mr. Maiello .
2007_05_15_1847494	32	Defenders of the Catholic Church have accused the news media of highlighting sexual abuse in the church while minimizing its prevalence in other settings . ''
2007_05_15_1847494	33	Child sex abuse is a pervasive problem , '' said Frank J. Russo Jr. , the president of the New York chapter of the American Family Association , a group concerned with what it calls the breakdown of the family .
2007_05_15_1847494	34	But Charol Shakeshaft , a Hofstra University professor who in 2004 issued a report analyzing numerous studies of abuse in public schools for the federal Department of Education , said there was no data showing whether sexual abuse was more prevalent in the Catholic Church than in other areas of society . ''
2007_05_15_1847494	35	We just do n't know , '' Professor Shakeshaft said .
2007_05_15_1847494	36	A lawyer for victims of youth ministers , Jeffrey R. Anderson of St. Paul , called that area of the ministry '' a real hotbed . ''
2007_05_15_1847494	37	Ms. Vercellotti , who says she was abused as a youth in Ohio , and Ms. Casteix , of California -- both regional directors of Snap -- said that they encountered the same denial , blame and cover-up by church authorities that victims of priests had experienced .
2007_05_15_1847494	38	Ms. Vercellotti did not sue the church , but Ms. Casteix was one of 87 victims who won part of a $ 100 million settlement from the Roman Catholic Diocese of Orange County , in California .
2007_05_15_1847495	0	The financially floundering Paper Mill Playhouse announced a plan yesterday that it said would allow it to finish its season on schedule and continue operating next year .
2007_05_15_1847495	1	The plan is a mixed bag that includes administrative restructuring , a sizable bank loan and help from the government of Millburn , N.J. , where the theater is situated .
2007_05_15_1847495	2	Some of the more ambitious parts of the plan have not yet been worked out , but Kenneth Thorn , the president of the theater 's board of trustees , said he was confident that the last show of the season , '' Pirates ! ''
2007_05_15_1847495	3	would open as scheduled on June 6 .
2007_05_15_1847495	4	Until recently it was unclear whether the theater would have to close its doors for good . ''
2007_05_15_1847495	5	This plan , I think , when we finally flush it through , is going to allow us to get a balanced budget next year and to begin to lay the foundation for a longer-term financial solution for the theater , '' Mr. Thorn said . ''
2007_05_15_1847495	6	But there 's a lot of work to do . ''
2007_05_15_1847495	7	The plan includes a bank loan of between $ 2.5 million and $ 3.5 million from Investors Savings Bank , which is based in Millburn ; the loan would be guaranteed by members of the theater 's board and other local businesspeople .
2007_05_15_1847495	8	The township of Millburn will also become involved in shoring up the theater 's finances , an involvement that could possibly extend to buying the theater outright , said Mayor Daniel J. Baer .
2007_05_15_1847495	9	The plan also calls for more co-productions with other nonprofit theaters , allowing commercial theater producers to participate in Paper Mill productions , and increasing the ratio of contributed income to earned income .
2007_05_15_1847495	10	All of these steps would put the Paper Mill in line with the business practices of many other major nonprofit theaters .
2007_05_15_1847495	11	The 70-year old Paper Mill , one of the region 's top regional theaters , came close to shutting down last month when it ran up against a $ 2.8 million shortfall in the annual budget .
2007_05_15_1847495	12	That shortfall had been anticipated for months , but when a bank loan was denied in April , the theater had to scramble to stay open .
2007_05_15_1847495	13	Since then , the Paper Mill has creaked by on a week-to-week basis , kept afloat by more than a million dollars in small donations and by the healthy ticket sales of '' Seven Brides for Seven Brothers , '' a production that looked at one point as if it were not going to be presented at all .
2007_05_15_1847495	14	The show played its last performance on Sunday .
2007_05_15_1847496	0	Paul J. McNulty , the deputy attorney general whose Congressional testimony in February provided a spark that turned a smoldering issue over the firings of federal prosecutors into a raging inferno , announced his resignation on Monday .
2007_05_15_1847496	1	Mr. McNulty , the fourth and highest-ranking Justice Department official to resign since the uproar began in Congress over the dismissals of the United States attorneys , had told friends for weeks that he was planning to step aside .
2007_05_15_1847496	2	In a letter to Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales , Mr. McNulty said he would remain at the Justice Department until late summer , adding '' The financial realities of college-age children and two decades of public service lead me to a long overdue transition in my career . ''
2007_05_15_1847496	3	The departure of another senior aide at the Justice Department appeared to leave the attorney general in a somewhat more isolated position .
2007_05_15_1847496	4	But with President Bush 's support , Mr. Gonzales has so far fended off demands by Democrats and some Republicans who have called on him to resign .
2007_05_15_1847496	5	Mr. McNulty , 49 , will leave after spending more than two decades in a variety of positions at the Justice Department and on Capitol Hill .
2007_05_15_1847496	6	He was a United States attorney in Virginia before taking the deputy 's job in November 2005 .
2007_05_15_1847496	7	Mr. Gonzales said in a statement that the Justice Department '' will be losing a thoughtful and dynamic leader , '' citing Mr. McNulty 's efforts on corporate and procurement fraud issues and in creating a new legal system in Iraq .
2007_05_15_1847496	8	In a brief interview , Mr. McNulty said that his years working at the Justice Department and as a Congressional staff member had been '' extraordinarily rewarding '' and that he would soon begin looking for a legal job outside the government .
2007_05_15_1847496	9	But friends said that Mr. McNulty had long chafed in his role as second in command under Mr. Gonzales and had realized that the furor over the prosecutors had probably ended his hope to be named to a seat on a federal appeals court .
2007_05_15_1847496	10	Mr. McNulty , whose affable presence was said by friends to conceal an aggressively conservative approach to legal issues , had been shaken by the intensity of the storm over the removals and the sometimes sharp personal criticism directed at him from the White House and former Republican allies .
2007_05_15_1847496	11	At times , Mr. McNulty found himself pushed aside by D. Kyle Sampson , the former chief of staff to Mr. Gonzales , who granted Mr. Sampson wide-ranging authority , especially in personnel matters .
2007_05_15_1847496	12	Mr. McNulty blamed himself for failing to resist the dismissal plan when Mr. Sampson brought it to him in October 2006 , according to associates .
2007_05_15_1847496	13	He took one prosecutor off the removal list but acquiesced to the removal of seven others , according to Congressional aides ' accounts of his private testimony to Congress on April 27 .
2007_05_15_1847496	14	Friends of Mr. Sampson and his former deputy , Monica Goodling , were angry at Mr. McNulty 's testimony on Feb. 6 when he told the Senate Judiciary Committee that most of the United States attorneys had been removed for performance reasons .
2007_05_15_1847496	15	In testimony that even angered Mr. Gonzales , according to a Justice Department e-mail message , Mr. McNulty said that one prosecutor , H. E. Cummins III of Arkansas , had been dismissed solely to make room for J. Timothy Griffin , who had been named as the temporary successor with the backing of Karl Rove , the senior White House political adviser .
2007_05_15_1847496	16	Friends of Mr. McNulty said he had tried to be candid about what he knew of the removals .
2007_05_15_1847496	17	In his private Congressional testimony , Mr. McNulty said he did not realize until later the extensive White House involvement in Mr. Griffin 's appointment or Mr. Sampson 's nearly year-long effort to compile a list .
2007_05_15_1847496	18	White House aides complained privately that Mr. McNulty 's testimony gave Democrats a significant opening to demand more testimony from the Justice Department and presidential aides .
2007_05_15_1847496	19	Several aides said he should have been combative in defending the dismissals .
2007_05_15_1847496	20	His appearance also prompted several United States attorneys , who had until then said little about their dismissals , to question openly the motive for their removal , in part because their offices had received highly favorable performance reviews from the Justice Department .
2007_05_15_1847496	21	Senator Charles E. Schumer , Democrat of New York , who has led the Congressional investigation , said , '' It seems ironic that Paul McNulty , who at least tried to level with the committee , goes while Gonzales , who stonewalled the committee , is still in charge . ''
2007_05_15_1847496	22	Other casualties include Mr. Sampson and his deputy , Ms. Goodling , who was the Justice Department liaison aide to the White House .
2007_05_15_1847496	23	Another official who has left is William A. Battle , the Justice Department official who contacted most of the prosecutors to tell them they were being replaced .
2007_05_15_1847496	24	Correction : May 16 , 2007 , Wednesday An article yesterday about the resignation of Paul J. McNulty , the deputy United States attorney general , misstated the given name of another Justice Department official , the former director of the executive office for United States attorneys , who left his job over the department 's handling of the firings of several federal prosecutors .
2007_05_15_1847496	25	He is Michael A. Battle , not William .
2007_05_15_1847497	0	In 1998 , the Republican Party was in disarray . ''
2007_05_15_1847497	1	G.O.P. Train Careens Out of Control , '' was the headline on one George Will column .
2007_05_15_1847497	2	The folks at National Review surveyed the wreckage of the Republican Revolution and asked , '' What Went Wrong ? ''
2007_05_15_1847497	3	The Republicans were not only directionless and depressed , they had sacrificed their identity as the party of limited government .
2007_05_15_1847497	4	They 'd just passed a $ 217 billion highway bill with 1,850 pork barrel projects .
2007_05_15_1847497	5	In 1998 , the Republicans spent more money than Bill Clinton thought to ask for . ''
2007_05_15_1847497	6	Big Government Republicans , '' wailed an editorial in Investor 's Business Daily .
2007_05_15_1847497	7	By now , this should sound familiar .
2007_05_15_1847497	8	And it should be clear that while some Republicans argue that big government conservatism started under George W. Bush and that the G.O.P. was in decent shape until Bush ruined it , this is a total myth .
2007_05_15_1847497	9	In fact , it was Bush in 1999 who single-handedly ( though temporarily ) rescued the Republican Party .
2007_05_15_1847497	10	He did it not by courting Republican interest groups , but by coming up with something new .
2007_05_15_1847497	11	On July 22 , he delivered a speech in Indianapolis in which he explicitly distanced himself from Washington Republicans and laid the groundwork for compassionate conservatism .
2007_05_15_1847497	12	Today , we know the substantive problems with compassionate conservatism .
2007_05_15_1847497	13	It involved blending church and state in ways that made people on both sides uncomfortable .
2007_05_15_1847497	14	It was too small an agenda to build an entire domestic policy around .
2007_05_15_1847497	15	But as a matter of leadership , that speech was a masterstroke , and should be instructive to anybody running for president today .
2007_05_15_1847497	16	Instead of looking small by chasing the approval of midlevel power brokers , he made himself look big by defining his own agenda and making them come to him .
2007_05_15_1847497	17	Instead of enmeshing himself in the controversies that were contributing to G.O.P. decline , he gave the country something unexpected , and offered a break with the past .
2007_05_15_1847497	18	Today , Republican candidates should hunger to give that kind of speech , this time with a bigger policy agenda .
2007_05_15_1847497	19	Republicans should learn from Bush 's false dawn and create a real dawn .
2007_05_15_1847497	20	What the country needs is a candidate who can transcend current categories and give a speech laying out a human capital agenda , which offers several advantages .
2007_05_15_1847497	21	First , it 's really important .
2007_05_15_1847497	22	As Isaac Ehrlich of the State University of New York at Buffalo detailed recently , the U.S. became the richest country because in the 19th and 20th centuries it had the most schooling and the best circumstances to help people develop their own capacities .
2007_05_15_1847497	23	But this advantage is eroding .
2007_05_15_1847497	24	High school graduation rates have peaked and are sliding .
2007_05_15_1847497	25	And over the next 25 years , the Educational Testing Service reports , better educated people will leave the work force and they 'll be replaced by people with less education and worse skills .
2007_05_15_1847497	26	Second , a human capital agenda leads to policies that cut across left and right .
2007_05_15_1847497	27	At the very least , it means preserving low income-tax rates , which cause people to work harder and develop their capacities .
2007_05_15_1847497	28	It means creating high-quality preschools for children from disorganized single-parent homes .
2007_05_15_1847497	29	It means giving parents more school choice so they can take advantage of the information they now have about failing schools thanks to No Child Left Behind .
2007_05_15_1847497	30	It means increasing child tax credits to reduce economic stress on young families .
2007_05_15_1847497	31	It means encouraging marriage , the best educational institution we have .
2007_05_15_1847497	32	It means a national service program , so young people can experience the world .
2007_05_15_1847497	33	Third , politically , a human capital agenda exploits the divisions between liberal populists and independents .
2007_05_15_1847497	34	Liberal populists , about 26 percent of the country , believe in redistribution policies .
2007_05_15_1847497	35	Conservatives and independents do not .
2007_05_15_1847497	36	Liberal populists believe the global economy is so broken all the benefits of it go to the top 0.01 percent .
2007_05_15_1847497	37	Independents and conservatives observe that hard work still leads to success .
2007_05_15_1847497	38	Moderates and conservatives believe inequality is acceptable so long as there is opportunity .
2007_05_15_1847497	39	In the 1980s , Republican supply-side policies helped spur investment .
2007_05_15_1847497	40	Today , the world is awash in money .
2007_05_15_1847497	41	That 's not the problem .
2007_05_15_1847497	42	Instead the shortage is in people to invest in .
2007_05_15_1847497	43	Over the next few weeks I 'll detail some policies that might go into a human capital agenda .
2007_05_15_1847497	44	What 's needed is a candidate who will break from the G.O.P. death spiral and who will stop talking about himself .
2007_05_15_1847497	45	After the Iraq debate crescendos in September , public attention will turn domestic .
2007_05_15_1847497	46	Republicans had better have something big and growth-oriented to talk about .
2007_05_15_1847499	0	It sounds reasonable : seven paid sick days a year .
2007_05_15_1847499	1	Why should you have to lose a couple of days pay , or maybe even your job , because you had the misfortune to catch the flu ?
2007_05_15_1847499	2	And it certainly seems unreasonable to penalize an employee in good standing who misses a day or two of work to care for a child who is ill or has met with a serious accident .
2007_05_15_1847499	3	After all , this is the 21st century .
2007_05_15_1847499	4	The reality , for a surprising percentage of the U.S. population , is more like the 19th century .
2007_05_15_1847499	5	Nearly half of all full-time private sector workers in the U.S. get no paid sick days .
2007_05_15_1847499	6	If one of those workers woke up with excruciating pains in his or her chest and had to be rushed to a hospital -- well , no pay for that day .
2007_05_15_1847499	7	For many of these workers , the cost of an illness could be the loss of their job .
2007_05_15_1847499	8	The situation is ridiculous for those in the lowest quarter of U.S. wage earners .
2007_05_15_1847499	9	Nearly 80 percent of those workers -- the very ones who can least afford to lose a day 's pay -- get no paid sick days at all .
2007_05_15_1847499	10	I recently spoke with Bertha Brown , a home health aide who lives in Philadelphia and has two young daughters .
2007_05_15_1847499	11	She makes $ 7 an hour caring for people who are ill or disabled . ''
2007_05_15_1847499	12	I feed them and dress them , '' she said . ''
2007_05_15_1847499	13	And if they have to be changed , I do all that . ''
2007_05_15_1847499	14	She has worked for the better part of two decades without ever being paid for a sick day .
2007_05_15_1847499	15	And her wages are so low she ca n't afford to lose even a day 's pay . ''
2007_05_15_1847499	16	If I get sick , I work sick , '' she said . ''
2007_05_15_1847499	17	I cover my nose and my mouth with a mask to keep my clients from getting sick . ''
2007_05_15_1847499	18	Food service workers are among those least likely to get paid sick days .
2007_05_15_1847499	19	Eighty-six percent get no sick days at all .
2007_05_15_1847499	20	They show up in the restaurants coughing and sneezing and feverish , and they start preparing and serving meals .
2007_05_15_1847499	21	You wo n't see many of them wearing masks .
2007_05_15_1847499	22	There 's an effort under way to change this picture .
2007_05_15_1847499	23	A growing number of organizations and activists are lining up behind proposed federal legislation that would give most workers the right to seven paid sick days annually to take care of their medical needs or those of their families .
2007_05_15_1847499	24	The legislation , sponsored by Senator Edward Kennedy and Representative Rosa DeLauro , would require employers with 15 or more workers to provide the sick days .
2007_05_15_1847499	25	Among the organizations pushing for paid sick days is the Public Welfare Foundation in Washington , which recently approved a $ 1 million '' special initiative '' on the issue .
2007_05_15_1847499	26	Deborah Leff , the foundation 's president , noted that it 's the poorest workers who most often are forced to choose between going to work sick or losing a day 's pay , and that a disproportionate number of those workers are women -- many of them with children . ''
2007_05_15_1847499	27	At least 145 countries have paid sick days , '' said Ms. Leff . ''
2007_05_15_1847499	28	The United States is the only industrialized country lacking such a policy .
2007_05_15_1847499	29	Our goal is to change that . ''
2007_05_15_1847499	30	An overwhelming majority of Americans favor paid sick days for full-time workers .
2007_05_15_1847499	31	One poll showed that 95 percent of workers find it '' unacceptable '' for employers to deny sick days to workers .
2007_05_15_1847499	32	But the Kennedy-DeLauro legislation is facing a tough road .
2007_05_15_1847499	33	As one might imagine , the industries that would be affected are ice-cold to the idea .
2007_05_15_1847499	34	The response of Cracker Barrel Old Country Store to my inquiries on this issue is illustrative .
2007_05_15_1847499	35	A spokeswoman said in an e-mail message : '' Because employees working in the restaurants have flexible schedules , they can schedule doctors ' appointments and other appointments that sick leave and personal time are generally used for at times when they are not working . ''
2007_05_15_1847499	36	If employees need to miss a shift due to illness , there are generally many opportunities to make up that lost shift later in the week , or the next week . ''
2007_05_15_1847499	37	That is the kind of workplace policy that prompts Debra Ness , the president of the National Partnership for Women and Families , to note that '' for millions of workers , getting sick can mean the beginning of an economic disaster . ''
2007_05_15_1847499	38	Allowing a worker to recuperate from an illness , or take care of a sick child , without suffering undue economic hardship should be a matter of basic humanity and fundamental decency .
2007_05_15_1847499	39	It should not be politically controversial in a country that considers itself the most advanced on the face of the earth , and that babbles incessantly about the importance of family values .
2007_05_15_1847501	0	A dispute over a $ 264 million trust that pitted the Salvation Army against Greenpeace was settled last week .
2007_05_15_1847501	1	Under the agreement , Greenpeace will receive $ 27 million from a trust created by H. Guy Di Stefano , a businessman who died in July and left his fortune to eight charities .
2007_05_15_1847501	2	The dispute involves a trust created by Mr. Di Stefano , whose late wife , Doris , inherited United Parcel Service stock from her father , a former U.P.S. executive , and never sold it .
2007_05_15_1847501	3	The Salvation Army had opposed any distribution to Greenpeace , contending that the specific Greenpeace organization to which Mr. Di Stefano assigned his money was dissolved and that its successor was not eligible to receive the gift .
2007_05_15_1847501	4	The charities were prohibited from discussing the settlement under the terms of the accord .
2007_05_15_1847501	5	Besides Greenpeace and the Salvation Army , the charities are Direct Relief International , the Santa Barbara Hospice Foundation , the Santa Barbara Visiting Nurse Association , the American Humane Association , the Disabled American Veterans Charitable Service Trust and the World Wildlife Fund .
2007_05_15_1847501	6	Greenpeace had originally sought $ 33 million , or one-eighth of the assets in the trust .
2007_05_15_1847501	7	Its general counsel , Thomas W. Wetterer , said he could not discuss why Greenpeace was receiving less than it had sought .
2007_05_15_1847501	8	Mr. Di Stefano was born in Brooklyn and lived in California and Washington State .
2007_05_15_1847501	9	His gifts were a surprise to all the charities .
2007_05_15_1847501	10	It was the largest amount several of them had received from a single donor and will enable them to carry out new activities .
2007_05_15_1847501	11	Direct Relief is creating a fund to be drawn on that will enable it to react quickly in disasters , said Thomas Tighe , its president .
2007_05_15_1847503	0	In the first major investigation of Medicare marketing , the Oklahoma insurance commissioner has documented widespread misconduct by agents working for Humana and has ordered the company to take corrective action to protect consumers against high-pressure sales tactics .
2007_05_15_1847503	1	The commissioner , Kim Holland , said some agents had enrolled Medicare recipients in Humana products that '' they did not understand and did not want . ''
2007_05_15_1847503	2	At least 68 agents did not have the licenses needed to sell insurance in Oklahoma , Ms. Holland said Monday in an interview . ''
2007_05_15_1847503	3	Humana took advantage of a new market , but did not adequately supervise its agents , '' said Ms. Holland , who was an insurance agent for 25 years before becoming the state 's top insurance regulator in 2005 .
2007_05_15_1847503	4	Humana has made a big push to expand its Medicare business and is now the second-largest participant in the Medicare market , after the UnitedHealth Group .
2007_05_15_1847503	5	Thomas T. Noland Jr. , a senior vice president of Humana , said that people who chose its products were overwhelmingly satisfied . ''
2007_05_15_1847503	6	As the guardian of the company 's reputation , I would know if there were any problems , '' Mr. Noland said .
2007_05_15_1847503	7	In its latest financial report , Humana said its '' increased sales and marketing efforts '' had been effective .
2007_05_15_1847503	8	Enrollment in its Medicare Advantage plans totaled 1.1 million on March 31 , up 50 percent from a year earlier , and the number of people in its free-standing drug plans shot up 77 percent , to 3.5 million .
2007_05_15_1847503	9	The drug plans provide pharmacy benefits , but do not pay for doctors or hospitals .
2007_05_15_1847503	10	Of the 41 states responding to a recent survey by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners , 39 said they had received complaints about misrepresentations by insurance agents or companies in marketing Medicare-related products .
2007_05_15_1847503	11	Twenty-two states reported complaints of fraudulent activity like falsifying signatures on applications .
2007_05_15_1847503	12	Many state insurance commissioners say some insurers have used improper hard-sell tactics to persuade Medicare recipients to sign up for private health plans .
2007_05_15_1847503	13	Oklahoma is the first state to conduct a formal '' market conduct examination , '' visiting a company 's offices and reviewing its files to assess sales practices .
2007_05_15_1847503	14	Karen M. Ignagni , president of America 's Health Insurance Plans , a trade group , said her organization would adopt stricter standards to ensure that agents provided '' clear , complete and accurate information . ''
2007_05_15_1847503	15	After being reprimanded by federal auditors , WellCare Health Plans announced new compliance measures last week .
2007_05_15_1847503	16	Janet S. Trautwein , executive vice president of the National Association of Health Underwriters , which represents insurance agents and brokers , said : '' A few bad apples have been behaving unethically .
2007_05_15_1847503	17	I make no excuses for them .
2007_05_15_1847503	18	They do not reflect the behavior of the majority of agents who work with seniors . ''
2007_05_15_1847503	19	The Oklahoma Insurance Department said it had found many cases in which agents enrolled Medicare beneficiaries in Humana plans that were not in their best interests .
2007_05_15_1847503	20	In some cases , the regulators said , consumers were confused because they had dementia or other mental impairments .
2007_05_15_1847503	21	Oklahoma investigators found that some people who wanted to buy just drug coverage from Humana were instead enrolled in '' an unwanted plan , '' a comprehensive Medicare Advantage plan .
2007_05_15_1847503	22	The investigators ' report said it appeared that some agents had used '' bait-and-switch tactics to secure the initial invitation '' into the homes of Medicare beneficiaries .
2007_05_15_1847503	23	In one case in the report , a man was switched to a Humana plan from traditional Medicare .
2007_05_15_1847503	24	As a result , he lost the extra benefits that he had under a Medicare supplement policy from Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Oklahoma , and he incurred additional costs when he became ill .
2007_05_15_1847503	25	The Oklahoma Insurance Department said : '' The member had to borrow against his house to pay for these uninsured hospital and medical expenses .
2007_05_15_1847503	26	This was solely due to the failure of the agent to properly explain his existing coverage and the impact of purchasing a Medicare Advantage plan . ''
2007_05_15_1847503	27	Humana investigated numerous complaints .
2007_05_15_1847503	28	But , the report said , in many cases '' the investigation was conducted more to mitigate , justify and defend the actions of the agent and the company '' than to help consumers .
2007_05_15_1847503	29	In its report , the Oklahoma Insurance Department also made these findings : Humana gave agents a strong incentive to sell Medicare Advantage plans , typically paying a commission of $ 250 for each sale , five times as much as the commission for selling a prescription drug plan .
2007_05_15_1847503	30	Humana did not maintain a complete record of complaints from Medicare beneficiaries , as required under Oklahoma law .
2007_05_15_1847503	31	Independent agents had to complete a 16-hour training course that included three hours of '' self-study '' and four hours of telephone conference calls . ''
2007_05_15_1847503	32	This training program , '' the report said , '' did not appear to be sufficiently comprehensive to fully cover a topic as complex as Medicare and the products which these agents would be selling . ''
2007_05_15_1847504	0	The trial of Jose Padilla , the American convert to Islam charged with conspiring to support terrorism , opened Monday with federal prosecutors describing what they called a calculated plan to provide money , equipment and recruits to Al Qaeda .
2007_05_15_1847504	1	Brian K. Frazier , an assistant United States attorney , spent a good part of his opening arguments defining terms like '' terrorism support cell , '' '' jihad '' and '' mujahedeen '' for the jury of seven men and five women .
2007_05_15_1847504	2	Mr. Frazier described one of Mr. Padilla 's two co-defendants , Adham Hassoun , as a zealot who '' indoctrinated people and converted them to become Al Qaeda fighters , '' and the other , Kifah Jayyousi , as '' the money man '' who provided financing and equipment to terrorist groups overseas .
2007_05_15_1847504	3	Mr. Frazier said Mr. Padilla , who was declared an enemy combatant soon after his arrest in 2002 but was eventually moved to the criminal justice system , had gone even further , traveling to a training camp in Afghanistan . ''
2007_05_15_1847504	4	We will prove that Jose Padilla became an Al Qaeda terrorist trainee , '' Mr. Frazier said .
2007_05_15_1847504	5	Mr. Padilla was described after his arrest as an operative of Al Qaeda plotting to detonate a radioactive '' dirty bomb '' in the United States .
2007_05_15_1847504	6	But that charge does not figure in the case being tried before Judge Marcia G. Cooke of the Federal District Court here , because , the government has said , it obtained the information by questioning other terrorism suspects abroad and interrogating Mr. Padilla during his initial confinement at a military brig in South Carolina .
2007_05_15_1847504	7	Federal rules of evidence prohibit or limit the use of information obtained during such interrogations .
2007_05_15_1847504	8	Mr. Padilla 's detention without charges lasted more than three years and became a test case of President Bush 's powers in the fight against terror .
2007_05_15_1847504	9	The government transferred him to civilian custody in Miami in 2005 , just as the Supreme Court was weighing whether to take up the legality of his military detention .
2007_05_15_1847504	10	With the transfer , prosecutors added his case to those of Mr. Hassoun , a Lebanese-born Palestinian computer programmer , and Dr. Jayyousi , a Jordanian-born engineer .
2007_05_15_1847504	11	The trial is being conducted under heavy security .
2007_05_15_1847504	12	Federal marshals have been brought in from around the country to help protect the courthouse , and a bomb-sniffing dog from Rochester was outside the courtroom Monday .
2007_05_15_1847504	13	Mr. Padilla and the other defendants , dressed in dark suits and blending in with their lawyers , sat quietly through the day 's proceedings , following attentively .
2007_05_15_1847504	14	Mr. Frazier , the prosecutor , gave a history lesson of sorts , describing ethnic and religious conflicts in Lebanon , Somalia , Kosovo and Chechnya .
2007_05_15_1847504	15	He said Al Qaeda had sent recruits to those regions , using the conflicts to advance its own violent agenda .
2007_05_15_1847504	16	Al Qaeda '' needed people who were willing to fight and even kill '' for Islamic fundamentalism , he said -- people like the three defendants .
2007_05_15_1847504	17	Their '' South Florida support cell , '' he said , '' fit right into this pattern of training , equipping and deploying Islamic fighters all over the world . ''
2007_05_15_1847504	18	As evidence , he said , the jurors will see an application that Mr. Padilla filled out -- in Arabic , under an alias -- to attend a terrorist training camp .
2007_05_15_1847504	19	He said they would also hear many of the defendants ' phone conversations , thousands of which were recorded by the F.B.I. from 1993 to 2000 . ''
2007_05_15_1847504	20	The phone calls will tell the story of this case , '' Mr. Frazier said .
2007_05_15_1847504	21	Defense lawyers said their clients were merely passionate and vocal Muslims with no connection to Al Qaeda and no intent to support terrorism .
2007_05_15_1847504	22	The government 's case is politically motivated , they said , and was fueled by the nation 's dread following 9/11 . ''
2007_05_15_1847504	23	In this case , '' said Anthony Natale , a lawyer for Mr. Padilla , '' you will see how in the absence of hard evidence , a suspicion can be fueled by fear , nourished by prejudice and directed by politics into a criminal prosecution . ''
2007_05_15_1847504	24	Jeanne Baker , a lawyer for Mr. Hassoun , said the government had cherry-picked certain words and phrases from the recorded phone calls . ''
2007_05_15_1847504	25	The government really is trying to put Al Qaeda on trial in this case , '' Ms. Baker said , '' and it does n't belong in this courtroom because it has nothing to do with the true facts . ''
2007_05_15_1847504	26	She and other defense lawyers said that in fact their clients had only been trying to help Muslims who were under attack in the 1990s in places like Kosovo and Chechnya .
2007_05_15_1847504	27	In that context , Ms. Baker said , words like mujahedeen and jihad have positive connotations and nothing to do with terrorism .
2007_05_15_1847504	28	Mr. Padilla , now 36 , made his first visit to a Muslim country , Egypt , in 1998 .
2007_05_15_1847504	29	He did so only because he wanted to become an imam , said Mr. Natale , who , like the other defense lawyers , dismissed the government 's accusation of a conspiracy to '' murder , kidnap and maim '' people overseas . ''
2007_05_15_1847504	30	As you will hear clearly and without a doubt , '' he said , '' there were no victims in this case , real or imagined . ''
2007_05_15_1847504	31	Testimony will begin on Tuesday .
2007_05_15_1847504	32	The trial is expected to last at least three months .
2007_05_15_1847504	33	Correction : May 30 , 2007 , Wednesday A caption with an article on May 15 about the trial of Jose Padilla , who is charged with conspiring to support terrorism , incorrectly rendered the name of his mother , who was shown outside federal court in Miami .
2007_05_15_1847504	34	She is Estela Ortega-Lebron , not Estrela Ortega .
2007_05_15_1847504	35	The article also misstated the year of his transfer from military custody to civilian custody .
2007_05_15_1847504	36	It was 2006 , not 2005 .
2007_05_15_1847505	0	With less than a month to go before the leaders of the Group of 8 nations gather at a Baltic Sea resort in Germany for their annual summit meeting , Bono , the rock star and antipoverty campaigner who helped sweet-talk , cajole and otherwise persuade them to make commitments to double aid to Africa , says most of them have fallen behind on their promise .
2007_05_15_1847505	1	Italy , France and Germany have what the report by Bono 's advocacy group , DATA , called '' a particular crisis of credibility . ''
2007_05_15_1847505	2	Bono said in a telephone interview yesterday that their failure to increase aid has been masked behind artificially high debt-relief write-offs .
2007_05_15_1847505	3	Excluding debt relief and adjusting for inflation , DATA , which stands for Debt , AIDS , Trade , Africa , calculates that Germany 's aid to Africa has grown only 2 percent since 2004 , France 's has fallen 1 percent and Italy 's has decreased 30 percent .
2007_05_15_1847505	4	France praised the group 's detailed report in a statement , but disagreed with its exclusion of debt relief . ''
2007_05_15_1847505	5	The freeing up of resources previously dedicated to debt service allows developing countries to increase spending to reduce poverty , '' it said .
2007_05_15_1847505	6	Spokesmen for Germany and Italy in Washington said yesterday that they would reserve comment until the report is formally released at a news conference in Berlin today .
2007_05_15_1847505	7	In its country-by-country analysis of aid to Africa , DATA found that the seven wealthy nations in the G-8 -- the United States , Britain , Germany , France , Italy , Canada and Japan ( the other member is Russia ) -- have increased aid by less than half of what would be expected to reach the goal they set in 2005 to double aid to Africa by 2010 .
2007_05_15_1847505	8	Japan and Britain have increased aid enough since 2004 -- 62 percent and 40 percent , respectively -- to be on the right path to achieving the goal , DATA said .
2007_05_15_1847505	9	It said the United States had fallen behind in 2006 , but seems to have gotten back on track since the new Congress , controlled by Democrats , adopted a 2007 budget that gave President Bush even more than he requested for Africa -- at least an extra $ 1 billion , mostly to fight AIDS and malaria . ''
2007_05_15_1847505	10	We 're on a trajectory to exceed the target laid out by the president in Gleneagles , '' the Scottish golf resort where the G-8 met in 2005 , said Bobby Pittman , a special assistant to the president and senior director for African affairs at the National Security Council .
2007_05_15_1847505	11	Canada has increased aid 25 percent since 2004 , still not at a rate that would double aid by 2010 , DATA said .
2007_05_15_1847505	12	Russia , which has canceled a large amount of debt owed by African countries , did not pledge in 2005 to double its aid to Africa .
2007_05_15_1847505	13	The group 's report focuses on G-8 aid to Africa , but its findings are broadly consistent with overall patterns of giving described last month by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development , based on figures provided by 22 donor nations that are its members .
2007_05_15_1847505	14	The total aid to developing countries -- $ 104 billion -- in 2006 was 5 percent below the 2005 level , the O.E.C.D. found .
2007_05_15_1847505	15	Aid to Africa grew 23 percent , but once debt relief to Nigeria was subtracted , it rose only 2 percent .
2007_05_15_1847505	16	Richard Manning , chairman of the organization 's development assistance committee , said that he was surprised that aid to Africa other than debt relief grew so slowly -- and noted that such aid would have to rise at a faster pace to double aid to Africa by 2010 . ''
2007_05_15_1847505	17	I would have thought in the general scheme of things , donors would be putting more aid on the table , '' he said .
2007_05_15_1847505	18	The economic development organization allows donor nations to write off the full face value of debt relief to poor nations in the span of a year or two , though often only a portion of the debt would have been repaid , and only over a long period of time .
2007_05_15_1847505	19	Some wealthy nations , in addition to France , are likely to object to DATA 's decision not to count debt relief in its calculations .
2007_05_15_1847505	20	The group replies that rich nations overstate the real value of debt relief to poor countries .
2007_05_15_1847505	21	It notes that by 2010 , when aid to Africa is supposed to reach $ 50 billion a year , debt relief will have largely been accounted for and will no longer substantively bolster the amount of aid each country provides .
2007_05_15_1847505	22	Despite the tough talk in its report , Bono , who has cultivated the rich world 's leading politicians for years , expressed empathy for the laggards in Europe .
2007_05_15_1847505	23	He has already met with the German chancellor , Angela Merkel , the host for this year 's meeting , who he said is very conscious that this is a moment when the Group of 8 will be watching to see whether Germany plays a leadership role on poverty .
2007_05_15_1847505	24	Of Italy 's prime minister , Romano Prodi , Bono said : '' He 's a beautiful man , but he 's broke .
2007_05_15_1847505	25	I do n't know what to do about Italy . ''
2007_05_15_1847505	26	Bono said that President Jacques Chirac of France had spoken eloquently of the need to support Africa , though he added that France had not yet come through with the resources .
2007_05_15_1847505	27	Nicolas Sarkozy , the president-elect , has requested a meeting , '' which is very flattering , '' Bono said .
2007_05_15_1847505	28	Bono said rising political support in Britain and the United States for fighting African poverty has helped strengthen the hand of those who have sought increasing aid budgets . ''
2007_05_15_1847505	29	I want to grow the social movement , '' he said . ''
2007_05_15_1847505	30	It 's no coincidence that in the countries where churches and students are out on the streets -- that 's where the numbers are getting better . ''
2007_05_15_1847506	0	The Japanese Parliament passed a bill on Monday calling for a national referendum on amendments to the country 's pacifist Constitution .
2007_05_15_1847506	1	The government will be able to hold the referendum as early as 2010 , but experts say it may take far longer than three years to persuade voters and opposition lawmakers to back constitutional change .
2007_05_15_1847506	2	Polls show that Japanese remain split , especially on the Constitution 's Article 9 , which renounces war and forbids Japan to have a full-fledged military .
2007_05_15_1847506	3	But Parliament 's action was an important preliminary step toward rewriting the American-imposed Constitution , a goal long cherished by the governing Liberal Democratic Party and one that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has deemed central to what he calls shedding Japan 's '' postwar regime . ''
2007_05_15_1847506	4	Any amendments would have to be approved by two-thirds of both houses of Parliament and by a majority of voters in a national referendum .
2007_05_15_1847506	5	The Liberal Democrats would effectively need the approval of opposition parties , which largely want to maintain the current Constitution or have their own plans for revisions . ''
2007_05_15_1847506	6	The law will be implemented three years hence , and until then it is important to debate broadly and deeply in a calm environment , '' Mr. Abe told reporters .
2007_05_15_1847506	7	Opposition lawmakers said Mr. Abe had used the Liberal Democrats ' control of both houses to ram the legislation through with little debate .
2007_05_15_1847506	8	They also criticized the lack of a minimum turnout requirement for the referendum , which would seem to give more weight to motivated supporters of constitutional change .
2007_05_15_1847506	9	The law bans public servants , including teachers , from taking part in debates over constitutional change .
2007_05_15_1847506	10	Critics said the ban seemed intended to prevent teachers , who tend to support the current Constitution , from influencing young voters .
2007_05_15_1847506	11	Under the law , Japanese 18 and older will be allowed to cast ballots in the referendum , after a current law requiring voters in national elections to be 20 or older is revised .
2007_05_15_1847506	12	Critics are calling that a ploy to raise turnout among supporters of change , because younger Japanese are less tied to the status quo .
2007_05_15_1847506	13	In recent years , the Japanese government has passed special laws that have stretched the limits of the pacifist Constitution , for example , allowing Japanese noncombat troops to operate in Iraq .
2007_05_15_1847506	14	The government is also moving to reinterpret the Constitution to allow Japan to engage in collective self-defense with the United States .
2007_05_15_1847506	15	The United States has long backed constitutional change so that Japan can play a larger military role as part of their security alliance .
2007_05_15_1847506	16	But such moves , coupled with increasing attempts by leaders here to revise Japan 's wartime history , are likely to unsettle its Asian neighbors .
2007_05_15_1847507	0	Voters went to the polls in the Philippines on Monday to elect their senators , representatives and local officials , amid reports of election-related violence and allegations of fraud .
2007_05_15_1847507	1	The results of the elections will not be known for several days because the votes will be counted by hand , a cumbersome process during which more cheating and bloodshed are expected to occur , according to the police .
2007_05_15_1847507	2	Violence is common during elections here .
2007_05_15_1847507	3	On Monday , it ranged from the shooting of candidates and voters to grenade attacks .
2007_05_15_1847507	4	Several of these attacks took place in Mindanao , in the southern Philippines , where rivalry among local politicians is much more intense and where fraud in elections is particularly widespread .
2007_05_15_1847507	5	According to the police , 116 people have died and 121 have been wounded in election-related violence since Jan. 14 , the beginning of the campaign .
2007_05_15_1847507	6	On Monday , a grenade explosion in Mindanao killed one man and wounded two more .
2007_05_15_1847507	7	In Basilan , also in the south , a gunman strafed a school where voting was taking place , killing one person .
2007_05_15_1847507	8	In the northern province of Abra , a village official was shot and killed .
2007_05_15_1847507	9	Despite these episodes , the police described the elections as '' generally peaceful , '' although there were concerns raised by election monitors that the violence could escalate in the next few days . ''
2007_05_15_1847507	10	Over all , the situation was generally peaceful except for some untoward incidents , '' said Avelino Razon Jr. , the deputy director of the national police . ''
2007_05_15_1847507	11	The election process has been proceeding smoothly . ''
2007_05_15_1847507	12	Thousands of teachers will manually count and tabulate the ballots .
2007_05_15_1847507	13	The task is expected to continue for days .
2007_05_15_1847507	14	In past elections , the snatching of ballots and the switching of what are called election returns , on which the votes are tabulated by precinct , have been common during this process .
2007_05_15_1847507	15	In some cases , blackouts occur in precincts prior to the snatching or switching .
2007_05_15_1847507	16	The political opposition claimed that before voting began , ballot boxes containing completed election returns had been discovered in several provinces .
2007_05_15_1847507	17	Senator Aquilino Pimentel Jr. , a major opposition figure , said the election returns already had the names of administration candidates .
2007_05_15_1847507	18	The governing party denied the charge .
2007_05_15_1847507	19	Several reports , some of them coming from volunteer groups that are monitoring the conduct of the elections , indicated that frauds involved vote-buying , as well as removing names from voter rolls and removing candidates from ballots in several precincts across the country . ''
2007_05_15_1847507	20	Flying voters , '' or the busing of voters from one area to another in order to vote outside their regions , were also reported .
2007_05_15_1847507	21	The police confirmed that the number of vote-buying incidents had increased .
2007_05_15_1847507	22	In Davao City , reports indicated that some voters were paid 50 pesos to 150 pesos , or $ 1 to $ 3 , by candidates in exchange for their votes .
2007_05_15_1847507	23	Kawagib , a nongovernmental Muslim group , alleged Monday that election returns were being sold in some parts of Mindanao for as much as 60,000 pesos , or about $ 1,200 .
2007_05_15_1847507	24	Freda Guttman , a Canadian who is one of the dozens of foreign observers monitoring the polls , said Monday that her group had come across a vote-buying operation in Manila , where people lined up at a parked vehicle , reportedly to receive money .
2007_05_15_1847507	25	President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo , in a statement released after she voted in her province of Pampanga , north of Manila , said the country '' is at a crossroads as we wait for the proclamation of winners . ''
2007_05_15_1847507	26	She urged candidates to have a '' gracious heart , win or lose . ''
2007_05_15_1847507	27	President Arroyo seeks to maintain control of the Senate and the House of Representatives , which would allow her to prevent another impeachment attempt over allegations that she cheated in the 2004 elections .
2007_05_15_1847507	28	She has denied the charges .
2007_05_15_1847508	0	An American soldier was shot dead and four other Americans were wounded in Pakistan on Monday after a meeting of Afghan , Pakistani and NATO officials at the border to try to resolve recent clashes between the neighboring countries , Afghan and NATO officials said .
2007_05_15_1847508	1	The soldiers were ambushed by '' unknown assailants '' near Teri Mangal , on the Pakistani side of the border , after leaving the meeting and heading back toward Afghanistan , a statement from the NATO force in Afghanistan said .
2007_05_15_1847508	2	Two of the wounded were civilians and two were servicemen , it said .
2007_05_15_1847508	3	Teri Mangal lies less than two miles from the Afghan-Pakistani border .
2007_05_15_1847508	4	Afghan officials said the dead and wounded were Americans .
2007_05_15_1847508	5	Four Pakistani soldiers who were escorting the Afghan and NATO team were also wounded , and one later died of his wounds , Pakistani officials said .
2007_05_15_1847508	6	The military spokesman blamed '' miscreants , '' a term often used for militants in the tribal areas . ''
2007_05_15_1847508	7	Security forces have cordoned the area , and an inquiry has been ordered to ascertain the facts , '' said Maj. Gen. Waheed Arshad , the Pakistani military spokesman .
2007_05_15_1847508	8	A Pakistani official , who asked not to be named because he was not permitted to speak to the news media , said the gunman had been wearing a uniform of the local Kurram tribal militia .
2007_05_15_1847508	9	The Afghan Defense Ministry gave a conflicting account , saying that a Pakistani soldier had opened fire on the Americans at the meeting and was then shot and killed by other American soldiers .
2007_05_15_1847508	10	Two American soldiers were killed and two wounded , and several other Pakistanis and an Afghan soldier were wounded in the firing , the Defense Ministry spokesman , Gen. Zaher Azimi , said in a statement .
2007_05_15_1847508	11	Three senior Afghan officials attended the meeting : the governor of Paktia Province ; the commander of the First Division of the Afghan Army ; and the commander of the local battalion of the border police .
2007_05_15_1847508	12	The governor , Rahmatullah Rahmat , in comments to The Associated Press , said gunmen opened fire on the group as it was heading to helicopters for the return journey .
2007_05_15_1847508	13	Tensions are running high between Pakistan and Afghanistan after several clashes on the border in recent weeks .
2007_05_15_1847508	14	In a statement , the Afghan Foreign Ministry accused the Pakistani Army of an invasion , saying it entered the Zazai District in Paktia Province on Saturday and destroyed houses and public buildings .
2007_05_15_1847508	15	Pakistani gunfire in the clash on Saturday killed 13 people and wounded 28 , with police officers and civilians among the casualties , said the Afghan Foreign Ministry spokesman , Sultan Ahmed Baheen .
2007_05_15_1847508	16	The Foreign Ministry said it would summon the Pakistani ambassador on Monday to protest .
2007_05_15_1847508	17	It also sent a formal letter of protest to Ban Ki-moon , the United Nations secretary general .
2007_05_15_1847508	18	The Afghan Defense Ministry said Pakistani forces moved in Saturday morning and tried to occupy positions one to two miles inside Afghan territory .
2007_05_15_1847508	19	When they were stopped by the border police , they opened fire with artillery , General Azimi said Sunday at a news conference .
2007_05_15_1847508	20	The Pakistani spokesman , General Arshad , denied any aggressive action . ''
2007_05_15_1847508	21	Our position is very clear -- there is no question of entering into Afghan territory , and there was no such attempt made , '' he said , according to Agence France-Presse .
2007_05_15_1847508	22	Pakistan has begun building a fence along parts of the frontier between the countries , saying it wants to stem the flow of militants crossing into Afghanistan .
2007_05_15_1847508	23	But Afghanistan is opposed to the idea , saying that it will divide families and tribes that live along the border and that it will not tackle the insurgency at its source , the camps where militants are being recruited and trained inside Pakistan .
2007_05_15_1847508	24	Afghanistan has never recognized the border , which was drawn by British officials more than 100 years ago during the imperial era .
2007_05_15_1847508	25	On April 19 , Afghan soldiers tore down the first part of the fence and then engaged in a firefight with Pakistani troops .
2007_05_15_1847508	26	Meanwhile , the body of the top Taliban commander , Mullah Dadullah , who was killed in southern Afghanistan over the weekend , was buried with proper Muslim rites in Kandahar , the provincial governor , Asadullah Khaled , said Monday .
2007_05_15_1847508	27	The place of burial was being kept secret for security reasons , he said , adding that if the family of Mullah Dadullah approached the government , officials would hand over his body .
2007_05_15_1847509	0	Opposition parties shut down the southern port city of Karachi and slowed commerce in other parts of the country with a strike on Monday to protest the deaths of at least 39 people in political violence over the weekend .
2007_05_15_1847509	1	The situation in Karachi , the nation 's commercial and financial hub , was described as '' tense but under control '' on Monday by law enforcement officials .
2007_05_15_1847509	2	Thousand of paramilitary troops were called in to patrol the streets after being given the authority to '' shoot and kill '' anyone involved in more violence . ''
2007_05_15_1847509	3	The city is totally paralyzed , '' Azhar Farooqi , the Karachi police chief , was quoted as saying by Reuters . ''
2007_05_15_1847509	4	Shops are closed , and very little public transport is on the roads .
2007_05_15_1847509	5	People are scared . ''
2007_05_15_1847509	6	The strike and street clashes are one of the most serious challenges to face Gen. Pervez Musharraf , Pakistan 's president , since he took power in a bloodless coup in 1999 .
2007_05_15_1847509	7	The clashes , between government supporters and opposition parties , were set off Saturday by the arrival of Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry , the Supreme Court chief justice who was suspended by President Musharraf in March .
2007_05_15_1847509	8	Mr. Chaudhry , who has vowed to fight his removal , had come to address lawyers of the provincial bar association .
2007_05_15_1847509	9	Since Mr. Chaudhry 's suspension , lawyers incensed by what they perceived as an assault on the judiciary have staged rallies and boycotted court proceedings across the country .
2007_05_15_1847509	10	Opposition political parties have also taken up the cause .
2007_05_15_1847509	11	Adding to the tensions , a senior official of Pakistan 's Supreme Court was shot and killed by unidentified gunmen early Monday here in Islamabad , the capital .
2007_05_15_1847509	12	Syed Hammad Raza , 37 , an additional registrar of the Supreme Court , was killed under mysterious circumstances at 4:30 a.m. local time at his home , relatives and police officials said .
2007_05_15_1847509	13	Islamabad police officials speculated that the killing was tied to a robbery .
2007_05_15_1847509	14	But relatives and lawyers called it politically motivated . ''
2007_05_15_1847509	15	It was targeted killing , '' said Munir A. Malik , an aide to the chief justice . ''
2007_05_15_1847509	16	He was shot near the temple . ''
2007_05_15_1847509	17	Mr. Raza , a bureaucrat with an able reputation , was close to the suspended chief justice and was brought to Islamabad from Quetta by Mr. Chaudhry almost a year and half ago , Mr. Malik said .
2007_05_15_1847509	18	Mr. Raza '' was asked to provide evidence against the justice , but he refused , '' Mr. Malik said .
2007_05_15_1847509	19	Reuters quoted Mr. Raza 's widow , Shabana , as telling Mr. Chaudhry , '' You called him to Islamabad , you should have protected him , and now my children need protection as well . ''
2007_05_15_1847509	20	Mr. Raza left two sons and a 5-year-old daughter as well as his wife , who said she had dual Pakistani and British citizenship .
2007_05_15_1847509	21	The family left their home for Lahore on Monday afternoon .
2007_05_15_1847509	22	Mr. Chaudhry has not shied away from investigating cases that challenged the government and has taken cases involving '' forced disappearances '' -- people believed to have been taken by intelligence agencies without due process .
2007_05_15_1847509	23	In addition , Mr. Chaudhry 's previous public stances implied that the court was unlikely to favor the government in a number of politically charged cases that are likely to come before the Supreme Court soon .
2007_05_15_1847509	24	These include one challenging the legality of General Musharraf 's being allowed to hold the posts of president and army chief , and one on whether the present Parliament could re-elect him president before its term expires later this year .
2007_05_15_1847509	25	On Monday , Qazi Hussain Ahmed , the leader of Jamaat-e-Islami , a religious party , filed a petition before the Supreme Court , calling for the removal of General Musharraf on grounds that he had violated his oath by patronizing some political parties , according to Mr. Ahmed 's lawyer , Shaukat Siddiqui .
2007_05_15_1847509	26	Pakistani analysts said the expanding legal and political crisis and its handling by President Musharraf seemed to have made his position tenuous and seriously undermined his credibility . ''
2007_05_15_1847509	27	He has run into a cul-de-sac , '' said Talat Masood , a retired general and a defense and political analyst based in Islamabad .
2007_05_15_1847509	28	Anger has risen across the country over the way in which security officials stood by or vanished from the streets in Karachi as armed groups of the Muttahida Quami Movement , a pro-government political party , and opposition parties clashed with one another Saturday .
2007_05_15_1847509	29	On Monday , some 12,000 paramilitary troops were deployed in Karachi , as well as 3,000 Rangers who were called in from the interior of Sindh Province , according to Maj. Gen. Javed Zia , director general of Pakistan Rangers in Sindh .
2007_05_15_1847509	30	Still , protesters set fire to some vehicles and pelted police officers with stones in the city 's Lyari neighborhood , but were later dispersed by the police and the arrival of the Rangers , according to the local news media .
2007_05_15_1847509	31	Three people were killed in the Lyari neighborhood on Monday night as protesters clashed with law enforcement authorities , according to local news media and opposition political workers .
2007_05_15_1847509	32	Elsewhere , the strike had varying impact .
2007_05_15_1847509	33	In the eastern city of Lahore , most shopping malls were closed and public transportation was thin .
2007_05_15_1847509	34	Business activity , however , was partially restored later in the afternoon after a huge rally of lawyers and opposition political workers ended peacefully .
2007_05_15_1847509	35	Similar strikes were observed with partial success in other parts of the country .
2007_05_15_1847511	0	I GREW up in Buffalo , and my dad used to take me out to the airport to watch the planes .
2007_05_15_1847511	1	I knew then that someday I was going to learn to fly .
2007_05_15_1847511	2	I 'm a former United States Air Force captain .
2007_05_15_1847511	3	There are a lot of great things about the service , but one of the best is that you can take flying lessons pretty inexpensively with the Air Force-supervised civilian-run aero clubs on base .
2007_05_15_1847511	4	I took my first lesson in high school , but really learned to fly from these guys .
2007_05_15_1847511	5	I 'll fly commercial airlines rather than fly my own plane , a 1979 Cessna P210 Centurion , any time a flight is longer than eight hours in one day .
2007_05_15_1847511	6	Because of long delays at security and because of speed restrictions often imposed on airlines by air traffic controllers , I can beat commercial flights from my home field at Reno , Nev. , to almost any point west of the Rockies , and come pretty close to beating them to almost any destination west of the Mississippi , except Dallas and Chicago which have direct flights from Reno .
2007_05_15_1847511	7	Flying my plane is equivalent in price to flying first class .
2007_05_15_1847511	8	So if I flew first class on short hops , there is almost no difference between the cost of using my plane and the airlines .
2007_05_15_1847511	9	Reno to Seattle takes three hours and costs $ 300 in my plane .
2007_05_15_1847511	10	Flying commercial on Alaska Airlines takes a little less than two hours and costs $ 215 .
2007_05_15_1847511	11	However , the more passengers I take in my plane , the more cost efficient it becomes .
2007_05_15_1847511	12	For instance , flying my family first class from Reno to Seattle on Alaska Air would cost $ 645 , but still only costs $ 300 on my plane .
2007_05_15_1847511	13	But I do n't usually fly first class on short hops , so the airlines usually win in price , especially during price wars .
2007_05_15_1847511	14	The airlines win in all-weather capability and general reliability .
2007_05_15_1847511	15	The stress factor is obviously much lower on the airlines because I 'm not in charge of the flight .
2007_05_15_1847511	16	I feel different flying commercial than I do flying myself .
2007_05_15_1847511	17	Flying commercial is almost stress-free , even considering late arrivals , baggage and ticket hassles , dealing with other passengers and security concerns .
2007_05_15_1847511	18	And I love chatting with the crew .
2007_05_15_1847511	19	Flying the airlines leaves time to think about other things than the trip itself , so I 'm free to plan , write , socialize or do nothing .
2007_05_15_1847511	20	Being able to do some writing on a long airline flight is a real bonus , and I often make notes about things like weather , people and crew members I 've met , and situations I 've encountered while traveling .
2007_05_15_1847511	21	When a single but large and very intense thunderstorm closed all air traffic from Chicago 's O'Hare Airport , we found out later that air traffic all around the world had been disrupted .
2007_05_15_1847511	22	What if a terrorist purposely wanted to quickly create worldwide financial chaos and hold a company ransom by attacking airports ?
2007_05_15_1847511	23	That became the basis of my eighth novel , '' Storming Heaven . ''
2007_05_15_1847511	24	I remember flying into Key West , Fla. , and seeing a Patriot surface-to-air missile system set up at the airport for an air show , and wondering if we had been tracked by that Patriot missile site .
2007_05_15_1847511	25	Things like this have happened in private flying , too .
2007_05_15_1847511	26	I 've been intercepted by United States Navy , Air Force , Coast Guard and Customs Service aircraft ; and I 've flown near Disneyland during fireworks shows , with some of the rockets appearing to come awfully close .
2007_05_15_1847511	27	All of these adventures make great scenes for novels .
2007_05_15_1847511	28	Truth , it seems , can often be stranger than fiction .

2007_05_15_1847512	13	The scenario for the test is that a Boeing 747 loses control and veers off the runway on landing , suffering major structural damage and an explosion that causes many fatalities and injuries and '' widespread panic , '' the agency that operates the airport said .
2007_05_15_1847514	0	Sun worshipers coming to this Jersey Shore town should be happy that the closed beaches will soon be reopening .
2007_05_15_1847514	1	But they might want to rethink what they bring .
2007_05_15_1847514	2	Pail and small shovel : check .
2007_05_15_1847514	3	Sand spade and metal detector : skip .
2007_05_15_1847514	4	Beach umbrella : proceed with caution .
2007_05_15_1847514	5	After removing 1,111 pieces of potentially explosive military ordnance from the sand and surf , the United States Army Corps of Engineers is ready to declare the beaches here and in neighboring Ship Bottom safe and recommend that they be reopened in time for Memorial Day .
2007_05_15_1847514	6	So , once the State Department of Environmental Protection approves , the '' Beach Closed '' signs will come down .
2007_05_15_1847514	7	But in their place will be new signs prohibiting beachgoers from using metal detectors or digging deeper than a foot into the sand .
2007_05_15_1847514	8	These '' land-use controls '' will be posted at every entrance and on every lifeguard stand along the 1.4 miles of affected beach on Long Beach Island . ''
2007_05_15_1847514	9	We really do n't expect anybody to find anything , but you do n't know , '' George Follett , an explosives safety specialist for the Army Corps who has been overseeing the removal of the devices , said on Monday . ''
2007_05_15_1847514	10	If there 's a lot of wave action , something might be uncovered . ''
2007_05_15_1847514	11	Keith Watson , the project manager , said he did not expect umbrellas to pose a problem , but children digging too deep might be warned to ease off .
2007_05_15_1847514	12	The corps will be holding training sessions with all police , fire and beach personnel , and any interested citizens , about how to handle situations should they arise , Mr. Watson said . ''
2007_05_15_1847514	13	We 'll be training badge checkers and lifeguards what to look out for , '' he said , '' and when they see someone digging too far , they 'll politely tell them not to .
2007_05_15_1847514	14	It 's all part of the public relations . ''
2007_05_15_1847514	15	It is one public relations campaign that Joe Muzzillo , who owns a Surf City beach shop , could live without .
2007_05_15_1847514	16	After hearing that sand castle building and hole digging would be restricted , Mr. Muzzillo decided to skip buying any sand toys and umbrellas for his shop , Exit 63 WearHouse .
2007_05_15_1847514	17	Instead of the beach paraphernalia , the store 's back wall is now lined with T-shirts that carry slogans like '' Save a Tourist -- Find a Bomb , '' '' Surf City 's Da Bomb '' and '' I Got Bombed on L.B.I. , '' for Long Beach Island .
2007_05_15_1847514	18	Aside from a couple of complaints , reactions to the shirts have been '' 98 percent positive , '' Mr. Muzzillo said .
2007_05_15_1847514	19	Still , he 's predicting a weak summer . ''
2007_05_15_1847514	20	Even if the beach is open , I think it 's going to suffer , '' he said . ''
2007_05_15_1847514	21	If kids ca n't dig and do the normal things kids do , it could be kind of traumatic , especially when they hear the explanation for why .
2007_05_15_1847514	22	Is a kid ever going to want to dig in the sand again ? ''
2007_05_15_1847514	23	Mary Madonna , the Surf City borough clerk , said the borough has had an ordinance that prohibits digging more than 12 inches at the beach since 2002 , when a boy in nearby Loveladies died after digging a deep tunnel that collapsed on him .
2007_05_15_1847514	24	But she and others at Borough Hall could not say how strictly the law has been enforced .
2007_05_15_1847514	25	In Ship Bottom , where about 10 percent of the beaches are affected by the new guidelines , a regulation against digging deep holes also exists , but Mayor William Huelsenbeck said that there was no set depth and that enforcement was left to the discretion of lifeguards . ''
2007_05_15_1847514	26	We 've always discouraged deep holes ; nothing will change , '' Mayor Huelsenbeck said . ''
2007_05_15_1847514	27	Kids can use their shovels and pails .
2007_05_15_1847514	28	As for metal detectors , certainly we would discourage people from trying to look for these things . ''
2007_05_15_1847514	29	The explosives problem arose on March 5 when a resident using a metal detector came upon a rusted military fuze , an ignition device incorporating mechanical or electric elements , buried in the sand .
2007_05_15_1847514	30	Believed to have been dumped off the sides of ships sometime during World War I , the discarded military munitions lay on the ocean floor for 90 years or more , according to Mr. Follett .
2007_05_15_1847514	31	Last fall , the Army Corps dredged up 500,000 cubic yards of sand from the bottom of the Atlantic as part of a $ 9 million beach replenishment program for Surf City and part of Ship Bottom .
2007_05_15_1847514	32	The joy of getting new , wider beaches was quickly diminished by the discovery of the ordnance , which corps officials said could cause injury or death if detonated .
2007_05_15_1847514	33	For the past six weeks , contractors hired by the corps have been sweeping every inch of the replenished beach , using equipment that Mr. Watson and Mr. Follett said could detect devices as deep as three feet with 95 percent accuracy .
2007_05_15_1847514	34	At the start of the cleanup effort , Mr. Follett said , the contractors were finding as many as 40 to 50 devices a day .
2007_05_15_1847514	35	On Monday , doing a second sweep of the areas stirred up by the recent northeaster , the crews found one device .
2007_05_15_1847514	36	The cleanup has cost $ 2.3 million to date , according to Mr. Watson , who added that the corps might have to undertake a similar effort next winter . ''
2007_05_15_1847514	37	Beaches are a dynamic thing , '' he said . ''
2007_05_15_1847514	38	We 're not leaving .
2007_05_15_1847514	39	We 'll follow it through to the end . ''
2007_05_15_1847515	0	The Department of Education stood on the firing line last night at a contentious PTA meeting attended by more than 100 Brooklyn parents whose schools are set to share space with the Khalil Gibran International Academy , a new dual-language school that will teach Arabic language and culture .
2007_05_15_1847515	1	Parents at the Math and Science Exploratory School , a middle school , and the Brooklyn High School of the Arts complained that the Khalil Gibran school , scheduled to open at 345 Dean Street in Boerum Hill in September , would take up too much space and disrupt their programs .
2007_05_15_1847515	2	Garth Harries , chief executive of the Office of New Schools at the Education Department , fielded questions from parents , promising that the school would occupy space in the building for only two years . ''

2007_05_15_1847515	4	Where exactly is this room you all are talking about ? '' ''
2007_05_15_1847515	5	What 's the rush ? ''

2007_05_15_1847515	7	Why do we have to feel like this is being shoved down our throats ? ''
2007_05_15_1847515	8	By department guidelines , there is no space problem : With a capacity of 1,900 students , the building has room to accommodate all three schools .
2007_05_15_1847515	9	The projected fall enrollment for the Brooklyn High School of the Arts is 762 , and the projected enrollment for the Math and Science school is 458 , a total of 1,220 students .
2007_05_15_1847515	10	Even if the Khalil Gibran school fills its 60 seats , down from a planned 80 , the building would still be more than 600 students under capacity .
2007_05_15_1847515	11	It was the second time this month that a group of angry parents in Brooklyn objected to sharing space with the Khalil Gibran school , which would enroll only sixth graders at first .
2007_05_15_1847515	12	Ten days ago , the department scuttled its plan to put it in the building that houses Public School 282 , an elementary school in Park Slope , after parents protested over sharing space and after a columnist for The New York Sun called the school a madrassa , an Islamic religious school , and suggested that citizens carry torches and surround City Hall to prevent its opening .
2007_05_15_1847515	13	But this time , the Department of Education seems determined to tamp down the rebellion . ''
2007_05_15_1847515	14	We are not looking for alternatives for Khalil Gibran , '' said Melody Meyer , a spokeswoman who attended last night 's meeting . ''
2007_05_15_1847515	15	The school will open as planned . ''
2007_05_15_1847515	16	Mr. Harries took a verbal beating from parents , furious at what they said were broken promises from the department to update a science laboratory and other facilities . ''
2007_05_15_1847515	17	I ca n't sit here and justify when commitments were not fulfilled in the past , '' he said at one point .
2007_05_15_1847515	18	Debbie Almontaser , the principal of Khalil Gibran , spoke briefly , promising that the school would have a standard college preparatory curriculum . ''
2007_05_15_1847515	19	It is going to be quite rigorous and challenging , '' she said .
2007_05_15_1847515	20	Since first announcing the school in February , the Education Department has defended the project , which first appeared ambitious , even idealistic , but has since been bogged down by bad publicity and furious parents .
2007_05_15_1847515	21	By one measure , the school appears well on its way to a September opening .
2007_05_15_1847515	22	Ms. Almontaser has already ordered a library of Arabic-language textbooks from Scholastic , mainly Arabic translations of American children 's books , Ms. Meyer said .
2007_05_15_1847515	23	The president of the United Federation of Teachers , Randi Weingarten , has pledged her support for the school .
2007_05_15_1847515	24	And despite the considerable pressure it is under , the department yesterday continued to insist that the school would open in September in the Dean Street building .
2007_05_15_1847515	25	The department has promised that Khalil Gibran will take up three classrooms in the building -- two for instruction and one for office space .
2007_05_15_1847515	26	But if it does open , as the department maintains it will , the Khalil Gibran school may struggle to fill its available seats .
2007_05_15_1847515	27	As of yesterday , no students were enrolled .
2007_05_15_1847515	28	And with only weeks left before classes are dismissed for the summer , most fifth graders already knew which school they would attend in the fall .
2007_05_15_1847515	29	The department has sent letters to parents of fifth graders across the city , listing Khalil Gibran as an available school for incoming sixth graders .
2007_05_15_1847517	0	A new Internet tool to help individuals and communities curb their role in adding global-warming carbon emissions will be announced today at a conference in New York of mayors from around the world , said a person who built the Web technology .
2007_05_15_1847517	1	Many environmental groups offer simple carbon calculators on the Web , which allow people to figure the carbon dioxide production from daily routines like driving a car or lighting a house . ''
2007_05_15_1847517	2	But this is serious software , serious quantitative methods and social networking technology brought to the green world , '' said Ron Dembo , the chief executive of Zerofootprint , a nonprofit group that provides information and services to combat global warming .
2007_05_15_1847517	3	Mr. Dembo , a founder of an analytics software company and a former computer scientist at Yale University , said details of the Web service would be described today at the C40 Large Cities Climate Summit , by David Miller , the mayor of Toronto .
2007_05_15_1847517	4	The Web service , called GoZero Footprint City Calculator , is a collaboration of Zerofootprint and Business Objects , a maker of business intelligence software .
2007_05_15_1847517	5	Bernard Liautaud , the chairman of Business Objects , said that his company had joined the project as an initial step in using its software to help people on the Web create a '' collective intelligence '' to address humanitarian issues .
2007_05_15_1847517	6	On the interactive climate site , people will be able to enter data , see the carbon effect and how their carbon footprint compares with averages in their city and in cities worldwide .
2007_05_15_1847517	7	They will also be able to do what-if simulations , to see how changes in their activities affect carbon emissions .
2007_05_15_1847517	8	The anonymous data will be collected for analysis by climate change scientists and others .
2007_05_15_1847517	9	A link to the new site , Mr. Dembo said , will be at the '' initiatives '' section of Zerofootprint.net . ''
2007_05_15_1847517	10	The idea , '' he said , '' is something that will address millions of people and is infinitely customizable to any culture or lifestyle . ''
2007_05_15_1847517	11	The top-down global warming policies of governments , Mr. Dembo said , like creating environmental regulations and product standards , are important . ''
2007_05_15_1847517	12	But bottom-up is where we 're really going to make progress , '' he said , '' and this is a tool that can potentially enable a really massive carbon footprint reduction . ''
2007_05_15_1847517	13	The mayors ' summit is a four-day gathering that began yesterday with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg as its host .
2007_05_15_1847517	14	It is partly sponsored by the Clinton Climate Initiative , a project led by former President Bill Clinton .
2007_05_15_1847517	15	The meeting is the second mayors ' climate summit ; the first took place two years ago in London .
2007_05_15_1847517	16	Cities , according to the organizers , are responsible for three-quarters of the world 's energy consumption , and have '' a critical role to play in the reduction of carbon emissions and the reversal of dangerous climate change . ''
2007_05_15_1847519	0	The honchos at NBC Universal made it official yesterday , announcing that they were not consigning a well-known New York institution to the dustbin of history . ''
2007_05_15_1847519	1	Law & Order '' -- we 're talking about the original show ; if it were a soft drink , it might be called '' Law & Order Classic '' -- will be back for another season on the NBC network .
2007_05_15_1847519	2	There had been rumblings that '' L&O '' would be scrapped , having begun to look a bit jowly and long-toothed after serving its network masters well for 17 seasons .
2007_05_15_1847519	3	But they have agreed to an 18th season , NBC plenipotentiaries said .
2007_05_15_1847519	4	They described the show as '' the mother ship , '' a reference to the fact that several '' L&O '' offspring colonize the airwaves . ''
2007_05_15_1847519	5	Mother ship '' sounded almost affectionate .
2007_05_15_1847519	6	But in the same breath , Kevin Reilly , the president of NBC Entertainment , called the show '' probably the best utility player we 've got . ''
2007_05_15_1847519	7	To these ears , that baseball phrase fell a few degrees short of affection .
2007_05_15_1847519	8	It made '' L&O '' sound not so much like the magnificent Derek Jeter as the serviceable Miguel Cairo .
2007_05_15_1847519	9	The show is being moved to a new time : 8 p.m. on Sunday .
2007_05_15_1847519	10	It happens to be the same slot that was assigned to the '' West Wing '' series just before NBC gave it the hook last year .
2007_05_15_1847519	11	Still , the point is that '' L&O '' is being given another shot to continue its pursuit of '' Gunsmoke , '' the record holder for the longest-running television drama : 20 seasons .
2007_05_15_1847519	12	The network 's decision has consequences for New Yorkers .
2007_05_15_1847519	13	For one thing , there scarcely breathes the New York actor worth his or her SAG card who has not turned up on '' L&O . ''
2007_05_15_1847519	14	It is probably the most frequently cited credit in any Playbill cast list .
2007_05_15_1847519	15	Over the years , the series has made the city its soundstage .
2007_05_15_1847519	16	Some neighborhoods welcome it as an old friend .
2007_05_15_1847519	17	Others resent it as an intruder , with its trucks that gobble up parking spaces and crews that disrupt normal street life .
2007_05_15_1847519	18	Liked or not , it is a true New Yorker , even if at times it shows addresses that would put the buildings somewhere in the East River .
2007_05_15_1847519	19	Apparently , producing '' L&O '' has become a tad expensive for NBC 's tastes .
2007_05_15_1847519	20	Some cost-cutting seems likely .
2007_05_15_1847519	21	The payroll might easily be pared by tossing a character or two overboard .
2007_05_15_1847519	22	One discard could be the district attorney , now played by Fred Dalton Thompson , the lawyer turned actor turned senator turned actor turned possible presidential candidate .
2007_05_15_1847519	23	Mr. Thompson is mulling whether to run , evidently in the belief that the Republican field could always use one more middle-aged white man .
2007_05_15_1847519	24	If he did enter the race , he would create a complication under the Federal Communications Commission 's equal-time rule .
2007_05_15_1847519	25	NBC might have to put all 10 ( and counting ) Republican candidates on the air .
2007_05_15_1847519	26	FORTUNATELY for the network , that problem may solve itself .
2007_05_15_1847519	27	Asked yesterday about the Thompson factor , Mr. Reilly replied , '' It 's pretty clear that Fred is going to be leaving the cast of the show , no matter what . ''
2007_05_15_1847519	28	That came as news to us .
2007_05_15_1847519	29	If Mr. Thompson does go , why not pocket his salary by eliminating the district attorney altogether ?
2007_05_15_1847519	30	It 's not as if the character does much more than heckle his assistants every 10 minutes or so .
2007_05_15_1847519	31	Whatever happens on NBC , a Thompson candidacy would still leave questions about reruns on cable television , especially the TNT network , which is wall-to-wall '' L&O '' some days .
2007_05_15_1847519	32	Counting the original show and its offshoots , Mr. Thompson has appeared in 139 episodes .
2007_05_15_1847519	33	Should they be dropped for the duration of the presidential campaign ?
2007_05_15_1847519	34	Or should , instead , the entire gang of Republicans be given equal time ?
2007_05_15_1847519	35	Unlike the case with the broadcasting networks , the rules for cable television are '' completely up in the air , '' an F.C.C. official said .
2007_05_15_1847519	36	One Republican with a special stake in this is Rudolph W. Giuliani .
2007_05_15_1847519	37	He has an '' L&O '' credit of his own , having played himself as mayor in a 2000 episode .
2007_05_15_1847519	38	And what about the seven '' L&O '' episodes in which Donna Hanover , the second Mrs. Giuliani , played a judge ?
2007_05_15_1847519	39	If shown now , would they put Mr. Giuliani at an unfair disadvantage by reminding some voters of his complex marital history ?
2007_05_15_1847519	40	If so , what would be the correct solution -- drop Ms. Hanover for the duration , and deprive her of residual checks , or give equal time to Wife No. 3 , Judith Stish Ross Nathan Giuliani ?
2007_05_15_1847519	41	Maybe it 's best not to even go there .
2007_05_15_1847519	42	This is starting to sound less like '' Law & Order '' and more like '' Days of Our Lives . ''
2007_05_15_1847521	0	The University of Texas fired the director of financial aid at its Austin campus for improper conduct yesterday , reporting that he had more ties to a student loan company than had been known and had begun recommending the lender to students a few months after he bought stock in its parent company .
2007_05_15_1847521	1	The university announced the dismissal of the director , Lawrence W. Burt , who had been on paid leave since last month , as it released a 33-page report -- with an additional 100 pages of internal e-mail messages , letters and analyses from the Austin financial aid office -- that provided the most detailed public documentation yet of how lenders sought favor inside a university .
2007_05_15_1847521	2	The report described a university financial aid office that was oblivious to conflicts of interest and kept meticulous track of '' lender treats '' like ice cream , happy hours and birthday cakes that apparently were considered in deciding whether to put loan companies on lists of lenders recommended to students .
2007_05_15_1847521	3	The report called the compilation of such lists '' flawed '' and done at the sole discretion of Dr. Burt , who was placed on leave after it was disclosed he held stock in Education Lending Group while making decisions about Student Loan Xpress , one of its affiliates . ''
2007_05_15_1847521	4	It is not at all clear that the factors considered by Dr. Burt '' in putting together lender lists '' served the students ' best interests or , even if they did , it is not clear how these factors were weighed in making the final decision , '' the report said .
2007_05_15_1847521	5	It said Student Loan Xpress was one of the most frequent givers of '' treats . ''
2007_05_15_1847521	6	Dr. Burt is one of several university financial aid officers who have come under scrutiny as a result of investigations into the relationships between student loan companies and the university financial aid offices that students rely on for advice in paying for college .
2007_05_15_1847521	7	His dismissal is the strongest response to the investigations to date by any university .
2007_05_15_1847521	8	The university said that his acceptance of stock in a private transaction and subsequent purchase of more stock violated university standards of conduct and that his failure to disclose his holdings as he was making decisions about the lender '' compounded the conflict and the appearance of impropriety . '' ''
2007_05_15_1847521	9	Restoring the credibility of our Office of Student Financial Services is paramount , '' William Powers Jr. , president of the University of Texas at Austin , said in a statement Dirk Jordan , a lawyer representing Dr. Burt , said , '' His termination is unfair and unjustified . ''
2007_05_15_1847521	10	Mr. Jordan said that nothing in the report showed that student borrowers had suffered . ''
2007_05_15_1847521	11	There 's no student that was impacted negatively , '' he said .
2007_05_15_1847521	12	The report said that over a five-year period , Student Loan Xpress had the No. 1 spot on every preferred lender list reviewed but one .
2007_05_15_1847521	13	This was so even though no employee of the aid office '' was able to articulate a compelling case '' for that decision .
2007_05_15_1847521	14	The company 's customer services to students , for example , were often rated as '' average , '' while its '' visibility '' -- '' based on number of lunches , breakfasts and extracurricular functions '' for financial aid staff -- was '' very good . ''
2007_05_15_1847521	15	The report pointed to internal university documents showing how lenders sought access to students through gifts to university officials .
2007_05_15_1847521	16	Just this past February , Tom Ramaeker of Access Group , another lender , sent an e-mail message to a financial aid officer to find out whether his company had '' made the cut '' for the 2007-8 preferred lender list .
2007_05_15_1847521	17	He went on to offer to take Dr. Burt and a subordinate to play golf .
2007_05_15_1847521	18	Mr. Ramaeker did not return a call seeking comment yesterday .
2007_05_15_1847521	19	A spokesman for CIT Group , which acquired Student Loan Xpress in 2005 , declined to comment on the report .
2007_05_15_1847521	20	The report cited drafts of letters it obtained that indicated that Dr. Burt had written letters recommending Student Loan Xpress to his counterparts at other universities .
2007_05_15_1847521	21	It also found that he had approved an arrangement with one lender , Collegiate Funding Services , in which the college apparently used its software for mandatory exit interviews for seniors to allow the company to pitch consolidation loans to those students .
2007_05_15_1847521	22	It found that Dr. Burt had sent an e-mail message to a company representative telling him how he had worn a loan company shirt while giving an interview to Fox News . ''
2007_05_15_1847521	23	I did a billboard for you , '' Dr. Burt wrote .
2007_05_15_1847521	24	The loan company official responded by asking about football tickets to a university game .
2007_05_15_1847521	25	He added that he was willing to pay for Dr. Burt 's tickets and that Dr. Burt could stay at his house .
2007_05_15_1847521	26	Included in the report is a chart kept by the financial aid office at the Austin campus listing the dates and hosts for various '' lender events , '' including taco lunches , birthday pies , Christmas cookies , cheesecake , ice cream and cupcakes .
2007_05_15_1847521	27	Dr. Burt 's lawyer said his client had not created the list of '' lender treats . ''
2007_05_15_1847521	28	The Daily Texan , the student newspaper at the University of Texas at Austin , first reported on the '' lender treats . ''
2007_05_15_1847521	29	The report also provided a full account of Dr. Burt 's financial dealings with Education Lending Group and Student Loan Xpress , first publicized by New York 's attorney general , Andrew M. Cuomo .
2007_05_15_1847521	30	According to the report , in January 2001 Dr. Burt bought 800 shares and 200 for his son in a company called Direct III Marketing , the predecessor of Education Lending Group .
2007_05_15_1847521	31	Later that year the company became a full-service student lender .
2007_05_15_1847521	32	Dr. Burt bought 1,000 more shares and 500 warrants to buy that many more shares in December 2001 .
2007_05_15_1847521	33	In March 2002 , Dr. Burt added Student Loan Xpress to the university 's list of recommended lenders .
2007_05_15_1847521	34	He sold his shares in February 2005 when CIT Group acquired the parent company of Student Loan Xpress .
2007_05_15_1847521	35	Mr. Jordan , Dr. Burt 's lawyer , said his client had bought the shares before the company began offering student loans . ''
2007_05_15_1847521	36	There 's nothing about his ownership in the stock that caused him to direct any students to borrow from Student Loan Xpress , '' Mr. Jordan said , adding that the company 's share of student borrowing at the university remained low . ''
2007_05_15_1847521	37	If he was trying to steer people their way , he did n't do a good job . ''
2007_05_15_1847522	0	A teacher and an assistant principal were suspended Monday for a prank in which sixth graders on a sleepover trip were told that a gunman was prowling nearby and were ordered to hide in silence .
2007_05_15_1847522	1	School officials in this small city , about 35 miles south of Nashville , took the action against the teacher , Quentin Mastin , and the assistant principal , Don Bartch , because of the incident Thursday during a trip by a group of Scales Elementary School pupils to secluded Fall Creek Falls State Park , a school spokeswoman , Cheryl Harris , said . ''
2007_05_15_1847522	2	It was a spontaneous prank that got out of hand , '' Ms. Harris said .
2007_05_15_1847522	3	The leaders usually pull a prank on the students during the weeklong trip , typically a spine-chilling ghost story , and the 69 children had been told to expect one this year , she said .
2007_05_15_1847522	4	But on the trip 's last night , Mr. Mastin told the children that a park ranger had warned that there was a gunman roving the park , and that they should take cover .
2007_05_15_1847522	5	While the children hid under tables in a dormitory , a chaperone pulled a hood up over her head and rattled the door from the outside .
2007_05_15_1847522	6	Some children wept in fear in the dark , parents have said in news accounts . ''
2007_05_15_1847522	7	At first I thought I was going to die , '' a student , Shay Naylor , 11 , told The Tennessean newspaper in Nashville . ''
2007_05_15_1847522	8	A teacher told us , ` We just got a call that there 's been a random shooting . '
2007_05_15_1847522	9	I was freaked out .
2007_05_15_1847522	10	I thought it was serious . ''
2007_05_15_1847522	11	Afterward , the adult leaders turned the lights on and admitted it was a prank , praising the students for following what are called '' code red '' emergency school procedures .
2007_05_15_1847522	12	Ms. Harris said the choice of prank was unfortunate , particularly given the recent shootings at Virginia Tech University , in which 32 students and teachers were killed . ''
2007_05_15_1847522	13	I do n't think this person , this lead teacher , was even associating what he was doing with that , unfortunately , '' Ms. Harris said .
2007_05_15_1847522	14	Some parents , who gave their consent for the trip but were not told of the prank beforehand , were not amused to learn about it .
2007_05_15_1847522	15	More than 40 parents attended a meeting with the principal on Saturday , and some parents have reported that the incident terrified their children .
2007_05_15_1847522	16	Jessica Giles , an assistant professor of psychology at the Peabody College of Education at Vanderbilt University , said such an incident could create lasting anxiety , and lead students to doubt their teachers in a real emergency .
2007_05_15_1847523	0	President Bush announced on Monday that he had directed his administration to begin the long process of establishing higher fuel efficiency standards for new cars .
2007_05_15_1847523	1	But officials said that it was unclear if at the end of that process Mr. Bush would take it upon himself to raise the gas mileage of the nation 's automobiles , which has not significantly increased in decades .
2007_05_15_1847523	2	And Mr. Bush , speaking in the Rose Garden on Monday afternoon , said nothing would be put into effect until the regulatory process was completed at the end of 2008 , just weeks before the end of his term .
2007_05_15_1847523	3	Environmental groups , which have long called for substantial increases in the government-mandated fuel standards , expressed skepticism that the administration would enact new standards without Congressional action , and dissatisfaction that Mr. Bush had not offered specifics .
2007_05_15_1847523	4	And Representative Edward J. Markey , Democrat of Massachusetts and the chairman of the House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming , called the announcement '' a stall tactic . ''
2007_05_15_1847523	5	Mr. Bush 's announcement came during a period of new headlines about resurgent gasoline prices , as well as international and domestic political pressure to control American emissions of heat-trapping gases from burning petroleum and other fossil fuels .
2007_05_15_1847523	6	It comes six weeks after the Supreme Court , rebuffing the administration 's arguments , ruled in favor of states that were seeking new federal controls on these emissions from automobiles .
2007_05_15_1847523	7	The court found on April 2 that carbon dioxide , the principal heat-trapping gas , is a pollutant under the Clean Air Act and must be regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency unless the agency scientifically determines that it does not contribute to climate change or that action is not necessary .
2007_05_15_1847523	8	A growing scientific consensus holds that carbon dioxide emissions are a serious problem that ought to be addressed urgently .
2007_05_15_1847523	9	The E.P.A. administrator , Stephen Johnson , said during a teleconference with reporters on Monday that the administration was not arguing otherwise . ''
2007_05_15_1847523	10	We accept the Supreme Court 's decision , '' Mr. Johnson said , hailing what he said was '' the first regulatory step to craft a proposal to control greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles . ''
2007_05_15_1847523	11	Mr. Bush began the process with an executive order directing the E.P.A. , the Department of Transportation , the Department of Energy and the Department of Agriculture to explore regulatory options to enact a proposal he announced in his State of the Union address earlier , which set a goal of reducing the projected growth of oil consumption within 10 years to a level 20 percent lower than current forecasts .
2007_05_15_1847523	12	Officials have expressed frustration that Congress has not enacted his plan , based on efficiency standards as well as incentives for alternative fuels , which environmentalists have harshly criticized as insufficient .
2007_05_15_1847523	13	Mr. Bush said on Monday that he still preferred Congressional action to executive action and that his officials would '' work with Congress to pass the 20-in-10 bill . ''
2007_05_15_1847523	14	He said he had directed his cabinet secretaries to complete the regulatory process by the end of 2008 and to '' evaluate the benefits and costs before they put forth the new regulation . ''
2007_05_15_1847523	15	The president has opposed setting across-the-board standards of the kind that Congress imposed decades ago , preferring flexibility to account for vehicle size and safety specifications , said Scott Stanzel , a White House spokesman .
2007_05_15_1847523	16	Senator Harry Reid , Democrat of Nevada and the majority leader , said in a statement that the Senate would move forward with its own proposals , which include raising average passenger car fuel standards to 35 miles per gallon over 10 years from 25 m.p.g. .
2007_05_15_1847523	17	But , he said of the president , '' if he brings forward proposals that make legal , economic and environmental sense , we will work with him as we legislate . ''
2007_05_15_1847523	18	Mr. Johnson , of the E.P.A. , said that if the administration moved forward with the new rules , they would go into effect by the end of 2008 .
2007_05_15_1847523	19	Officials said the review would also consider regulatory avenues toward increasing the production of alternative and renewable fuels to 35 billion gallons a year , which would be significantly above the current mandate .
2007_05_15_1847523	20	Environmental advocates said that taking many months to propose new rules , receive public comment and issue them in final form was reasonable .
2007_05_15_1847523	21	But they said Monday 's announcement gave them no reason to abandon their doubts about the probable result . ''
2007_05_15_1847523	22	This really amounts to saying , ` Trust us , we 're doing something , ' '' said David Doniger , policy director for the climate center of the Natural Resources Defense Council , which was a party to the Supreme Court case . ''
2007_05_15_1847523	23	It 's a clever effort , maybe a half-clever effort , to slip out of a corner .
2007_05_15_1847523	24	We have n't been promised any specific reduction in global warming pollution , or any specific increase in the efficiency in cars . ''
2007_05_15_1847523	25	He said the president 's directive seemed to limit the E.P.A. 's flexibility by requiring that it act with sister agencies , meaning , '' they can only walk as fast as the slowest one of them . ''
2007_05_15_1847523	26	Joan Claybrook , president of Public Citizen , a public interest group , criticized the president 's plan for relying on his '' 20-in-10 '' proposal as a starting point because of its large reliance on alternative fuels , which '' opens the door for coal-to-liquids based fuel , which has the potential to emit more than twice as much carbon dioxide as gasoline . ''
2007_05_15_1847523	27	She called on Congress to set standards legislatively .
2007_05_15_1847523	28	Arguments in Mileage Lawsuit By The New York Times SAN FRANCISCO , May 14 -- Lawyers representing California and 10 other states gave arguments here on Monday in a lawsuit intended to force the government to increase gas mileage requirements for minivans , pickups and sport utility vehicles .
2007_05_15_1847523	29	The suit , filed in November , asks the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit to force the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to conduct an environmental impact study of fuel efficiency standards announced in April 2006 .
2007_05_15_1847523	30	Those rules , which require automakers to act by 2010 , raised fuel efficiency requirements by a little over a mile per gallon .
2007_05_15_1847523	31	Attorney General Jerry Brown of California said the rules failed to take into account how man-made pollution affected the environment , as well as ignored political instability in the Middle East and the development of newer , cleaner fuels . ''
2007_05_15_1847523	32	They did n't consider global warming ; they did n't consider alternative technologies ; therefore they did n't do their job , '' said Mr. Brown , standing on the steps of the courthouse . ''
2007_05_15_1847523	33	It does n't make any sense from a science point of view or a homeland security point of view . ''
2007_05_15_1847523	34	Charles Miller , a spokesman for the Department of Justice , said the department had no comment .
2007_05_15_1847524	0	When 10 Republican presidential candidates assemble on a stage tonight in South Carolina for their second debate , viewers will get a reminder of how the sheer size of the field in both parties limits the opportunities for probing questioning .
2007_05_15_1847524	1	But one group is trying to draw a line .
2007_05_15_1847524	2	Sojourners , a liberal Christian organization , plans to sponsor a Democratic presidential forum but has invited just three of the nine Democratic contenders -- Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton , Senator Barack Obama and John Edwards -- based on their double-digit standings in national polls . ''
2007_05_15_1847524	3	We have put together a forum seeking to have a thoughtful and substantive conversation with each candidate -- with each of the leading candidates -- about faith , values and poverty , '' Jack J. Pannell , the organization 's press secretary , said .
2007_05_15_1847524	4	The June 4 debate will be held in Washington and televised on CNN ; a similarly exclusive Republican forum is being planned for Iowa this fall .
2007_05_15_1847524	5	For anyone frustrated with the unwieldy nature of the presidential debates , this may not be the perfect solution .
2007_05_15_1847524	6	The three candidates declined a request by Sojourners that they appear on the stage together .
2007_05_15_1847524	7	Instead , they will appear one after the other and spend 20 minutes each answering questions on a narrow range of questions from the Rev. Jim Wallis , the founder of the group , and others .
2007_05_15_1847524	8	Mr. Pannell said the campaign of one Democrat who was not invited ( whom he would not name ) tried to get the candidate past the rope , to no avail . ''
2007_05_15_1847524	9	We are not as interested in the debate business , '' he said , '' as we are interested in having a substantive conversation about what matters . ''
2007_05_15_1847525	0	A group of Catholic Democrats in Congress objected yesterday to Pope Benedict XVI 's suggestion that lawmakers who support abortion rights should be excommunicated .
2007_05_15_1847525	1	In a pointed response , 18 House Democrats suggested that the pope was out of line , saying religious interference in politics contravened the freedoms upon which the United States was founded .
2007_05_15_1847525	2	Among those signing the statement were Representatives Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut , Patrick J. Kennedy of Rhode Island and Carolyn McCarthy of New York . ''
2007_05_15_1847525	3	Religious sanction in the political arena directly conflicts with our fundamental beliefs about the role and responsibility of democratic representatives in a pluralistic America , '' they said in a statement .
2007_05_15_1847525	4	When he ran for president in 2004 , Senator John Kerry , a Catholic who supports abortion rights , faced demands from some bishops that he no longer receive communion .
2007_05_15_1847526	0	Add another consultant to the list of those advising Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton : John Kao , a corporate communications consultant who is based in San Francisco and advocates using the techniques of musical improvisation to get the creative juices flowing and leave competitors in the dust .
2007_05_15_1847526	1	Mrs. Clinton paid Mr. Kao $ 70,000 to advise her during her Senate re-election campaign in 2006 , but the payment did not appear in her financial filings until the end of the first quarter of this year .
2007_05_15_1847526	2	Howard Wolfson , a Clinton spokesman , said Mr. Kao was continuing to advise Mrs. Clinton , without pay , in her presidential bid , on issues of innovation and how the United States can compete in the 21st century market .
2007_05_15_1847526	3	Mr. Kao and Mrs. Clinton met in 2004 as part of a Defense Department advisory group to help the military think creatively about '' transformation , '' leadership and other issues .
2007_05_15_1847526	4	Mr. Kao , who has taught at Harvard Business School , is the author of '' Jamming : The Art and Discipline of Corporate Creativity , '' in which he explains how members of a work team can adapt the principles of improvisational music to collaborate at a higher , more creative level , a process he calls '' getting to cool . ''
2007_05_15_1847526	5	In his '' Transformation Manifesto , '' a pocket guide , Mr. Kao suggests hiring a '' chief destruction officer '' instead of a '' chief innovation officer . ''
2007_05_15_1847526	6	Organizations , he says , '' must ruthlessly trash outmoded obstructions to creativity , '' including '' a confining brand image '' and '' revered memories of old successes . ''
2007_05_15_1847526	7	Mr. Wolfson called Mr. Kao brilliant , adding , '' He provides an out-of-the-box thinking that is also very grounded in the everyday world . ''
2007_05_15_1847527	0	Senator Tim Johnson , Democrat of South Dakota , is preparing for a return to the Senate after a brain hemorrhage in December , and members of his party say they expect him to be a candidate for a third term next year .
2007_05_15_1847527	1	Colleagues said Mr. Johnson , who left rehabilitation late last month and is now at home , should be back at work before long .
2007_05_15_1847527	2	Making sure his campaign did not fall behind financially while he was recovering , dozens of Senate Democrats have held fund-raising events on his behalf and have reached out to their own supporters .
2007_05_15_1847527	3	His campaign reported raising $ 633,000 in the first three months of the year , leaving him $ 1.2 million in the bank as of March 31 .
2007_05_15_1847527	4	Mr. Johnson 's delicate political condition has also chilled potential Republican opposition in the state that turned the Democratic leader Tom Daschle out of the Senate in 2004 .
2007_05_15_1847527	5	Gov. Mike Rounds , considered the most formidable Republican challenger , has shown little interest to date , and other potential Republican candidates have treaded lightly as well .
2007_05_15_1847529	0	Inspectors for the International Atomic Energy Agency have concluded that Iran appears to have solved most of its technological problems and is now beginning to enrich uranium on a far larger scale than before , according to the agency 's top officials .
2007_05_15_1847529	1	The findings may change the calculus of diplomacy in Europe and in Washington , which has aimed to force a suspension of Iran 's enrichment activities in large part to prevent it from learning how to produce weapons-grade material .
2007_05_15_1847529	2	In a short-notice inspection of Iran 's main nuclear facility at Natanz on Sunday , conducted in advance of a report to the United Nations Security Council due early next week , the inspectors found that Iranian engineers were already using roughly 1,300 centrifuges and were producing fuel suitable for nuclear reactors , according to diplomats and nuclear experts here .
2007_05_15_1847529	3	Until recently , the Iranians were having difficulty keeping the delicate centrifuges spinning at the tremendous speeds necessary to make nuclear fuel , and often were running them empty , or not at all .
2007_05_15_1847529	4	Now , those roadblocks appear to have been surmounted . ''
2007_05_15_1847529	5	We believe they pretty much have the knowledge about how to enrich , '' said Mohamed ElBaradei , the director general of the energy agency , who clashed with the Bush administration four years ago when he declared that there was no evidence that Iraq had resumed its nuclear program . ''
2007_05_15_1847529	6	From now on , it is simply a question of perfecting that knowledge .
2007_05_15_1847529	7	People will not like to hear it , but that 's a fact . ''
2007_05_15_1847529	8	It is unclear whether Iran can sustain its recent progress .
2007_05_15_1847529	9	Major setbacks are common in uranium enrichment , and experts say it is entirely possible that miscalculation , equipment failures or sabotage could prevent the Iranian government from reaching its goal of producing fuel on what President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad boasts is '' an industrial scale . ''
2007_05_15_1847529	10	The material produced so far would have to undergo further enrichment before it could be transformed into bomb-grade material , and to accomplish that Iran would probably have to evict the I.A.E.A. inspectors , as North Korea did four years ago .
2007_05_15_1847529	11	Even then it is unclear whether the Iranians would have the technology to produce a weapon small enough to fit atop their missiles , a significant engineering challenge .
2007_05_15_1847529	12	Iran says its nuclear program is intended to produce energy , not weapons .
2007_05_15_1847529	13	While the United Nations Security Council has passed a resolution demanding that Iran suspend all of its nuclear activities , and twice imposed sanctions for its refusal to do so , some European nations , and particularly Russia , have questioned whether the demand for suspension still makes sense .
2007_05_15_1847529	14	The logic of demanding suspension was that it would delay the day that Iran gained the knowledge to produce its own nuclear fuel , what the Israelis used to refer to as '' the point of no return . ''
2007_05_15_1847529	15	Those favoring unconditional engagement with Iran have argued that the current strategy was creating a stalemate that the Iranians are exploiting , allowing them to make technological leaps while the Security Council steps up sanctions .
2007_05_15_1847529	16	The Bush administration , in contrast , has argued that it will never negotiate while the Iranians speed ever closer to nuclear-weapons capacity , saying there has to be a standstill as long as talks proceed .
2007_05_15_1847529	17	In a telephone interview , R. Nicholas Burns , the undersecretary of state for policy , who is carrying out the Iran strategy , said that while he had not heard about the I.A.E.A. 's newest findings they would not affect American policy . ''
2007_05_15_1847529	18	We 're proceeding under the assumption that there is still time for diplomacy to work , '' he said , though he added that if the Iranians did not agree to suspend production by the time the leaders of the largest industrial nations meet next month , '' we will move ahead toward a third set of sanctions . ''
2007_05_15_1847529	19	Dr. ElBaradei has always been skeptical of that strategy , telling European foreign ministers that he doubted the Iranians would fully suspend their nuclear activities , and that a face-saving way must be found to resolve the impasse . ''
2007_05_15_1847529	20	Quite clearly suspension is a requirement by the Security Council , and I would hope the Iranians would listen to the world community , '' he said . ''
2007_05_15_1847529	21	But from a proliferation perspective , the fact of the matter is that one of the purposes of suspension -- keeping them from getting the knowledge -- has been overtaken by events .
2007_05_15_1847529	22	The focus now should be to stop them from going to industrial scale production , to allow us to do a full-court-press inspection and to be sure they remain inside the treaty . ''
2007_05_15_1847529	23	The report to the Security Council next week is expected to say that since February 2006 , when the Iranians stopped complying with an agreement on broad inspections around the country by the agency , the I.A.E.A. 's understanding of '' the scope and content '' of Iran 's nuclear activities has deteriorated .
2007_05_15_1847529	24	Inspectors are concerned that Iran has declined to answer a series of questions , posed more than a year ago , about information Iran probably received from Abdul Qadeer Khan , the Pakistani nuclear engineer .
2007_05_15_1847529	25	Of particular interest is a document that shows how to make uranium into spheres , a shape suitable for use in a weapon .
2007_05_15_1847529	26	The inspection conducted on Sunday took place on two hours ' notice , a period so short that it appears unlikely that the Iranians could have turned on their centrifuges to impress the inspectors .
2007_05_15_1847529	27	According to diplomats familiar with the inspectors ' report , in addition to 1,300 working centrifuges , 300 more were being tested and appeared ready to be fed raw nuclear fuel as soon as late this week , the diplomats said .
2007_05_15_1847529	28	Another 300 were reported to be under construction .
2007_05_15_1847529	29	The I.A.E.A. reported more than a week ago that approximately 1,300 centrifuges were in place , but nuclear experts here said that what struck them now was that all the centrifuges appeared to be enriching uranium and running smoothly . ''
2007_05_15_1847529	30	They are at the stage where they are doing one cascade a week , '' said one diplomat familiar with the analysis of Iran 's activities , who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of the information .
2007_05_15_1847529	31	A cascade has 164 centrifuges , and experts say that at this pace , Iran could have 3,000 centrifuges operating by June -- enough , if the uranium were enriched further , to make one bomb 's worth of nuclear material every year .
2007_05_15_1847529	32	Tehran may , the diplomat said , be able to build an additional 5,000 centrifuges by the end of the year , for a total of 8,000 .
2007_05_15_1847529	33	The inspectors have tested the output and concluded that Iran is producing reactor-grade uranium , enriched to a little less than 5 percent purity .
2007_05_15_1847529	34	But that still worries American officials and I.A.E.A. experts .
2007_05_15_1847529	35	If Iran stores the uranium and later runs it through centrifuges for four or five more months , it can raise the enrichment to 90 percent , the level needed for a nuclear weapon .
2007_05_15_1847529	36	Some Bush administration officials and some nuclear experts here at the I.A.E.A. and elsewhere suspect that the Iranians may not be driving for a weapon but the ability to have sufficient stockpiles of low-enriched uranium that they could produce a bomb within months of evicting inspectors , as North Korea did in 2003 .
2007_05_15_1847529	37	That capacity alone could serve as a nuclear deterrent .
2007_05_15_1847529	38	One senior European diplomat , who declined to speak for attribution , said that Washington would now have to confront the question of whether it wants to keep Iran from producing any nuclear material , or whether it wants to keep it from gaining the ability to build a weapon on short notice .
2007_05_15_1847529	39	Continued stalemate , the diplomat said , allows Iran to move toward that ability .
2007_05_15_1847529	40	But hawks in the administration say that the only position President Bush can take now , without appearing to back down , is to stick to the administration 's past argument that '' not one centrifuge spins '' in Iran .
2007_05_15_1847529	41	They argue for escalating sanctions and the threat that , if diplomacy fails , the United States could destroy the nuclear facilities .
2007_05_15_1847529	42	But even inside the administration , many officials , particularly in the State Department and the Pentagon , argue that military action would create greater chaos in the Middle East and Iranian retribution against American forces in Iraq , and possibly elsewhere .
2007_05_15_1847529	43	Moreover , they have argued that Iran 's enrichment facilities are still at an early enough stage that a military strike would not set the country 's program back very far .
2007_05_15_1847529	44	Such a strike , they argue , would make sense only once large facilities had been built .
2007_05_15_1847529	45	Correction : June 8 , 2007 , Friday A front-page article on May 15 about the International Atomic Energy Agency 's latest assessment of Iran 's nuclear program referred imprecisely to information found in a design document that the agency 's inspectors have seen in Iran but that the Iranian authorities have declined to explain .
2007_05_15_1847529	46	The information shows how to make uranium into hemispheres , not spheres .
2007_05_15_1847529	47	( Depending on their precise design , some types of hemispheres of highly enriched uranium can be suitable for manufacturing a nuclear weapon . )
2007_05_15_1847530	0	Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said Monday that while Russia and the United States were going through a period of uneasy relations , the problems fell far short of those of the cold war and that the two countries continued to cooperate in a number of important areas . ''
2007_05_15_1847530	1	Russia is not the Soviet Union , so this is not a U.S.-Soviet relationship , '' Ms. Rice said , speaking en route to Moscow and planned meetings with President Vladimir V. Putin and senior Russian officials . ''

2007_05_15_1847530	3	The carefully tempered remarks , reflected in a transcript released by the State Department , signaled an effort by the United States to ease some of the public tensions between Moscow and Washington that have grown during the second terms of Mr. Putin and President Bush .

2007_05_15_1847530	7	Ms. Rice , who last month called Russia 's criticisms of the missile defense plan '' ludicrous , '' adopted a much more conciliatory tone , although she still expressed concerns about Russia 's behavior , including its treatment of former Soviet republics and the pace of its development toward becoming more democratic .
2007_05_15_1847530	8	A senior American diplomat said that the shift in tone was a conscious one and that the United States hoped to have productive meetings on a range of issues , including the status of an independence plan for Kosovo and missile defense . ''
2007_05_15_1847530	9	It is easy to get into a cycle where they say nasty things , and we say nasty things , and pretty soon you have a cycle of recrimination that is not about anything but itself , '' the diplomat said .

2007_05_15_1847532	0	Some of the country 's top law enforcement officials are charging that the online social network MySpace has discovered thousands of known sex offenders using its service , but has failed to act on the information .
2007_05_15_1847532	1	In a letter sent yesterday to a lawyer for MySpace , a division of the News Corporation , attorneys general from eight states said the company had not done enough to block sexual predators from the service and had failed to cooperate with the authorities . ''
2007_05_15_1847532	2	The fact that MySpace failed to come forward immediately with this information is really staggering , '' said Richard Blumenthal , attorney general of Connecticut , who added that the information had come from '' highly credible private groups '' who got their information directly from MySpace .
2007_05_15_1847532	3	In the letter , the officials asked MySpace to provide them with the number and names of sex offenders on MySpace , their addresses and a list of steps that the company has taken to alert law enforcement officials and other MySpace users . ''
2007_05_15_1847532	4	We remain concerned about the design of your site , the failure to require parental permission , and the lack of safeguards necessary to protect our children , '' the attorneys general wrote .
2007_05_15_1847532	5	The letter asked for a response from the company by May 29 .
2007_05_15_1847532	6	In a statement , Hemanshu Nigam , the chief security officer of MySpace , said the company had recently begun using new software to '' proactively identify and remove any known sex offenders from the site . ''
2007_05_15_1847532	7	Last December , MySpace announced that it would work to remove sexual predators from the site by working with Sentinel Tech Holdings , a database company based in Miami .
2007_05_15_1847532	8	MySpace said that it planned to run its membership rolls against Sentinel 's Sentry database of known sex offenders .
2007_05_15_1847532	9	MySpace said that it has spent the last five months testing the automated service .
2007_05_15_1847532	10	In his statement , Mr. Nigam also reiterated MySpace 's support for state and federal laws that would require convicted sex offenders to register their e-mail addresses and instant messenger accounts with authorities .
2007_05_15_1847532	11	He said such a step would aid the company in keeping sex offenders off the service , which has 65 million monthly visitors , according to comScore Media Metrix .
2007_05_15_1847532	12	Currently Virginia and Kentucky are among the few states with such laws .
2007_05_15_1847532	13	In December , Senator John McCain , the Arizona Republican , introduced an e-mail registration bill in the Senate , where it is still pending .
2007_05_15_1847532	14	Law enforcement officials used yesterday 's announcement to warn parents of young children of the risks of online social networks . ''
2007_05_15_1847532	15	I tell parents every day that MySpace is a dangerous place for teenagers , '' Lawrence Wasden , attorney general of Idaho , said in a statement .
2007_05_15_1847532	16	Mr. Blumenthal of Connecticut speculated that the problem might be deeper than is realized . ''
2007_05_15_1847532	17	There are apparently thousands of convicted sex offenders using their real names and identities , which is counterintuitive , '' he said . ''
2007_05_15_1847532	18	Our concern is over whether this is just the tip of the iceberg . ''
2007_05_15_1847532	19	Officials did not say what actions they would take if MySpace failed to respond adequately by May 29 .
2007_05_15_1847532	20	Mr. Blumenthal said only that all 50 states were behind the letter and that '' appropriate actions '' against the company were being considered .
2007_05_15_1847532	21	At least one child safety advocate gives MySpace good reviews for fighting sexual predators . ''
2007_05_15_1847532	22	I have n't seen in my 12 years of working on these kinds of issues a company jump through as many hoops and respond as quickly and diligently as MySpace , '' said Donna Rice Hughes , president of Enough Is Enough , an Internet safety organization .
2007_05_15_1847534	0	A Marine Corps officer testified Monday that a commander in Iraq rejected recommendations from two subordinates that he investigate accusations that marines in his battalion deliberately killed a group of civilians in Haditha in late 2005 .
2007_05_15_1847534	1	Maj. Samuel H. Carrasco , the operations officer for the Third Battalion , First Marines at the time , testified in a military hearing here that the battalion commander , Lt. Col. Jeffrey R. Chessani , forcefully dismissed advice from staff officers to look into whether marines he supervised had killed the civilians in violation of the laws of war . ''
2007_05_15_1847534	2	My men are not murderers ! ''
2007_05_15_1847534	3	Colonel Chessani yelled at Major Carrasco and the battalion 's executive officer , Maj. Kevin M. Gonzalez , during a meeting of the three officers in January 2006 , Major Carrasco told military prosecutors .
2007_05_15_1847534	4	Colonel Chessani is the highest ranking among four Marine officers who have been charged with failing to investigate properly the killing of 24 civilians by a small group of Marine infantrymen in Haditha on Nov. 19 , 2005 .
2007_05_15_1847534	5	The testimony on Monday was the first public suggestion that Colonel Chessani had disregarded his subordinates ' warnings that the killings by the marines , in response to a roadside bomb attack that killed a young lance corporal , might have constituted a war crime .
2007_05_15_1847534	6	The testimony was part of a weeklong hearing to determine whether enough evidence existed to refer to a court martial charges against another officer , Capt. Randy W. Stone , the Third Battalion 's lawyer at the time .
2007_05_15_1847534	7	But prosecutors have used the hearing to interrogate witnesses about the other marines accused of crimes in the case , including three enlisted men charged with murder .
2007_05_15_1847534	8	Colonel Chessani 's outburst came during a tense discussion in his quarters , Major Carrasco said , about an e-mail inquiry from a Time magazine reporter , Tim McGirk .
2007_05_15_1847534	9	The e-mail message had been forwarded to the battalion by a division-level press officer .
2007_05_15_1847534	10	The reporter 's questions , including some about whether marines had gathered civilians in their homes and then executed them , were regarded by the battalion 's top officers as sensational and informed by insurgent sympathizers , Major Carrasco testified .
2007_05_15_1847534	11	Major Carrasco testified that the e-mail message '' hit me in the chest like a baseball bat . ''
2007_05_15_1847534	12	He said he had been frustrated by the list of questions , which he said '' was n't one that I thought was based in reality , '' but had advised Colonel Chessani to look into the matter more thoroughly . ''
2007_05_15_1847534	13	These allegations are pretty serious , probably something we want to look at , '' he recalled saying . ''
2007_05_15_1847534	14	I was of the belief that where there 's smoke , there 's a little bit of fire . ''
2007_05_15_1847534	15	Colonel Chessani grew increasingly more agitated as the conversation went on , and at least twice told his officers his men were not murderers , Major Carrasco said .
2007_05_15_1847534	16	During the proceedings on Monday , Colonel Chessani sat quietly in the courtroom gallery , taking notes .
2007_05_15_1847534	17	Brian J. Rooney , one of Colonel Chessani 's lawyers , said the Time magazine questions had been reviewed and passed down to Colonel Chessani from senior Marine commanders who should have made any decision to investigate the deaths . ''
2007_05_15_1847534	18	By that point , the wheels were in motion above Chessani 's level , '' Mr. Rooney said in a telephone interview . ''
2007_05_15_1847534	19	It 's higher 's responsibility , '' he went on , referring to the division and other superior levels of command in Iraq at the time , '' to investigate a law-of-war violation . ''
2007_05_15_1847535	0	The search for three missing American soldiers abducted after an attack south of Baghdad continued Monday as the Qaeda group that claimed responsibility for the ambush said the soldiers would never be found . ''
2007_05_15_1847535	1	What you are doing searching for your soldiers will be in vain and lead to nothing but fatigue and unrest , '' said a statement posted on jihadist Web sites by the Islamic State of Iraq , an umbrella insurgent group that includes Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia . ''
2007_05_15_1847535	2	Your soldiers are in our hands .
2007_05_15_1847535	3	If you desire safety do not look for them . ''
2007_05_15_1847535	4	The statement suggested that the group was reveling in a manhunt that required a hefty deployment of resources at a time when Congress has pressed the American military to show progress here by September .
2007_05_15_1847535	5	About 4,000 American soldiers have been scouring the orchards and villages near Mahmudiya , a predominantly Sunni Arab farming town where the attack occurred early Saturday morning .
2007_05_15_1847535	6	A similar search involving 8,000 soldiers last June for two American soldiers captured in a town nearby forced commanders to cancel or delay operations in other parts of Iraq until after they were found dead four days later .
2007_05_15_1847535	7	On Monday , the American military reported the deaths of four American soldiers , a marine and an airman throughout Iraq .
2007_05_15_1847535	8	Maj. Gen. William B. Caldwell IV , the top military spokesman in Baghdad , said Monday that the search effort would continue .
2007_05_15_1847535	9	Of the four American soldiers and one Iraqi soldier who died in the ambush , he said in a statement , one American was still unidentified . ''
2007_05_15_1847535	10	We are using every asset and resource available to the United States and our Iraqi allies in these efforts , '' he said .
2007_05_15_1847535	11	He confirmed that American officials believe '' Al Qaeda or an affiliate group '' engineered the abduction .
2007_05_15_1847535	12	He said it took 56 minutes for reinforcements to arrive at the scene of the ambush because the first and second units sent to assist discovered roadside bombs along the way .
2007_05_15_1847535	13	He also said that '' elements of the same unit '' that was attacked heard the initial explosion at 4:44 a.m. , suggesting that the two Humvees burned at the scene had not been traveling alone .
2007_05_15_1847535	14	Typically , American convoys include at least three vehicles .
2007_05_15_1847535	15	Two Iraqi security officials in the area , speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to reporters , said that five Humvees were on a rural road in predawn darkness when a roadside bomb exploded near the fourth , setting it ablaze .
2007_05_15_1847535	16	As gunmen stormed the fifth Humvee , abducting the three soldiers , the first three vehicles continued on .
2007_05_15_1847535	17	American military officials did not confirm the account .
2007_05_15_1847535	18	Procedures for handling attacks vary ; some commanders tell units to drive through ambushes and call for backup .
2007_05_15_1847535	19	The statement from the Islamic State of Iraq was its second regarding Saturday 's attack , and it called the war in Iraq '' a competition , '' according to a translation by the Site Institute , which tracks jihadist Web sites .
2007_05_15_1847535	20	The abduction , it suggested , was an effort to even the score after General Caldwell 's announcement earlier this month that American troops had killed Muharib Abdul Latif al-Jubouri , a senior leader of Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia .
2007_05_15_1847535	21	It went on to cite the rape last year of a teenage girl by American troops near where the abduction occurred .
2007_05_15_1847535	22	A similar statement was issued during the search for the two American soldiers captured in June .
2007_05_15_1847535	23	It came from the Mujahedeen Shura Council , an umbrella insurgent group that was a precursor to the Islamic State of Iraq and included Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia .
2007_05_15_1847535	24	It was released roughly a month after a four-day search led to the discovery of the soldiers ' bodies on a booby-trapped road a few miles from where they had been abducted .
2007_05_15_1847535	25	In a sign of what might be to come , that statement accompanied a video that showed the soldiers ' mutilated bodies wearing tattered green Army uniforms .
2007_05_15_1847535	26	One of the soldiers in the video had been decapitated .
2007_05_15_1847535	27	The area south of Baghdad where both abductions of soldiers occurred , known as the '' triangle of death , '' has been perpetually difficult for the American military to control .
2007_05_15_1847535	28	Sheik Ali al-Hatim , the leader of the Dulaimi tribe in Mahmudiya , said the ambush on Monday bore the hallmarks of another coordinated assault on American troops -- an attack in January in Karbala by gunmen dressed in fake American military uniforms .
2007_05_15_1847535	29	One soldier was killed and four were kidnapped and later found dead . ''
2007_05_15_1847535	30	A number of parties are involved in this -- Al Qaeda and other militias , '' he said . ''
2007_05_15_1847535	31	The situation in the area where the incident took place is very dangerous .
2007_05_15_1847535	32	Al Qaeda has been knocking on people 's doors and telling them that their sons between the ages of 20 and 30 must join their organization . ''
2007_05_15_1847535	33	He said the Americans have detained at least 50 people in the search .
2007_05_15_1847535	34	One of the senior Iraqi Army officials in the area who described the attack said that fighting between American troops and Qaeda fighters had broken out in a few places since the search began and that at least two gunmen had been killed and about 100 people arrested , including an older man who may have died while in custody .
2007_05_15_1847535	35	The American deaths on Monday were concentrated in and around the capital .
2007_05_15_1847535	36	Two of the soldiers were killed by gunmen while on a foot patrol southeast of Baghdad , the United States military said .
2007_05_15_1847535	37	A third soldier was killed and four were wounded by a roadside bomb in a northern part of the capital .
2007_05_15_1847535	38	An airman was killed and three other airmen were wounded by a roadside bomb in southern Baghdad .
2007_05_15_1847535	39	A marine died during combat in Anbar Province , and a fourth soldier died of nonhostile causes .
2007_05_15_1847536	0	The Department of Defense has identified 3,382 American service members who have died since the start of the Iraq war .
2007_05_15_1847536	1	It confirmed the deaths of following Americans yesterday : BACEVICH , Andrew J. , 27 , First Lt. , Army ; Walpole , Mass. ; First Cavalry Division .

2007_05_15_1847537	1	From now on , it is simply a question of perfecting that knowledge . ''
2007_05_15_1847537	2	MOHAMED ELBARADEI , the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency , on Iran 's progress with uranium .
2007_05_15_1847538	0	Nine years after they exchanged vows at a huge , lavishly choreographed news conference in London , Daimler and Chrysler signed their divorce papers Monday at a sparsely attended briefing in an auditorium at an aging Mercedes-Benz factory here .
2007_05_15_1847538	1	As bookends , the two news conferences vividly illustrated the dashed dreams of the Daimler-Chrysler marriage .
2007_05_15_1847538	2	At least for one partner , though , the sale of Chrysler to Cerberus Capital Management represents a potentially invigorating emancipation .
2007_05_15_1847538	3	Daimler , now largely free of its struggling American partner , can look ahead to what analysts generally agree is a promising future as a stand-alone maker of trucks and luxury cars . ''
2007_05_15_1847538	4	I 'm very optimistic , '' said Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley in London . ''
2007_05_15_1847538	5	Daimler is the largest truck company in the world and one of the most valuable premium car companies in the world . ''
2007_05_15_1847538	6	The price of freedom for the soon-to-be-renamed Daimler A.G. is $ 677 million in cash -- its out-of-pocket outlay in the $ 7.4 billion transaction -- for Cerberus to take Chrysler off its hands .
2007_05_15_1847538	7	It is also shedding nearly $ 18 billion in health care and pension liabilities .
2007_05_15_1847538	8	For a merger once valued at $ 36 billion , it was a humiliating comedown .
2007_05_15_1847538	9	Nor are Chrysler 's long-term prospects clear .
2007_05_15_1847538	10	Cerberus dispatched its chairman , John W. Snow , the former secretary of the Treasury , to Stuttgart to drum up excitement about Chrysler 's future and to reassure managers and workers that the investment firm is not going to turn Chrysler inside out .
2007_05_15_1847538	11	Among Daimler executives here , however , there was a sense that they got the good end of the bargain .
2007_05_15_1847538	12	The company 's businesses -- trucks , buses and luxury cars -- are among the fastest-growing and most profitable segments in the industry .
2007_05_15_1847538	13	And Mercedes-Benz , after a period in which it suffered from quality concerns and eroding profits , is on an upswing . ''
2007_05_15_1847538	14	There are more people with higher incomes , '' said Garel Rhys , director of the Center for Automotive Industry Research at Cardiff University in Wales , '' and they are living longer , so they have time to buy these cars . ''
2007_05_15_1847538	15	Though it will become much smaller , Daimler will have a stronger balance sheet , a hoard of cash and a clear focus . ''
2007_05_15_1847538	16	The new Daimler will stand on a very solid foundation , '' the chief executive , Dieter Zetsche , said .
2007_05_15_1847538	17	None of this dispelled a palpable sense of regret on the part of Mr. Zetsche , who made his reputation running Chrysler and even lent his image to television commercials for its vehicles .
2007_05_15_1847538	18	The company will retain a 19.9 percent stake in Chrysler . ''
2007_05_15_1847538	19	We obviously overestimated the potential of synergies , '' Mr. Zetsche said of the 1998 merger . ''
2007_05_15_1847538	20	I do n't know if any amount of due diligence could have given us a better estimate in that regard . ''
2007_05_15_1847538	21	Daimler , he said , was not able to exploit the combination of its highly engineered Mercedes-Benz luxury cars with the mass-market vehicles of Chrysler because American motorists could not , or would not , pay a premium for a Chrysler equipped with Mercedes technology .
2007_05_15_1847538	22	What Daimler encountered instead were the unforgiving vagaries of the American car market .
2007_05_15_1847538	23	Chrysler lost $ 1.5 billion last year , and the losses are expected to continue this year .
2007_05_15_1847538	24	Finally , Mr. Zetsche said , DaimlerChrysler could no longer bear the pressure on its profits or share price .
2007_05_15_1847538	25	DaimlerChrysler stock closed up nearly 2 percent in Frankfurt trading on Monday , after jumping as much as 7.8 percent when news of the agreement with Cerberus was reported .
2007_05_15_1847538	26	It has risen 25 percent since Mr. Zetsche disclosed in February that the company was considering alternatives , including a divestiture .
2007_05_15_1847538	27	Mr. Zetsche insisted that Chrysler did not drain cash from Mercedes .
2007_05_15_1847538	28	Despite its recent losses , it generated nearly $ 15 billion in cumulative profits during the years it was owned by Daimler .
2007_05_15_1847538	29	But analysts said Daimler could have found better uses for the cash it poured into Chrysler . ''
2007_05_15_1847538	30	They spent about $ 60 billion acquiring , restructuring and investing in Chrysler over the last nine years , '' Mr. Jonas of Morgan Stanley said . ''
2007_05_15_1847538	31	Just think where the next $ 60 billion could go if it was invested properly . ''
2007_05_15_1847538	32	Among other things , he said , Mercedes-Benz could introduce more innovative and alluring cars to compete with German brands like BMW and Audi .
2007_05_15_1847538	33	BMW , which has taken the mantle of the world 's top luxury carmaker in recent years , may feel new heat from its old rival .
2007_05_15_1847538	34	Daimler 's residual stake in Chrysler means that it will continue to have close ties to the company .
2007_05_15_1847538	35	For all the difficulties between Mercedes and Chrysler , Mr. Zetsche said they had successfully cooperated in developing power trains , buying raw material and sharing logistics systems .
2007_05_15_1847538	36	That work will go on , under the aegis of a joint automotive council .
2007_05_15_1847538	37	Mr. Zetsche portrayed the arrangement as a benefit , because Daimler will be able to capitalize on cost savings or new products that flow out of its collaboration without bearing health care liabilities . ''
2007_05_15_1847538	38	We basically have all the upside potential without the downside risk , '' Mr. Zetsche said .
2007_05_15_1847538	39	Still , Daimler 's history as a minority shareholder is problematic .
2007_05_15_1847538	40	In 1999 , it bought a stake in Mitsubishi Motors of Japan , thinking that the Japanese carmaker would be the third leg of its global stool .
2007_05_15_1847538	41	Management turmoil led Daimler to take control of Mitsubishi in 2002 , and by 2004 , it ended the alliance .
2007_05_15_1847538	42	Keeping a stake in Chrysler could also subject Daimler to criticism at home if the new owner takes radical steps .
2007_05_15_1847538	43	German companies that dispose of operations can be vulnerable to charges of antisocial behavior , as the engineering giant Siemens learned last year when it sold its cellular phone operation to a Taiwan company , which later shut it down .
2007_05_15_1847538	44	Some analysts maintain that Daimler 's 19.9 percent stake will be temporary -- a sort of umbilical cord for Chrysler 's new proprietor .
2007_05_15_1847538	45	Executives at Cerberus said Monday that they welcomed Daimler 's continuing investment , viewing it as a way to '' secure the transaction . ''
2007_05_15_1847538	46	Mr. Snow and others from Cerberus sought to allay fears that they planned wholesale changes at Chrysler .
2007_05_15_1847538	47	The firm has no immediate plans for layoffs , Mr. Snow said .
2007_05_15_1847538	48	And he disputed suggestions that Chrysler 's unionized workers had something to fear from Cerberus . ''
2007_05_15_1847538	49	It 's a mistake to think private equity companies are antagonistic , '' Mr. Snow said in a brief interview . ''
2007_05_15_1847538	50	Companies that do n't have the support of their workers ca n't be successful . ''
2007_05_15_1847538	51	Mr. Snow said the deal was a landmark for private equity firms '' in that this great symbol of American industry is returning to American shores , to American hands ; that 's important . ''
2007_05_15_1847538	52	Other executives at Cerberus attributed their success in the bidding to their firm 's 51 percent stake in the General Motors Acceptance Corporation , G.M. 's lending arm .
2007_05_15_1847538	53	That investment , they said , gave Cerberus familiarity with the details of automotive finance .
2007_05_15_1847538	54	They also credited the participation of Wolfgang Bernhard , a former president of Chrysler , who advised on the bid .
2007_05_15_1847538	55	Mr. Bernhard still has close ties with Mr. Zetsche , for whom he worked at Chrysler .
2007_05_15_1847538	56	For its part , DaimlerChrysler said it was swayed by the fact that Cerberus could arrange financing and move swiftly to close the deal .
2007_05_15_1847538	57	While Mr. Zetsche said the price tag was important , it was one of several factors in choosing the Cerberus offer over rival bids by the Blackstone Group , another private equity firm , and Magna International , a Canadian auto supplier .
2007_05_15_1847538	58	Daimler 's payments swell from $ 650 million to $ 1.5 billion if one includes $ 878 million for the company 's redemption of long-term bondsissued by Chrysler .
2007_05_15_1847538	59	Bodo Uebber , Daimler 's chief financial officer , said it did not consider that part of the cost of the transaction because it would have had to redeem the bonds eventually .
2007_05_15_1847538	60	As Chrysler passes into private hands , Mr. Zetsche said he planned to stay in touch with its chief , Thomas W. LaSorda , to learn the tricks of managing under the gaze of private equity investors . ''
2007_05_15_1847538	61	It 's always important that you learn in your life , '' he said .
2007_05_15_1847539	0	Terrell Owens stood in front of his locker on Monday -- the final day of the Dallas Cowboys ' minicamp -- and described the difference between playing for Wade Phillips , the new coach , and Bill Parcells , who rarely spoke to Owens or even mentioned him by name . ''
2007_05_15_1847539	1	I think everybody knows he 's a laid-back coach , a little different than Bill , '' Owens said . ''
2007_05_15_1847539	2	I do n't think you have to be a disciplinarian to get your point across .
2007_05_15_1847539	3	We 're going to win for him . ''
2007_05_15_1847539	4	Welcome to the new Dallas Cowboys , where the authoritative Parcells has been replaced by the more affable Phillips , and where most players seem eager to embrace the change .
2007_05_15_1847539	5	So excited was Owens to impress his new boss , he participated in all three days of minicamp , despite off-season finger surgery that was expected to limit or prevent his participation .
2007_05_15_1847539	6	But the bigger question in Dallas is not whether Owens , the mercurial wide receiver , will play effectively for Phillips , but whether the Cowboys will be playing postseason games next January or early February .
2007_05_15_1847539	7	The current 10-year drought without a playoff victory is the longest in franchise history , and the way last season ended for Dallas was particularly painful -- with quarterback Tony Romo mishandling the snap on a potential game-winning field goal during a playoff loss to the Seattle Seahawks .
2007_05_15_1847539	8	For the Cowboys ' owner , Jerry Jones , not winning a Super Bowl for 11 years has been much harder to take than not a winning playoff game . ''
2007_05_15_1847539	9	The last playoff game we won was Super Bowl XXX , so that 's what I think about , and that kind of reflects my philosophy , '' said Jones , sitting in his office , where the franchise 's five Super Bowl trophies are prominently displayed . ''
2007_05_15_1847539	10	I do n't live my days walking around here , singing the blues about not winning a playoff game in 10 years .
2007_05_15_1847539	11	I walk around singing the blues that I have n't won a Super Bowl in 10 years . ''
2007_05_15_1847539	12	With Parcells retired , even more of the responsibility for the Cowboys ' future rests on Jones , and the Phillips , a 59-year-old native of Orange , Tex. , getting perhaps his last chance as a N.F.L. head coach .
2007_05_15_1847539	13	Entering his 31st year in the league as either a head coach or an assistant , Phillips has distinguished himself as a defensive coordinator , most recently with the San Diego Chargers .
2007_05_15_1847539	14	But Phillips has yet to prove he can also be an outstanding head coach .
2007_05_15_1847539	15	While some players in Dallas may be glad that Parcells retired , he was a proven winner with two Super Bowl rings , and nobody doubted how badly he wanted to win . ''
2007_05_15_1847539	16	Coach Parcells knows how to put a team together , '' defensive end Jason Ferguson said . ''
2007_05_15_1847539	17	He puts so much time and energy into it , it wears him down .
2007_05_15_1847539	18	In the end , he just felt it was time to go . ''
2007_05_15_1847539	19	Parcells 's frosty relationship with Owens may have made it less palatable for Parcells to return .
2007_05_15_1847539	20	Asked Monday what he learned from his time with Parcells , Owens said , '' Nothing really . ''
2007_05_15_1847539	21	Asked Monday if he signed Owens against Parcells 's wishes last season , Jones evaded the question . ''
2007_05_15_1847539	22	Our relationship far exceeded any expectations that I ever had , and it was a great working relationship , '' Jones said of working with Parcells . ''
2007_05_15_1847539	23	We did n't always agree on things .
2007_05_15_1847539	24	But because it was as good as it was , I 'm not going to get into the specifics of when we agreed , or when we disagreed . ''
2007_05_15_1847539	25	Jones thought Phillips was a perfect fit , because the Cowboys already used a 3-4 defense , and Phillips coached the 3-4 in San Diego last season , helping the Chargers to a 14-2 regular-season record .
2007_05_15_1847539	26	The players have quickly taken to Phillips 's defensive system , which they said gave them more leeway than Parcells 's did . ''
2007_05_15_1847539	27	Now we 'll be attacking teams , and hopefully it will lead to second-and-longs , more sacks , '' Ferguson said .
2007_05_15_1847539	28	But as the head coach , Phillips must also deal with Owens .
2007_05_15_1847539	29	Phillips has heard skeptics who wonder how he will handle Owens the first time he becomes unhappy .
2007_05_15_1847539	30	Phillips said he believed their relationship will last . ''
2007_05_15_1847539	31	I 'm a little bit laid-back , but they know when I 'm upset , '' Phillips said . ''
2007_05_15_1847539	32	That 's the key , that you 'll tell them the truth , and that if they 're not working hard , they 'll respond .
2007_05_15_1847539	33	I 've never had a problem with a player as a head coach or as an assistant coach .
2007_05_15_1847539	34	I treat them right , and I expect the same from them . ''
2007_05_15_1847539	35	How long the good feelings last will be fuel for debate , but for the time being , locker room drama has taken a back seat to clowning .
2007_05_15_1847539	36	As Phillips was holding his Monday news conference , cornerback Terence Newman snuck into the back of the room , pulled a hat down low to cover his face , and asked a question from the back of the room . ''
2007_05_15_1847539	37	Coach , '' Newman said , '' have you thought about giving the players the rest of the afternoon off ? ''
2007_05_15_1847539	38	Yes , the atmosphere with the Cowboys has undoubtedly become looser .
2007_05_15_1847539	39	But will Jones and Phillips still be smiling in January ? ''
2007_05_15_1847539	40	I like our talent here , I wanted to be a head coach again , and the Cowboys job is about as prestigious as you can get , '' Phillips said . ''
2007_05_15_1847539	41	I thought I could win here .
2007_05_15_1847539	42	We 'll find out . ''
2007_05_15_1847540	0	He comes from a long line of unionized autoworkers , but Thomas W. LaSorda 's collar is unmistakably white .
2007_05_15_1847540	1	As chief executive of Chrysler for the last two years , he has spoken of the benefits of sending work to Mexico .
2007_05_15_1847540	2	He has signed off on a plan to cut Chrysler 's work force by 13,000 and close all or part of four plants by 2009 .
2007_05_15_1847540	3	And now he has proclaimed his confidence that private equity can rescue Chrysler , despite serious reservations among the rank and file . ''
2007_05_15_1847540	4	Tom is the chief executive officer , '' said Basil E. Hargrove , the president of the Canadian Automobile Workers union , who has known Mr. LaSorda 's family for decades . ''
2007_05_15_1847540	5	I was under no illusions about what that meant .
2007_05_15_1847540	6	It meant that he was a guy we could talk to .
2007_05_15_1847540	7	But it did n't mean there would n't be cutbacks or layoffs . ''
2007_05_15_1847540	8	His family 's history has been tightly bound to Chrysler 's since before he was born .
2007_05_15_1847540	9	His grandfather , Harry Rooney , helped organize Chrysler workers in Windsor , Ontario , in the 1940s , despite the company 's attempts to throw him in jail .
2007_05_15_1847540	10	Mr. LaSorda 's mother , Bea , used to stand watch for Chrysler company men as her father signed up workers in their basement .
2007_05_15_1847540	11	Frank LaSorda , Thomas 's father , also a Chrysler employee , eventually became president of the same Windsor union local that his father-in-law helped start .
2007_05_15_1847540	12	In all , three generations of LaSordas and Rooneys have been union leaders , electricians , janitors and line workers at Chrysler .
2007_05_15_1847540	13	Thomas LaSorda , who as a teenager worked on the assembly line but has otherwise spent his entire career on the business side of the auto industry , has vowed to '' turn over all the rocks '' at Chrysler to determine where cuts can be made .
2007_05_15_1847540	14	Now he has a new management team looking over his shoulder that will want to see that those cuts are made as efficiently as possible .
2007_05_15_1847540	15	Chrysler said yesterday that Cerberus Capital Management , the New York private equity firm , was buying a controlling stake for $ 7.4 billion .
2007_05_15_1847540	16	Mr. LaSorda must now answer to a board that he could find even more impatient than DaimlerChrysler has been . ''
2007_05_15_1847540	17	Private equity is not a benevolent association , '' said David E. Cole , chairman of the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor , Mich. '' You know where these guys come from .
2007_05_15_1847540	18	It 's an association of people who have dedicated themselves to making money . ''
2007_05_15_1847540	19	Mr. LaSorda seemed to send a signal to workers yesterday that Cerberus was not buying Chrysler to slash and burn it . ''
2007_05_15_1847540	20	There are no new job cuts planned in connection with this transaction , '' he said in a written statement .
2007_05_15_1847540	21	Some experts said that being bought by a private equity firm with considerable liquidity gives Chrysler -- and Mr. LaSorda -- some time . ''
2007_05_15_1847540	22	This is not a buy and dump situation , '' said George Magliano , director of North American automotive research for Global Insight . ''
2007_05_15_1847540	23	There 's got to be some patience here . ''
2007_05_15_1847540	24	Thomas T. Stallkamp , a former Chrysler president who is now a partner in the New York private equity firm Ripplewood Holdings , said that Cerberus appears to be willing to give Mr. LaSorda a shot at running the company . ''
2007_05_15_1847540	25	I think he 's gotten a little bit of a reprieve , and maybe he can run his own show , '' Mr. Stallkamp said . ''
2007_05_15_1847540	26	I think that 's the way most private equity firms operate .
2007_05_15_1847540	27	They do n't come in and parachute in new management right away .
2007_05_15_1847540	28	He 's been fettered by being under the wing of DaimlerChrysler bureaucracy , so they 're going to see what he can do on his own . ''
2007_05_15_1847540	29	If the deal goes through , Mr. LaSorda is entitled to severance benefits worth $ 4.26 million for leaving the DaimlerChrysler board -- twice the sum of his salary and annual bonus , according to an analysis of securities filings by James F. Reda and Associates .
2007_05_15_1847540	30	Mr. LaSorda 's pension will also be bolstered by two extra years of service credit .
2007_05_15_1847541	0	In the last year , private equity firms have broken the mold over and over again .
2007_05_15_1847541	1	They have bought technology and finance companies , previously thought unsuitable for buyouts .
2007_05_15_1847541	2	The deals have gotten bigger ; the financing more creative .
2007_05_15_1847541	3	But with an agreement to take control of Chrysler , private equity is venturing into virtually uncharted territory . ''
2007_05_15_1847541	4	Private equity can go anyplace , '' said Wilbur Ross , who has also invested in businesses once thought off limits .
2007_05_15_1847541	5	Sure , private equity firms have bought troubled industrial companies in the past .
2007_05_15_1847541	6	And they have dealt with unionized work forces .
2007_05_15_1847541	7	But no one has tried to grapple with a company with the problems the size of Chrysler 's and with a union as powerful as the United Automobile Workers .
2007_05_15_1847541	8	Perhaps more important , every move by its new private owners will come under intense scrutiny .
2007_05_15_1847541	9	Chrysler is a symbolic American brand , one recognized worldwide .
2007_05_15_1847541	10	And private equity , which has bought name companies from Toys '' R '' Us to Univision and accounted for a fifth of the record $ 3.8 trillion in deals worldwide last year , has itself come under an increasingly harsh spotlight , as Congress discusses tax changes and the public gasps at the enormous wealth of executives .
2007_05_15_1847541	11	The private equity firm taking on the challenge , Cerberus Capital Management , based in New York , made its name on its hard-charging negotiating style in the rough-and-tumble world of distressed-debt investing .
2007_05_15_1847541	12	The firm has invested in troubled companies that it believed could benefit from rigorous cost-cutting and operational controls .
2007_05_15_1847541	13	Its portfolio includes the Formica Corporation , the Mervyns department store chain and a controlling interest in GMAC , General Motors ' financing arm .
2007_05_15_1847541	14	Cerberus has worked with unions in the past .
2007_05_15_1847541	15	In 2004 , Cerberus led a group that took control of Air Canada , only months after the airline 's management had rebuffed its advances .
2007_05_15_1847541	16	Its window of opportunity opened when its main rival in the bidding , the billionaire Victor Li , withdrew his offer .
2007_05_15_1847541	17	Labor groups opposed efforts by Mr. Li -- who apparently did not meet with the unions -- to cut costs at the struggling airline .
2007_05_15_1847541	18	Cerberus then stepped in , eventually winning over Air Canada management and unions .
2007_05_15_1847541	19	Still the firm may yet find a challenging sparring partner in the U.A.W. , said Harley Shaiken , a professor of labor relations at the University of California , Berkeley . ''
2007_05_15_1847541	20	Chrysler has a scale that exceeds much of what they 've done before , '' he said . ''
2007_05_15_1847541	21	It 's dealing with unions that remain very powerful at the company and within the industry . ''
2007_05_15_1847541	22	Yesterday , however , the deal received polite applause from Solidarity House , the U.A.W. 's headquarters in Detroit , as well as from Wall Street and Frankfurt .
2007_05_15_1847541	23	The agreement , and the support from the union , represents a '' big breakthrough '' for private equity , said Mr. Ross , who has invested in many troubled manufacturing companies over the years .
2007_05_15_1847541	24	As recently as a year and a half ago , '' Detroit was n't at all sure it liked the idea of private equity coming in , '' Mr. Ross said . ''
2007_05_15_1847541	25	That 's obviously gone by the board . ''
2007_05_15_1847541	26	Private equity 's seemingly unstoppable wave has been fed in large part by the pension funds of unionized workers .
2007_05_15_1847541	27	Big pension funds of public employees like Calpers are among the biggest institutional investors in private equity firms , and public pension money accounted for about a quarter of all new money raised by private equity last year , according to the publication Private Equity Analyst .
2007_05_15_1847541	28	Among the investors in Cerberus are the Los Angeles Fire and Police Pension System and the Pennsylvania Public School Employees , according to the research firm Capital IQ .
2007_05_15_1847541	29	So far , however , American pension funds have expressed little desire to take up an activist mantle .
2007_05_15_1847541	30	Calpers , for example , has publicly criticized companies over issues like executive compensation .
2007_05_15_1847541	31	But absent direct threats to the jobs of its members , the pension fund said that it would not take more drastic action . ''
2007_05_15_1847541	32	Our bottom line is performance , '' said Clark McKinley , a Calpers spokesman . ''
2007_05_15_1847541	33	We do n't get directly involved with the funds . ''
2007_05_15_1847541	34	Others in organized labor say that unions could do more in using the influence of their pension funds . ''
2007_05_15_1847541	35	Pension funds can be enormously influential in calling for investments that are both fair and can provide returns , '' said Stephen Lerner , assistant to the president of the Service Employees International Union , a politically active group that represents nearly two million workers .
2007_05_15_1847541	36	( The S.E.I.U. itself has only a few small pension funds , he added . )
2007_05_15_1847541	37	The S.E.I.U. has recently been vocal about its concerns over buyouts , but Mr. Lerner said that the union was not inherently hostile to private equity .
2007_05_15_1847541	38	In Europe , big buyouts have received a harsher reception .
2007_05_15_1847541	39	In Britain , the GMB Union has protested job cuts at companies like the Automobile Association , and a leading German politician once referred to private equity firms as '' locusts . ''
2007_05_15_1847541	40	Until now , private equity firms have taken little heat for jumping into distressed , highly unionized industries .
2007_05_15_1847541	41	Starting in 2002 , Mr. Ross 's firm began rolling the remains of five bankrupt steel companies into the International Steel Group , which he later sold to Mittal Steel for a tenfold profit .
2007_05_15_1847541	42	More recently , Mr. Ross 's firm and others have been buying assets from bankrupt auto parts makers .
2007_05_15_1847541	43	Like Chrysler , many of these companies also had substantial legacy liabilities related to pensions and health care .
2007_05_15_1847541	44	But unlike Chrysler , they were often sold as part of a bankruptcy case , which offers a way to void collective bargaining agreements -- a power that serves as a kind of '' nuclear option '' in what are often hard-fought negotiations with unions .
2007_05_15_1847541	45	( Last year , the auto parts maker Delphi , which is under Chapter 11 protection , threatened to ask a bankruptcy judge to cancel its labor contracts .
2007_05_15_1847541	46	In response , members of the United Automobile Workers voted to give their union permission to call a strike .
2007_05_15_1847541	47	Cerberus , meanwhile , is expected to withdraw from a group seeking to buy a controlling interest in Delphi . )
2007_05_15_1847541	48	Cerberus , by contrast , is buying Chrysler outside of bankruptcy , which brings a different dynamic to the negotiation process .
2007_05_15_1847541	49	Seeking court permission to break labor agreements is not an option .
2007_05_15_1847541	50	And considering the large investment Cerberus plans to make in Chrysler , it has ample reason to avoid a bankruptcy filing .
2007_05_15_1847541	51	The threat of bankruptcy , however remote , is bound to be a shadow player as Cerberus and the U.A.W. turn to the issue of health care liabilities , said Daniel L. Keating , a vice dean at Washington University School of Law in St. Louis , who called the health care issue '' the 10-ton gorilla on the cost side . ''

2007_05_15_1847545	0	A United Nations human rights official said he was barred from visiting an immigration detention center in New Jersey yesterday .
2007_05_15_1847545	1	It was the second time he was denied access to an American immigration jail on a weeklong monitoring tour .
2007_05_15_1847545	2	The official , Jorge Bustamante , the United Nations special rapporteur on the human rights of migrants , said he was informed over the weekend that his visit to detained immigrants in the Monmouth County Correctional Institution in Freehold , scheduled for yesterday , had been canceled .
2007_05_15_1847545	3	Mr. Bustamante said he had received no explanation .
2007_05_15_1847545	4	Mr. Bustamante was barred from a May 7 visit to the T. Don Hutto Family Detention Center in Taylor , Tex. , where illegal immigrant families , including children , are held .
2007_05_15_1847545	5	Officials of Immigration and Customs Enforcement , the federal agency in charge of that center , said they canceled the visit because of a pending lawsuit over conditions there by the American Civil Liberties Union .
2007_05_15_1847545	6	In a letter of protest yesterday to Zalmay Khalilzad , the United States ambassador to the United Nations , Mr. Bustamante said the State Department had approved his itinerary . ''
2007_05_15_1847545	7	My interpretation is that someone in the United States government is not proud of what is happening in those centers , '' Mr. Bustamante said in an interview .
2007_05_15_1847545	8	A department spokesman , Bill Strassberger , said he understood that the New Jersey visit was canceled by the Monmouth County sheriff , Joseph W. Oxley .
2007_05_15_1847545	9	Mr. Strassberger confirmed that the State Department had helped arrange Mr. Bustamante 's tour and was disappointed the two visits had not taken place . ''
2007_05_15_1847545	10	We want to show we have nothing to hide , '' Mr. Strassberger said .
2007_05_15_1847545	11	Undersheriff Cynthia Scott , a spokeswoman for Sheriff Oxley , said Mr. Bustamante had canceled his visit , declining to accept '' reasonable conditions '' for access . ''
2007_05_15_1847545	12	It was canceled by him , not us , '' she said .
2007_05_15_1847545	13	Mr. Bustamante was able to visit a federal immigration detention center in Florence , Ariz. .
2007_05_15_1847545	14	He said it appeared clean and '' well managed . ''
2007_05_15_1847546	0	House Democratic leaders , against stiff resistance in their caucus , have decided to advance a measure to require federal lobbyists to disclose the campaign contributions they collect and bundle for federal political candidates , officials involved in their deliberations said .
2007_05_15_1847546	1	The Democratic leaders plan to outline the proposal at a closed caucus meeting on Tuesday .
2007_05_15_1847546	2	The proposal , a version of which has already passed the Senate , could have a major effect on the business of politics in Washington , creating a new category of public disclosure that goes to the heart of how lobbyists ingratiate themselves with lawmakers .
2007_05_15_1847546	3	Because campaign finance laws cap individual contributions , candidates depend heavily on people who act as surrogate fund-raisers by collecting and bundling checks from friends , clients and associates .
2007_05_15_1847546	4	For incumbent lawmakers , lobbyists are often eager to play such a role .
2007_05_15_1847546	5	Current campaign laws require only the disclosure of individual contributions , including those in bundles , not the role played by the bundler .
2007_05_15_1847546	6	Many lawmakers privately oppose adding new disclosure requirements because it could impose a new burden on potential fund-raisers .
2007_05_15_1847546	7	But voting against anything labeled ethics and lobbying reform can be politically awkward .
2007_05_15_1847546	8	The Democratic leaders ' decision to push forward is a major step toward the proposal 's passage because they have committed to bring the bundling disclosure measure up for a vote on the floor , probably as an amendment to a lobbying reform bill .
2007_05_15_1847546	9	Representative Chris Van Hollen , the Maryland Democrat who is in charge of the House Democratic campaign effort for 2008 , is drafting the amendment .
2007_05_15_1847546	10	The Democratic leaders appear to have yielded to members ' private resistance against another lobbying-rule provision that would have impaired the ability of lawmakers to earn big salaries on K Street after leaving office .
2007_05_15_1847546	11	Speaking anonymously because the proposals are confidential until presented to the caucus , officials involved in developing them said the Democratic leaders had not decided to match a Senate bill that bars lawmakers from engaging in any '' lobbying activity '' for two years after leaving office .
2007_05_15_1847546	12	Current '' revolving door '' rules bar former members from directly lobbying for one year .
2007_05_15_1847546	13	Lobbying firms are usually glad to hire a former member to act as an adviser or strategist for one year , but imposing a two-year wait could lower the fees such firms would pay .
2007_05_15_1847546	14	Representative Rahm Emanuel , the Illinois Democrat who is chairman of the House Democratic Conference , declined to comment on the details of the proposal .
2007_05_15_1847546	15	But he said that the rule changes showed Democrats following through on an issue that helped them last fall . ''
2007_05_15_1847546	16	They basically said , ` oh , this is an individual issue , it is not an issue for the institution , ' and it became a problem for their party , '' Mr. Emanuel said .
2007_05_15_1847546	17	Fred Wertheimer , a long-time advocate of tighter ethics rules , said the bundling disclosure proposal was the central part of the bill . ''
2007_05_15_1847546	18	You ca n't avoid bundling disclosure and claim that you are addressing the lobbying scandals that occurred in the last Congress , '' Mr. Wertheimer said .
2007_05_15_1847547	0	The private Kamehameha Schools in Hawaii announced yesterday that they had settled a civil rights lawsuit brought against them by a student denied admission because he did not possess Hawaiian ancestry .
2007_05_15_1847547	1	The settlement avoided the possibility of a decision by the United States Supreme Court on the status of Native Hawaiians .
2007_05_15_1847547	2	The terms of the settlement , between the schools and a student identified only as John Doe , were not disclosed .
2007_05_15_1847547	3	But it left in place an 8-to-7 decision of the federal appeals court in San Francisco that allows the schools to admit only students who can prove that at least one of their ancestors lived on the Hawaiian Islands in 1778 , when the British explorer Capt. James Cook arrived .
2007_05_15_1847547	4	The Supreme Court had considered whether to hear the case four times but had not reached a decision by Friday , when the parties informed the court of the settlement .
2007_05_15_1847547	5	The case was dismissed the same day .
2007_05_15_1847547	6	The schools are the beneficiaries of the enormous legacy of a 19th-century Hawaiian princess , Bernice Pauahi Bishop , who intended them to raise the educational level of Native Hawaiians .
2007_05_15_1847547	7	Their endowment exceeds $ 6 billion .
2007_05_15_1847547	8	They have an enrollment of some 6,700 students , from preschool through 12th grade , with campuses on three islands and preschools throughout the state .
2007_05_15_1847547	9	Admission is a great prize , as older students pay about $ 3,000 in annual tuition for an education worth more than $ 20,000 .
2007_05_15_1847547	10	The student in the suit dismissed Friday had initially sued to gain admission to the schools , but he has since graduated , making that aspect of his case moot .
2007_05_15_1847547	11	The settlement presumably includes a payment to him and his lawyers .
2007_05_15_1847547	12	In a letter released yesterday , the schools ' trustees said the decision to settle was a difficult one . ''
2007_05_15_1847547	13	We can not ignore the treacherous landscape before us , '' the trustees wrote . ''
2007_05_15_1847547	14	It is becoming increasingly clear that this lawsuit is only one piece of a much broader risk to the rights of Native Hawaiians , as the indigenous people of this state , to manage and control our resources . ''
2007_05_15_1847547	15	Eric Grant , a lawyer for the student , said in a e-mail message that he had no immediate comment on the settlement .
2007_05_15_1847547	16	The settlement does not preclude further suits challenging the admissions policy , but it could take years for another suit to reach the Supreme Court again , and there is , of course , no guarantee that the court would agree to hear it .
2007_05_15_1847547	17	In its decision in December , the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that students without Hawaiian ancestry could be denied admission to the schools based on their race without running afoul of a civil rights law .
2007_05_15_1847547	18	The majority cited what it said were unique factors in the history of Hawaii , the plight of Native Hawaiians and the schools ' distinctively remedial mission . ''
2007_05_15_1847547	19	The schools are a wholly private K-12 educational establishment , whose preferential admissions policy is meant to counteract the significant , current educational deficits of Native Hawaiian children in Hawaii , '' Judge Susan P. Graber wrote for the majority .
2007_05_15_1847547	20	In a dissent joined at least in part by six other judges , Judge Jay S. Bybee said the schools ' worthy mission nonetheless violated '' the Supreme Court 's requirements for a valid affirmative action plan . ''
2007_05_15_1847548	0	For the fourth time in a row , the Supreme Court on Monday decided a death penalty case by a vote of 5 to 4 .
2007_05_15_1847548	1	But this time , contrary to the court 's overturning of three Texas death sentences last month , a narrow majority went the other way and reinstated the death sentence of an Arizona man who argued that his lawyer had failed to discover or present crucial evidence that could have persuaded the jury to spare his life .
2007_05_15_1847548	2	The issue before the justices was a step removed from the ultimate question of whether the defendant , Jeffrey T. Landrigan , had been deprived of his constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel .
2007_05_15_1847548	3	Rather , the case presented an issue of habeas corpus law : whether the Federal District Court in Phoenix had properly dismissed Mr. Landrigan 's habeas corpus petition as so insubstantial as not even to deserve a hearing .
2007_05_15_1847548	4	The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled last year that the district court 's action was an '' abuse of discretion '' and ordered it to grant Mr. Landrigan a hearing .
2007_05_15_1847548	5	Arizona appealed that ruling to the Supreme Court .
2007_05_15_1847548	6	Writing for the majority on Monday , Justice Clarence Thomas said that Mr. Landrigan 's case was extremely weak and that the district court had been '' well within its discretion '' to conclude that even with the benefit of a hearing , he would not be able to show that the lawyer 's performance had made a difference to the outcome of the sentencing hearing .
2007_05_15_1847548	7	Under the Supreme Court 's precedents , such a showing of '' prejudice '' from a lawyer 's deficient performance is essential to a claim of deprivation of the Sixth Amendment 's guarantee of the effective assistance of counsel .
2007_05_15_1847548	8	In a dissenting opinion , Justice John Paul Stevens said the majority 's conclusion about the weakness of the case was based on '' pure guesswork '' and a '' parsimonious appraisal of a capital defendant 's constitutional right to have the sentencing decision reflect meaningful consideration of all relevant mitigating evidence . ''
2007_05_15_1847548	9	Justice Anthony M. Kennedy voted with Justice Thomas and the three other conservative justices in the majority : Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Antonin Scalia and Samuel A. Alito Jr. .
2007_05_15_1847548	10	In the three Texas death penalty decisions last month , Justice Kennedy provided a crucial fifth vote to the liberal side of the court : Justice Stevens along with Justices David H. Souter , Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer .
2007_05_15_1847548	11	But the Texas cases , focusing on jury instructions , presented a different set of issues .
2007_05_15_1847548	12	Justice Kennedy 's vote in the latest case , far from being inconsistent with his past opinions , was in fact fully consistent with his vote two years ago in a case that presented a similar question of a lawyer 's competence in a death penalty case .
2007_05_15_1847548	13	In that case , Rompilla v. Beard , a 5-to-4 majority found , over Justice Kennedy 's vigorous dissent , that a defense lawyer 's failure to investigate possible mitigating evidence fell below acceptable standards .
2007_05_15_1847548	14	The new element that determined the outcome of the latest case , Schriro v. Landrigan , No. 05-1575 , was therefore not Justice Kennedy 's vote but that of the newest member of the court , Justice Alito .
2007_05_15_1847548	15	As an appeals court judge , he was the author of the decision that the Supreme Court overturned in the Rompilla case .
2007_05_15_1847548	16	His predecessor on the Supreme Court , Justice Sandra Day O'Connor , voted with the majority to overturn that decision .
2007_05_15_1847548	17	She had expressed mounting concern about the death penalty in general and about the quality of representation for death-row inmates in particular .
2007_05_15_1847548	18	As in the abortion case the court decided last month , in which Justice Alito 's vote with the 5-to-4 majority determined the outcome , the latest case underscores the difference that his presence on the court can be expected to make in various doctrinal areas .
2007_05_15_1847548	19	With respect to the death penalty in particular , the decision may indicate that the court is turning away from a clear trend of increased scrutiny of the performance of defense lawyers .
2007_05_15_1847548	20	Mr. Landrigan had escaped from a prison in Oklahoma , where he was serving a 20-year sentence for murder , when he committed a second murder , this time in Arizona .
2007_05_15_1847548	21	He was a difficult defendant in the courtroom , repeatedly interrupting his lawyer and making self-incriminating statements .
2007_05_15_1847548	22	At the sentencing hearing after his conviction , he refused to permit his mother and his former wife to testify on his behalf .
2007_05_15_1847548	23	When the judge asked if he had anything to say , he replied : '' I think if you want to give me the death penalty , just bring it right on .
2007_05_15_1847548	24	I 'm ready for it . ''
2007_05_15_1847548	25	It was this behavior that Justice Thomas said overshadowed any deficiencies in the defense lawyer 's preparation of the mitigation case . ''
2007_05_15_1847548	26	The mitigating evidence he seeks to introduce would not have changed the result , '' Justice Thomas said .
2007_05_15_1847548	27	Further , he said , the state appeals court , in rejecting Mr. Landrigan 's appeal , reasonably concluded that he had waived the right to present mitigating evidence .
2007_05_15_1847548	28	Justice Stevens objected that , as the appeals court found , there was substantial mitigating evidence , including a diagnosis of brain damage and mental illness , that had never come out at the hearing because the lawyer had failed to conduct an adequate investigation of his client 's background .
2007_05_15_1847548	29	Justice Stevens said the court should not assume that Mr. Landrigan had waived the right to present evidence of which he was unaware .
2007_05_15_1847548	30	In any event , Justice Stevens said , Mr. Landrigan was '' at least entitled to an evidentiary hearing . ''

2007_05_15_1847551	0	Connecticut 's highest court became the first in the nation on Monday to hear arguments over whether the establishment of civil unions created a fundamentally inferior status for gays and lesbians .
2007_05_15_1847551	1	But in pondering a new appeal for same-sex marriage , the State Supreme Court 's seven justices also focused on another fundamental question : whether laws that make distinctions based on sexual orientation , like those governing marriage , merit scrutiny similar to that given laws that discriminate based on race or gender .
2007_05_15_1847551	2	Connecticut is one of four states -- along with Vermont , New Jersey and , most recently , New Hampshire -- that have established civil unions for same-sex couples .
2007_05_15_1847551	3	Only Massachusetts authorizes marriages for gays .
2007_05_15_1847551	4	Other states , like California , have similar benefits for domestic partnership .
2007_05_15_1847551	5	Two years after the General Assembly here established civil unions , the Supreme Court has agreed to decide whether they fulfill the state 's constitutional obligation to treat couples equally .
2007_05_15_1847551	6	Jane R. Rosenberg , the assistant attorney general who argued the case for the state , told the court that gay marriage was a policy question that should be left up to legislators and not determined by '' court fiat . '' ''
2007_05_15_1847551	7	Is the legislature constitutionally required to use the word ` marriage ' when it 's referring to the package of rights and benefits it has given to same-sex couples ? ''
2007_05_15_1847551	8	Ms. Rosenberg asked in court . ''
2007_05_15_1847551	9	The answer is clearly no . ''
2007_05_15_1847551	10	But Bennett Klein , the lead lawyer for the eight couples bringing the suit , argued in court that there were several parallels between racial discrimination lawsuits and the legal battle for gay marriage .
2007_05_15_1847551	11	Marriage is '' something that goes to the heart of equal protection , '' Mr. Klein said during his closing argument , adding that gay couples have '' the right to be part of the fabric of society when they are just the same as other couples and other families . ''
2007_05_15_1847551	12	Besides potentially breaking new ground on whether homosexuals deserve the same level of legal protection as blacks and women , the case is being closely watched because it presents more complicated arguments than have other cases regarding civil unions and marriage .
2007_05_15_1847551	13	In New Jersey , where the Legislature created civil unions in February to fulfill a Supreme Court mandate for equal treatment , many couples have complained that they are being denied rights and benefits granted married couples , and are considering a lawsuit similar to the one here .
2007_05_15_1847551	14	Four of the eight couples in the Connecticut case have had civil unions performed in the state , and the others have held out for marriage .
2007_05_15_1847551	15	The case is being handled by Gay and Lesbian Advocates and Defenders , the same group that successfully sued for marriage in Massachusetts .
2007_05_15_1847551	16	Though some state legislatures have created specific legal protections for gays in their laws against hate crimes or discrimination in housing or employment , there is no precedent in federal or the highest state courts making gays what is known in jurisprudence as a '' suspect class , '' like racial minorities , a category that is accorded strict legal scrutiny when laws are challenged in court .
2007_05_15_1847551	17	That issue was the focus of much of the three hours of argument on Monday .
2007_05_15_1847551	18	The judges repeatedly asked Mr. Klein and Ms. Rosenberg whether they believed gays and lesbians had a history of long-term discrimination and political powerlessness , two elements in establishing a suspect class .
2007_05_15_1847551	19	Ms. Rosenberg acknowledged that homosexuals have long been treated as inferior but said it would be difficult to say they are politically powerless in Connecticut , pointing to the civil union law passed by the General Assembly in 2004 without pressure from the courts as evidence .
2007_05_15_1847551	20	She added that it was possible that the legislature would approve same-sex marriage within the next several years .
2007_05_15_1847551	21	( The Joint Judiciary Committee passed a same-sex marriage bill last month , 27 to 15 , but legislative leaders announced Friday that they did not have enough votes in the House to pass it , so it will not come to the floor for a vote this year . )
2007_05_15_1847551	22	Justice Richard N. Palmer , who was appointed by Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. , an independent , noted that African-Americans had made advances over the last several decades but were still considered politically powerless when many discrimination cases made their way through court .
2007_05_15_1847551	23	Then he turned to Ms. Rosenberg and asked : '' Is that your argument : Give them more time and they 'll do better ? '' ''
2007_05_15_1847551	24	Yes , '' Ms. Rosenberg replied .
2007_05_15_1847551	25	Noting the stall in the legislature on the same issue , Justice Flemming L. Norcott Jr. , also appointed by Governor Weicker , said , '' If they were doing better , they would have passed that bill across the street , '' prompting a wave of laughter through the packed courtroom , which is across the street from the State Capitol .
2007_05_15_1847551	26	If the court found that gays and lesbians were a suspect class , the state would be required to prove that it had rational basis for making a distinction between homosexual and heterosexual couples .
2007_05_15_1847551	27	In many ways , the arguments were complicated by the fact that civil unions officially bestow the same legal protections as marriage , and one judge referred to marriage itself as an '' intangible '' benefit . ''
2007_05_15_1847551	28	We 're talking about a word here , '' Ms. Rosenberg said . ''
2007_05_15_1847551	29	All those benefits , at least under state law , have been granted . ''
2007_05_15_1847551	30	But Mr. Klein retorted that '' marriage is not just a bunch of legal rights . '' ''
2007_05_15_1847551	31	It is a status that the state confers on people , '' he said . ''
2007_05_15_1847551	32	A status that has profound personal meaning to individuals . ''
2007_05_15_1847551	33	Correction : May 19 , 2007 , Saturday An article on Tuesday about a case before the Connecticut Supreme Court that questions whether civil unions for same-sex couples fulfill the state 's constitutional obligation to treat individuals equally misidentified the legal standard that would be applied if the court found that gay men and lesbians were a '' suspect class , '' a status , like membership in a racial minority , that makes laws that categorize on that basis suspect .
2007_05_15_1847551	34	The standard is '' heightened scrutiny , '' which requires the state to prove that discrimination against gay men and lesbians is related to an important or compelling government interest ; it is not '' rational basis , '' a more relaxed standard in which the state is required to show only that it had such a basis for making a distinction between single-sex and heterosexual couples .
2007_05_15_1847552	0	Even seasoned New Yorkers may be unfamiliar with Jersey Street .
2007_05_15_1847552	1	It 's more alley than avenue , tucked between Mulberry and Lafayette Streets like a quaint movie-set reminder of old Manhattan .
2007_05_15_1847552	2	But those who do know the block 's history will tell you that No. 10 was where the Hawley & Hoops candy factory churned out chocolate cigarettes and cigars starting in the late 19th century .
2007_05_15_1847552	3	Now , that brick-and-steel building , built in 1886 , has been reincarnated as something neighborhood residents have wanted for years : a new library .
2007_05_15_1847552	4	The 87th branch in the New York Public Library system , it is to open in a public ceremony at 3 p.m. Monday . ''
2007_05_15_1847552	5	What we tried to do was bring a sophisticated library to a sophisticated community , '' said Paul LeClerc , the library system 's president and chief executive . ''
2007_05_15_1847552	6	I think the fact that it is in a historic building -- not in a new structure -- is important .
2007_05_15_1847552	7	It reminds people of the industrial history of that community . ''
2007_05_15_1847552	8	The Mulberry Street branch , as it will be known , has been long in coming .
2007_05_15_1847552	9	Design work started nearly six years ago , right around 9/11 , but the renovation did not begin until the fall of 2004 .
2007_05_15_1847552	10	It will be the first new library branch in Manhattan since 1989 , and the first ever in SoHo .
2007_05_15_1847552	11	For the architecture firm Rogers Marvel , the project 's challenges were considerable .
2007_05_15_1847552	12	Much of the space , which was most recently occupied by a store , is below ground -- only one floor is at street level -- so planners had to design what is essentially a deep basement without making it feel like a basement .
2007_05_15_1847552	13	The budget was limited : $ 6.1 million for 12,000 square feet .
2007_05_15_1847552	14	The entrance had to be accessible to the handicapped , but the sidewalk was too narrow for ramps to be added at street level .
2007_05_15_1847552	15	The architects tried to turn the drawbacks into opportunities .
2007_05_15_1847552	16	They obtained permission from the city 's Department of Transportation to raise the entire sidewalk , allowing room for a ramp to the entrance and permitting fresh air to flow underneath to the lower level .
2007_05_15_1847552	17	Lights beaming up through sidewalk grills now illuminate the entryway .
2007_05_15_1847552	18	While the building 's nooks , crannies and idiosyncrasies were something of a nightmare for the contractors , the architects made the most of them by carving out inviting reading areas .
2007_05_15_1847552	19	To accommodate pipes on the second level , the level just below the street , they lowered the ceiling and created a cozy story-hour corner with comfortable upholstered chairs .
2007_05_15_1847552	20	In the space for older children on that level , the architects installed clear glass to give young visitors a front-row seat on Manhattan bedrock . ''
2007_05_15_1847552	21	We wanted a Harry Potter dungeonlike atmosphere , '' said Jonathan Marvel , one of the principal architects . ''
2007_05_15_1847552	22	So daytime or nighttime , you always feel like there 's some mysterious thing going on outside . ''
2007_05_15_1847552	23	In the central stairwell , they designed a staircase that allows the light to filter down from the street .
2007_05_15_1847552	24	The path of the staircase is indirect , requiring visitors to walk around as well as up and down .
2007_05_15_1847552	25	This reinforced the architects ' theme of circulation -- of air , light , people and books . ''
2007_05_15_1847552	26	You ca n't go directly to the next level ; you have to wind your way around through bridges and landings , '' Mr. Marvel said . ''
2007_05_15_1847552	27	It plays up the process of discovery -- what book do you want to find ? ''
2007_05_15_1847552	28	Above the third and lowest level , the architects used an existing opening as an overlook so visitors could gaze down upon what Mr. Marvel calls the building 's '' crown jewel '' : the old boiler vault , now the main reading room .
2007_05_15_1847552	29	Anchored by the original cast-iron columns , this space , the library 's largest , has an industrial grandeur , with the warmth of an exposed brick wall juxtaposed with the cool concrete floor . ''
2007_05_15_1847552	30	We wanted this to feel like a college library , where you could get lost in the stacks , '' Mr. Marvel said . ''
2007_05_15_1847552	31	We did n't want you to feel 30 feet below grade . ''
2007_05_15_1847552	32	In honoring the surrounding area 's original aesthetic , the architects were able to save money on materials . ''
2007_05_15_1847552	33	SoHo is a cast-iron and masonry neighborhood , and all those materials are reflected in this space , '' Mr. Marvel said .
2007_05_15_1847552	34	The staircase is made of industrial steel and concrete with mahogany handrails and perforated stainless-steel guardrails .
2007_05_15_1847552	35	The brick walls have been washed and left as is .
2007_05_15_1847552	36	The architects could have installed new flooring but instead refinished the original oak . ''
2007_05_15_1847552	37	We wanted to save them in their beat-up and sloping nature , '' Mr. Marvel said . ''
2007_05_15_1847552	38	It adds character and patina that you ca n't get from a new floor . ''
2007_05_15_1847552	39	They arranged the children 's information desks around the original steel columns in a doughnut formation .
2007_05_15_1847552	40	They used the existing arcade of granite piers to shape the young adult space and filled it with movable cushy chairs on casters designed to be practically indestructible . ''
2007_05_15_1847552	41	It was a clear-cut case of the existing architecture becoming the inspiration for how the space was configured , '' Mr. Marvel said .
2007_05_15_1847552	42	For the street-level floor , which features new books and the checkout counter , the architects turned one of the old ceiling beams into a rustic desk for the computer station .
2007_05_15_1847552	43	To encourage people to hang out with their newspapers or laptops -- the library is wired for Internet access -- the architects lined the room with banquette seating .
2007_05_15_1847552	44	Mr. Marvel said the layout of long wooden benches was inspired by the old Staten Island Ferry . ''
2007_05_15_1847552	45	As museums have become co-opted by gift shops and high prices for entry , '' Mr. Marvel said , libraries and bookstores have reasserted their role as public gathering spaces . ''
2007_05_15_1847552	46	This is truly a neighborhood library , '' he said . ''
2007_05_15_1847552	47	While SoHo has become an outdoor mall , here 's a place for respite from the battles between art and commerce . ''
2007_05_15_1847552	48	Correction : May 18 , 2007 , Friday An article on Tuesday about a new branch of the New York Public Library on Jersey Street on the edge of SoHo referred imprecisely to the street .
2007_05_15_1847552	49	It runs from Mulberry Street past Lafayette Street to Crosby Street -- not just from Mulberry to Lafayette , the block where the library is located .
2007_05_15_1847553	0	Griping about subway service is practically a vocation for many New Yorkers .
2007_05_15_1847553	1	Yet it often goes hand in hand with the conviction that no matter how much they complain , no one is ever likely to listen .
2007_05_15_1847553	2	But now the man who runs the city 's subways and buses says that he actually wants to hear their complaints .
2007_05_15_1847553	3	Howard H. Roberts Jr. , appointed last month as president of New York City Transit , said yesterday that one of his first major initiatives would be a system of rider report cards for subways and buses .
2007_05_15_1847553	4	Riders on each line will be asked to grade different aspects of service , including the cleanliness of cars and stations , safety and the responsiveness of employees .
2007_05_15_1847553	5	He said he would also ask riders to list the three things that they thought most need to be improved . ''
2007_05_15_1847553	6	I want to know what passengers want , '' Mr. Roberts said yesterday during a wide-ranging interview that touched on topics as diverse as dirty subway cars and his affinity for the poetry of Robert Frost . ''
2007_05_15_1847553	7	I think too often people sit around in offices like this and say , ` O.K. , I know better than the customer what it is they want and so this is what we 're going to do . '
2007_05_15_1847553	8	I want the customer to drive the priorities . ''
2007_05_15_1847553	9	The first report cards could appear this summer on the No. 7 line , Mr. Roberts said .
2007_05_15_1847553	10	He envisions cards that would be handed out to riders as they exit stations , and which they could fill out and mail in at no cost .
2007_05_15_1847553	11	By the fall , he said , he hopes to bring the report cards to every line in the system , and bus lines as well .
2007_05_15_1847553	12	Mr. Roberts said that he did not expect to be able to respond with a single solution that would work for all lines . ''
2007_05_15_1847553	13	It may very well be that different subway lines in the city will have different priorities , '' he said . ''
2007_05_15_1847553	14	If it 's cleanliness on the 6 line and it 's security on the A line , those are the things that have to be my first priorities on their lines . ''
2007_05_15_1847553	15	Mr. Roberts declined to say how he would fill out one of the report cards , but he had his own complaints about cleanliness .
2007_05_15_1847553	16	He said that he too often found cars that were dirty and full of trash when riding the subway to work as early as 4:30 a.m. .
2007_05_15_1847553	17	Mr. Roberts had been on the job less than two weeks when Daniel Boggs , a track worker , was struck and killed by a No. 3 train near Columbus Circle on April 24 .
2007_05_15_1847553	18	Five days later , Marvin Franklin , another track worker , was struck and killed by a G train at a station in Brooklyn .
2007_05_15_1847553	19	Mr. Roberts , as transit chiefs have in the past , promptly began a comprehensive safety review .
2007_05_15_1847553	20	But he did it in a very visible partnership with Roger Toussaint , the president of Local 100 of the Transport Workers Union .
2007_05_15_1847553	21	That cooperation has contrasted with the tense relations between labor and management that prevailed in recent years at the agency .
2007_05_15_1847553	22	To a large extent , the tone had already been set by Elliot G. Sander , the executive director of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority , who hired Mr. Roberts to succeed Lawrence G. Reuter , who retired .
2007_05_15_1847553	23	But in choosing Mr. Roberts , Mr. Sander knew that he was hiring someone with a history of getting along with labor leaders -- a history that had not always worked out well for Mr. Roberts .
2007_05_15_1847553	24	This is Mr. Roberts 's second stint at the transit agency , and he is now in the unusual position of having been hired to run an organization where he was once fired .
2007_05_15_1847553	25	He first came to work there in 1981 , as vice president for finance and then as the vice president in charge of buses .
2007_05_15_1847553	26	He was fired in 1986 .
2007_05_15_1847553	27	Mr. Roberts said that it was a result of his closeness to the labor unions .
2007_05_15_1847553	28	Mr. Roberts , who is 67 , went on to work at Citibank , where he said he first saw customer report cards used to improve service .
2007_05_15_1847553	29	He worked from 1989 to 1997 at the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority , the transit system for the Philadelphia area , where he used similar report cards .
2007_05_15_1847553	30	Mr. Roberts 's formative years were spent in the Army .
2007_05_15_1847553	31	He graduated from West Point and then served for 20 years , retiring as a colonel .
2007_05_15_1847553	32	Mr. Roberts said that the Army taught him about honor and duty ; then he handed a reporter a sheet of paper with the final stanza of a Robert Frost poem , '' Two Tramps in Mud Time . ''
2007_05_15_1847553	33	The poem is a meditation on the things a person does out of necessity and the things he does because he chooses to , and Mr. Roberts said he planned to have the stanza posted on his office wall .
2007_05_15_1847553	34	The poem says , in part : '' My object in living is to unite/My avocation and my vocation/As my two eyes make one in sight . '' ''
2007_05_15_1847553	35	That sort of describes why this job means as much to me as it does , '' Mr. Roberts said . ''
2007_05_15_1847553	36	Very few of us get to combine our vocation and our avocations and very few of us get to play for mortal stakes , and soldiers and doctors and leaders of transportation organizations and a very few other people do that . ''
2007_05_15_1847555	0	Lawyers for the three detectives charged in the shooting death of Sean Bell complained yesterday that prosecutors are withholding evidence they say they are entitled to -- including eyewitness accounts -- that could help their clients .
2007_05_15_1847555	1	Detectives Marc Cooper , Gescard F. Isnora and Michael Oliver returned to State Supreme Court in Queens yesterday under heightened security after reports of a specific threat against Detective Oliver .
2007_05_15_1847555	2	At the hearing , the defense lawyers submitted to prosecutors a three-page list of documents they had not received .
2007_05_15_1847555	3	Prosecutors have broad discretion to decide what documents contain exculpatory material , forcing a routine legal tug of war , said Philip E. Karasyk , who is defending Detective Isnora . ''
2007_05_15_1847555	4	It 's like having the fox guarding the chicken coop , '' he said .
2007_05_15_1847555	5	Late in April , prosecutors handed over 2,100 pages of evidence in Mr. Bell 's shooting , as well as videotapes and CD-ROMs .
2007_05_15_1847555	6	But defense lawyers said many documents were missing , including the grand jury testimony of Officer Michael Carey and Detective Paul Headley , who fired shots during the Nov. 25 , 2006 , confrontation but were not indicted .
2007_05_15_1847555	7	Also missing , they said , were the names and addresses of witnesses to the shooting .
2007_05_15_1847555	8	Mr. Bell , 23 , was leaving Club Kalua with friends after his bachelor party , unaware that they were being followed by an undercover officer who believed that one of them may have been armed .
2007_05_15_1847555	9	In the confrontation that followed , five officers fired 50 shots at the men 's car , killing Mr. Bell and wounding the other men , Joseph Guzman , 31 , and Trent Benefield , 23 .
2007_05_15_1847555	10	No gun was found in the car .
2007_05_15_1847555	11	Detectives Oliver and Isnora are both charged with first - and second-degree manslaughter , charges that could bring up to 25 years in prison , as well as additional lesser charges .
2007_05_15_1847555	12	Detective Cooper is charged with two counts of reckless endangerment , which could bring a sentence of a year in prison .
2007_05_15_1847555	13	The hearing was subdued compared with previous court dates , which have drawn demonstrators and crowds of spectators .
2007_05_15_1847555	14	The Rev. Al Sharpton was not present on Monday , nor was Mr. Guzman , who was not feeling well , his lawyer said .
2007_05_15_1847555	15	For the first time , several rows of seats at the back of the courtroom were mostly empty .
2007_05_15_1847555	16	But the threat against Detective Oliver , who fired 31 of the 50 shots , did dictate a change in security : The three detectives were led into the courthouse separately , through an entrance normally reserved for the district attorney .
2007_05_15_1847555	17	The threat was a credible one , though it was made by a prisoner , said Michael J. Palladino , president of the Detectives ' Endowment Association . ''
2007_05_15_1847555	18	Let me say , the threat definitely raises my level of concern , '' he said . ''
2007_05_15_1847555	19	You have to take the threat seriously . ''
2007_05_15_1847555	20	There had also been a shift in one of the legal teams : Detective Isnora , the undercover officer who followed Mr. Bell and his friends from Club Kalua , has added Anthony L. Ricco , a veteran trial lawyer , to his defense .
2007_05_15_1847555	21	Mr. Ricco recently won an acquittal for Lt. Shamik Walton , a police officer who shot and killed a tenant during an argument while off duty .
2007_05_15_1847555	22	He also defended the Brooklyn Democratic leader Clarence Norman Jr. against corruption charges , and Rudy Fleming , who shot Nicole duFresne , 28 , a playwright and actress , during a mugging . ''
2007_05_15_1847555	23	I admire him , '' said Mr. Karasyk , who collaborated with Mr. Ricco on the Walton case . ''
2007_05_15_1847555	24	We want to have as many heads on this thing as possible . ''
2007_05_15_1847555	25	Justice Arthur J. Cooperman set a deadline of June 22 for defense motions , which will probably include a motion to dismiss or reduce the charges in the case .
2007_05_15_1847555	26	Defense lawyers may also file motions to sever the three cases from one another , or waive the right to a jury trial .
2007_05_15_1847555	27	Justice Cooperman adjourned the case until Sept. 7 .
2007_05_15_1847556	0	Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg came to the Capitol on Monday to pitch his plan for reducing traffic congestion in Manhattan to state lawmakers and Gov. Eliot Spitzer , but there is no apparent sense of urgency in Albany to move on the mayor 's complex environmental proposals .
2007_05_15_1847556	1	The mayor is proposing dozens of environmental projects and regulations to prepare New York City for a projected surge of one million additional residents by 2030 .
2007_05_15_1847556	2	Under the most contentious proposal , known as congestion pricing , the city would charge $ 8 for cars and $ 21 for commercial trucks that enter Manhattan below 86th Street from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. on weekdays , or $ 4 for drivers within Manhattan , with several exceptions .
2007_05_15_1847556	3	The plan , similar to a program in London , calls for the revenue to be used to finance environmental and mass transportation projects . ''
2007_05_15_1847556	4	This is a plan about trying to solve problems of success , '' the mayor said . ''
2007_05_15_1847556	5	Just listen to the radio in the morning , '' he added . ''
2007_05_15_1847556	6	There 's an hour wait to get on the G. W. Bridge , there 's a 45 minute wait to get to the Lincoln Tunnel , 55 minutes for the Holland Tunnel .
2007_05_15_1847556	7	Think about , No. 1 , the pollution that gets put in the air , but think of the economic value of somebody that commutes . ''
2007_05_15_1847556	8	Although Mr. Bloomberg 's visit was ostensibly about the environment , there was also considerable talk around the Statehouse on Monday about whether he might run for governor or president since term limits require him to leave office at the end of 2009 .
2007_05_15_1847556	9	Enough interest , indeed , that Mr. Bloomberg tried to dismiss such questions before reporters could even ask them .
2007_05_15_1847556	10	Given the more than 900 '' days left in this job -- and I 'm not running for governor and I 'm not running for president -- the time to do this is now , '' he said during a news conference .
2007_05_15_1847556	11	The mayor made the rounds with a number of environmental and health groups , including Environmental Defense and the American Cancer Society .
2007_05_15_1847556	12	After meeting with the governor in the late afternoon , Mr. Bloomberg said , '' I 'm optimistic that we 'll find a way to get his support , but his staff wants to look at it first , obviously . ''
2007_05_15_1847556	13	State officials were noncommittal .
2007_05_15_1847556	14	The governor 's staff and Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver reiterated that three weeks after the plan was unveiled , they were reviewing it and had yet to take a position on it .
2007_05_15_1847556	15	More enthusiastic was the Senate majority leader , Joseph L. Bruno , who said the mayor , a fellow Republican , made an '' outstanding presentation '' to Senate Republicans . ''
2007_05_15_1847556	16	We 're going to look forward to working with the mayor on the details of the plan , '' he said . ''
2007_05_15_1847556	17	The general reception was very upbeat , very positive , because what benefits New York City benefits all of New York State . ''
2007_05_15_1847556	18	Mr. Bruno also pointed out that the mayor 's proposal was not to be confused with the income-based commuter tax that expired in 1999 , which Mr. Bruno had opposed .
2007_05_15_1847556	19	But the landscape of opposition for the plan is still considerable . ''
2007_05_15_1847556	20	My colleagues and I feel like our folks are taxed enough and tolled enough and fee-ed enough under the present scenario , '' said Senator John J. Flanagan , a Long Island Republican . ''
2007_05_15_1847556	21	So why would we want to do anything more that 's going to take more money out of their pocket ? ''
2007_05_15_1847556	22	Senator Eric T. Schneiderman , a Manhattan Democrat , called the plan '' a very hard sell , but I think the mayor is making a very good case and that he 's put together the coalition he needs if he 's going to get this done . ''
2007_05_15_1847556	23	Mr. Bloomberg 's visit coincided with the start of a three-day global climate conference in the city , in which he will be host with former President Bill Clinton .
2007_05_15_1847556	24	At the conference , which is drawing international business and municipal leaders , a number of cities , including Los Angeles and Toronto , are expected to announce plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
2007_05_15_1847556	25	Mr. Clinton is also expected to announce an arrangement through his foundation 's Climate Initiative to help cities reduce emissions .
2007_05_15_1847556	26	The conference focuses on cities because they are responsible for three-quarters of the world 's energy consumption , organizers say .
2007_05_15_1847556	27	Mr. Bloomberg , who welcomed delegates to Gracie Mansion on Monday night , was scheduled to address the conference on Tuesday in a speech that was to be translated simultaneously into several languages , offering him a global platform for his plan to guide the city 's growth .
2007_05_15_1847556	28	It will also give him an opportunity to hammer a pet theme of late : that urban mayors are in the best position to enact problem-solving policies , whether fighting illegal gun trafficking or global warming .
2007_05_15_1847556	29	Mr. Bloomberg 's push for his plan , which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent by 2030 , came as Environmental Defense and the Partnership for New York City , a business group , released a television advertisement over the weekend showing belching smokestacks , an asthmatic child visiting the doctor and lines of traffic , while urging New Yorkers to '' act now '' and '' make a difference '' by supporting Mr. Bloomberg 's plan .
2007_05_15_1847557	0	To the prosecution , it was a sinister crime that a troubled but calculating man committed against one terrified woman .
2007_05_15_1847557	1	But to a defense psychologist , Peter Braunstein 's attack on a former colleague in the fashion press was a symbolic attack on the hypocrisy of the fashion industry and of American society .
2007_05_15_1847557	2	He saw himself as a '' hit man for God , '' the psychologist , Barbara R. Kirwin , told a Manhattan jury yesterday in State Supreme Court . ''
2007_05_15_1847557	3	He 's an avenging angel , a special person who has been chosen to right hypocrisies . ''
2007_05_15_1847557	4	His paranoid fantasy began as an urge for revenge against a woman who dumped him , Dr. Kirwin said , but it grew into a need to punish a morally corrupt society . ''
2007_05_15_1847557	5	Now it had assumed cosmic proportions , '' Dr. Kirwin said yesterday at Mr. Braunstein 's trial .
2007_05_15_1847557	6	He wanted revenge , she testified , '' against the fashion industry that was superficial , against post-9 / 11 hypocrisy , against firefighters as phony heroes , against a world that treats talented , sensitive people this way . ''
2007_05_15_1847557	7	Mr. Braunstein , 43 , charged with kidnapping and sexual abuse , is accused of dressing as a firefighter and setting off smoke bombs to gain entrance to the Chelsea apartment of a woman he hardly knew on Oct. 31 , 2005 .
2007_05_15_1847557	8	Once inside , he threatened her with a pellet gun and a knife , drugged her with a chloroform-soaked rag , stripped her , tied her to her bed and groped her for what the prosecutors said was 13 hours .
2007_05_15_1847557	9	The witness testified that Mr. Braunstein 's case was '' clearly the most textbook case of paranoid schizophrenia that I had ever seen . ''
2007_05_15_1847557	10	Dr. Kirwin went on to say that Mr. Braunstein had told her his attack on the woman was a '' fantasy , '' a '' comic book crime '' and a '' game . ''
2007_05_15_1847557	11	He told her it was not sexual , and said that '' at a certain point , I just lost it and became bored . ''
2007_05_15_1847557	12	His victim , who had been a co-worker in the fashion press , became a symbol of the vacuousness of that life to him , Dr. Kirwin said . ''
2007_05_15_1847557	13	I was a synthetic person , she was a synthetic person , '' Dr. Kirwin quoted Mr. Braunstein as saying .
2007_05_15_1847557	14	He incorporated elements of his fantasy life with a former girlfriend -- like sexual bondage -- into the crime , but did not realize his victim would object , the psychologist said .
2007_05_15_1847557	15	He said he was surprised the victim reported the crime to the police , Dr. Kirwin said . ''
2007_05_15_1847557	16	I thought we were playing a game , like ` Rashomon , ' '' she quoted Mr. Braunstein saying , adding that this was one of many inappropriate cultural references . ''
2007_05_15_1847557	17	I guess I knew it was a crime , but I did n't consider it wrong . ''
2007_05_15_1847557	18	As a further testimony to Mr. Braunstein 's being unaware of the seriousness of his crime , Dr. Kirwin described a note he left on the woman 's bathroom mirror after the attack , which read , '' Bye -- Hope things turn around for U soon . '' ''
2007_05_15_1847557	19	The note on the mirror reflects that he 's so out of touch that he does not know that he 's terrorized this woman for 12 hours , '' Dr. Kirwin said .
2007_05_15_1847557	20	One of the few points the defense is disputing is how long Mr. Braunstein held the woman captive , because the legal definition of kidnapping is more than 12 hours .
2007_05_15_1847557	21	Dr. Kirwin testified that Mr. Braunstein had showed signs of paranoid schizophrenia and '' downward drift '' since college .
2007_05_15_1847557	22	These alternated with periods of stability when he had easy jobs or when he was in relationships with strong women , like his former wife , Donna Keane ( they divorced in 1994 ) , and Debra Michals , a feminist historian , she said .
2007_05_15_1847557	23	But she said his job at Women 's Wear Daily and his relationship with Jane Larkworthy , the beauty editor of W magazine , had been too much of a '' pressure cooker , '' and had sent him over the edge .
2007_05_15_1847557	24	He perceived being fired from Women 's Wear Daily in October 2002 , and then being dumped by Ms. Larkworthy in November 2003 , as apocalyptic events , Dr. Kirwin said . ''
2007_05_15_1847557	25	It was very simply the end of his world as he knew it . ''
2007_05_15_1847557	26	In other action yesterday , Justice Thomas Farber ruled that prosecutors could not bring up portions of Mr. Braunstein 's writings in which he talked about serial killers like David Berkowitz ( the Son of Sam ) and the fictional Hannibal Lecter , and the Columbine school shootings .
2007_05_15_1847557	27	The defense argued that the jury could infer that Mr. Braunstein was a potential killer , even though he is not accused of murder .
2007_05_15_1847557	28	The judge ruled that the defense could use a statement from Mr. Braunstein 's manifesto where he talked about killing Anna Wintour , the editor of Vogue , because it fit into the context of his rage against the fashion industry .
2007_05_15_1847558	0	Miles and miles of bigger and stronger levees have been built along the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers since the deadly floods of 1993 , and millions of dollars have been spent on drainage improvements .
2007_05_15_1847558	1	Yet as the rush of water that caused the Missouri River to overflow its banks and submerge dozens of towns last week rolled toward St. Louis on Monday , attention was turned to a metropolitan region that since 1993 has seen runaway residential and commercial development in the rivers ' flood paths .
2007_05_15_1847558	2	About 28,000 homes have been built and more than 6,000 acres of commercial and industrial space developed on land that was underwater in 1993 , according to research by Nicholas Pinter , a geologist who studies the region at Southern Illinois University in Carbondale .
2007_05_15_1847558	3	Building is happening on flood plains across Missouri , but most of the development is in the St. Louis area , and it is estimated to be worth more than $ 2.2 billion .
2007_05_15_1847558	4	Though scientists warn about the danger of such building , the Missouri government has subsidized some of it through tax financing for builders . ''
2007_05_15_1847558	5	No one has really looked at the cumulative effect , '' said Timothy M. Kusky , a professor of natural sciences at St. Louis University , who calculates that there has been more development on the Missouri River flood plain in the years since 1993 than at any other time in the history of the region .
2007_05_15_1847558	6	The good news for St. Louis right now is that forecasters say the two rivers will crest well below their 1993 levels by Tuesday , sparing the area significant flooding .
2007_05_15_1847558	7	But many scientists remain concerned that the effect of the new construction , should a levee break , could eventually be even more severe flooding .
2007_05_15_1847558	8	Levees constrict a river 's path and raise its water level , which causes higher , faster flow .
2007_05_15_1847558	9	A flood plain , conversely , exists in nature to absorb a river 's overflow . ''
2007_05_15_1847558	10	The more levees we build , the higher we have to build them , '' Professor Kusky said . ''
2007_05_15_1847558	11	It 's a self-perpetuating problem . ''
2007_05_15_1847558	12	Still , people have been drawn to the area , assured by the sense of security the levees provide .
2007_05_15_1847558	13	Disincentives beyond the possibility of flooding seem to be few . ''
2007_05_15_1847558	14	This was absolutely a dodged bullet , '' Professor Pinter said . ''
2007_05_15_1847558	15	This could have been a very bad situation for St. Louis , but luckily it was a near-miss . ''
2007_05_15_1847558	16	People living in the flood plains are eligible for the National Flood Insurance Program or for any private insurance they can secure , though the private alternatives are increasingly difficult to obtain .
2007_05_15_1847558	17	And they are entitled to whatever federal disaster relief is offered to the state after a flood , be it temporary housing or buyouts , said Butch Kinerney , a spokesman for the Federal Emergency Management Agency .
2007_05_15_1847558	18	THF Realty Inc. used Missouri 's tax program , known as tax increment financing , to build what is said to be the largest strip mall in the country on land in the Chesterfield Valley area of St. Louis County that was submerged in the floods of 1993 .
2007_05_15_1847558	19	The shopping center , which cost $ 275 million to build , opened in 1999 and now has more than two million square feet of retail space , mall officials said .
2007_05_15_1847558	20	The developers spent more than $ 35 million on levee and storm drainage improvements , replacing an old levee that had offered protection against a 100-year flood with a levee that met the standards for a 500-year flood .
2007_05_15_1847558	21	And , they said , they have brought jobs and revenue to a formerly sleepy part of the county . ''
2007_05_15_1847558	22	We built the shopping center and interchange that opened the entire valley , '' said Marian Nunn , the chief operating officer of THF Realty . ''
2007_05_15_1847558	23	The difference is that the levee is maintained now , on top of being bigger , stronger and better .
2007_05_15_1847558	24	The risks are really substantially mitigated . ''
2007_05_15_1847558	25	The company was able to use the special financing because Missouri allows it for projects in areas that are considered blighted , or where development is not likely to occur without help . ''
2007_05_15_1847558	26	We will continue to build even more , '' Ms. Nunn said .
2007_05_15_1847558	27	Faith in the levees seems to trump other concerns here . ''
2007_05_15_1847558	28	We 're not even close to having any issues , '' said Brian McGownd , the deputy director of public works in Chesterfield .
2007_05_15_1847558	29	Of the new levee , Mr. McGownd said , '' We have 100 percent confidence that it 's done right , and the way it 's supposed to be , and that it will be a good , strong levee for many years . ''
2007_05_15_1847558	30	Fear of flooding did not appear to scare off prospective buyers at the New Town at St. Charles , a housing development whose sales office hummed with activity on Sunday , even as the Missouri River was rising .
2007_05_15_1847558	31	Although the community is near the confluence of the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers , residents are not required to have flood insurance , because they are beyond the 100-year flood plain .
2007_05_15_1847558	32	The location was a selling point for Ken Snider , a high school teacher from St. Louis . ''
2007_05_15_1847558	33	It 's not going to flood here for another 100 years , '' Mr. Snider said , '' and I wo n't be around by then . ''
2007_05_15_1847558	34	But critics of the developments say someone else is likely to be around then , and taxpayers in general will carry the tab after the next disaster bailout . ''
2007_05_15_1847558	35	If history tells us anything , it 's that levees once built eventually fail , '' Professor Pinter said . ''
2007_05_15_1847558	36	But instead of being farmland there , now it 's a strip mall or residential area , or a whole city . ''
2007_05_15_1847558	37	The floods of 1993 killed 38 people and caused $ 16 billion in damage across the Midwest .
2007_05_15_1847558	38	More than 500 counties were declared federal disaster areas .
2007_05_15_1847558	39	Adolphus A. Busch IV , a member of the Anheuser-Busch brewing family who helped found the Great Rivers Habitat Alliance in St. Louis in 2000 , is alarmed at the pace of development in the rivers ' paths after the 1993 flood . ''
2007_05_15_1847558	40	That was the milestone for us , '' Mr. Busch said . ''
2007_05_15_1847558	41	At that point the federal government came in and did major buyouts , and people said , ` Look , we 've learned our lesson : no more development . '
2007_05_15_1847558	42	Well , that lasted for about six or seven years . ''
2007_05_15_1847558	43	He continued , '' We always realized that there would be fringe development , but we never envisioned after 1993 that anyone would try to build major levees and enclose thousands of acres . ''
2007_05_15_1847558	44	Some people already living in the flood plain at the time of the last big flood now say that it just makes economic sense for them to stay close to the river , and that it is an issue of personal-risk calculation and property rights .
2007_05_15_1847558	45	Doris Hulst , a 65-year-old school bus driver , is the sole homeowner on a 109-acre swath of land that once housed three trailer parks near the Missouri River in St. Charles County . ''
2007_05_15_1847558	46	They all took the buyout , '' Mrs. Hulst said of her neighbors who relocated after the flood . ''
2007_05_15_1847558	47	I took the buyout on a trailer I owned across the street , but you did n't make enough money to buy anything decent . ''
2007_05_15_1847558	48	Today , Mrs. Hulst 's trailer is elevated on three rows of cinder blocks . ''
2007_05_15_1847558	49	We 'll be fine as long as the Mississippi does n't back up , '' she said .
2007_05_15_1847558	50	Alan Dooley , a spokesman for the Army Corps of Engineers , St. Louis District , said people , like water , had certain natural inclinations . ''
2007_05_15_1847558	51	People have a tendency to locate near water , '' Mr. Dooley said . ''
2007_05_15_1847558	52	These people vote ; they pay taxes .
2007_05_15_1847558	53	It 's kind of difficult to go through with a broad brush and say , ` You all ought to get out of here . ' ''
2007_05_15_1847559	0	New York and New Jersey have often been bit players in the presidential nominating process , with their primaries typically occurring after the nominees have been settled upon .
2007_05_15_1847559	1	But the 2008 campaign may be different , with both states planning to hold their primaries on Feb. 5 , when a slew of others , including California and Texas , are also holding theirs .
2007_05_15_1847559	2	That may be part of the reason both Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama were visiting the region yesterday to spotlight endorsements , with Mrs. Clinton getting the backing of Gov. Eliot Spitzer of New York and Mr. Obama gaining the endorsements of Mayor Cory A. Booker of Newark and Mayor Jerramiah Healy of Jersey City .
2007_05_15_1847559	3	For the Democrats , New York has not been a major primary state since 1988 , when the Rev. Jesse Jackson came in behind Michael S. Dukakis , who eventually won the nomination .
2007_05_15_1847559	4	This time around , Mrs. Clinton is hoping to have the home-field advantage , and she drew many of the state 's top elected officials to her endorsement in Albany , including Mr. Spitzer , Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo , Senator Charles E. Schumer , Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and Comptroller Thomas P. DiNapoli .
2007_05_15_1847559	5	Some prominent black officials were also present , including the State Senate minority leader , Malcolm Smith , whom Bill Clinton personally wooed by taking him on a private plane ride earlier this year to Selma , Ala. .
2007_05_15_1847559	6	Mr. Spitzer said Mrs. Clinton was the '' one person who can bring us back , one person who has the vision , the courage , the guts , to say what has to be said , to stand up to those interests who do not like to be stood up to . ''
2007_05_15_1847559	7	One black legislator who did not attend the endorsement was State Senator Bill Perkins of Manhattan , an Obama supporter . ''
2007_05_15_1847559	8	I thought it was important to support the person I thought was best for the country , not simply the person from my state , '' Mr. Perkins said .
2007_05_15_1847559	9	In Trenton yesterday afternoon , Mr. Obama took part in a town meeting with union members sponsored by the A.F.L.-C.I.O. , which is organizing forums across the country for Democratic presidential candidates .
2007_05_15_1847559	10	The candidates have their choice of cities , union officials said , and Mr. Obama selected Trenton because of its working-class community .
2007_05_15_1847559	11	( Senator Clinton selected Detroit for her forum , which is set for June 9 . )
2007_05_15_1847559	12	For more than an hour , Mr. Obama took questions from blue-collar workers on a variety of topics , including health care , trade and education .
2007_05_15_1847559	13	He received booming applause and a sustained standing ovation when he reminded the audience that he did not support the Iraq war . ''
2007_05_15_1847559	14	It is time to bring our troops home right now , '' Mr. Obama said , his voice barely audible over the roaring crowd of about 700 union members .
2007_05_15_1847559	15	Mr. Obama also had two fund-raisers planned for his trip to New Jersey .
2007_05_15_1847559	16	The choice between Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton is weighing heavy on the minds of several voters interviewed in Trenton , including Joann Sims , 50 , who works as a nurse 's aid in Newark . ''
2007_05_15_1847559	17	Do we choose the first woman or the first black man ? ''
2007_05_15_1847559	18	Ms. Sims said . ''
2007_05_15_1847559	19	It 's going to be really close , but today I 'm definitely going to vote for him . ''
2007_05_15_1847560	0	The furniture has yet to arrive for one of the offices that Kirsten Gillibrand , a freshman Democrat in Congress , recently opened here .
2007_05_15_1847560	1	But the list of Republicans angling to challenge her next year is already growing .
2007_05_15_1847560	2	Alexander F. Treadwell , a former state Republican Party chairman , opened a headquarters near Ms. Gillibrand 's main office in Saratoga Springs and has assembled a campaign staff , including a former political director for the House Republicans ' re-election committee .
2007_05_15_1847560	3	Richard Wager , an aide to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York City , formed a campaign committee and is raising money from his old network of allies , including well-heeled donors on Wall Street .
2007_05_15_1847560	4	And several other potential rivals -- including a retired United States Army lieutenant colonel , a former candidate for governor and even the man Ms. Gillibrand defeated last year -- are considering a run .
2007_05_15_1847560	5	It may seem unusually early for the opposition to begin mobilizing against Ms. Gillibrand , who only recently wrote and introduced her first bill since arriving in Washington four months ago .
2007_05_15_1847560	6	But the maneuvering reflects a growing confidence among Republicans that they can win back the district , where the vast majority of voters are registered to their party .
2007_05_15_1847560	7	Indeed , Republican officials in Washington are so confident of Ms. Gillibrand 's vulnerabilities that they say they intend to field test an array of themes in the district that they believe can be applied to other freshman Democrats around the country .
2007_05_15_1847560	8	Chief among those themes : Ms. Gillibrand 's willingness to collect special-interest money despite having deplored the influence of special interests in Washington as a candidate last year , and her propensity for voting with what they call the party 's left-leaning leadership after having campaigned as a centrist . ''
2007_05_15_1847560	9	There are a lot of these recently elected Democrats who claimed to be reformers of the system on the campaign trail but have turned out to be something quite different , '' said Ken Spain , a spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee .
2007_05_15_1847560	10	All this has placed enormous pressure on Ms. Gillibrand , 40 , to raise a great deal of money just months after she won her seat in November .
2007_05_15_1847560	11	Though her advisers say raising money does not detract from legislating , there is little question it has lengthened her workweek .
2007_05_15_1847560	12	Those demands were evident one recent weekend , when she arrived late to a family barbecue after having attended both a fund-raiser in Cooperstown and a town-hall-style meeting in Milford where officials and residents aired their concerns about issues like the local economy and schools .
2007_05_15_1847560	13	The event in Cooperstown was the eighth fund-raising reception this year held by Ms. Gillibrand , one of the largest fund-raisers in the House in the first four months of this year , having taken in nearly $ 700,000 . ''
2007_05_15_1847560	14	It 's the reality of modern-day politics , '' she said , with a hint of resignation in her voice .
2007_05_15_1847560	15	Ms. Gillibrand has agreed to allow The New York Times to chronicle her first year in office representing New York 's 20th Congressional District , which runs from the mid-Hudson Valley to Lake Placid .
2007_05_15_1847560	16	For her and other freshman lawmakers , it is a time of intense learning and sudden challenges , harried travel and nonstop work .
2007_05_15_1847560	17	But it is also a period of political peril : Gary Jacobson , a professor of political science at the University of California , San Diego , has found that while veteran incumbents enjoy a re-election rate of 98 percent , the rate drops to less than 92 percent for first-term incumbents .
2007_05_15_1847560	18	Not surprisingly then , 30 of the 41 Democratic freshmen in the House are facing Republicans who have either announced their candidacies or are said to have plans to announce them , according to the National Republican Congressional Committee .
2007_05_15_1847560	19	Political analysts in both parties predict that the race will cost much more than the roughly $ 6 million that Ms. Gillibrand and her Republican predecessor , John E. Sweeney , spent on their campaigns last year .
2007_05_15_1847560	20	John Nolan , who is known as Jasper and has been chairman of the Saratoga County Republican Committee for the past 20 years , says that he has been telling prospective candidates that they will need at least $ 1 million by the beginning of next year if they hope to compete effectively . ''
2007_05_15_1847560	21	It 's never too early to start running when you are going up against an incumbent , '' he said . ''
2007_05_15_1847560	22	You ca n't wait until 2008 . ''
2007_05_15_1847560	23	But even Republicans are aware that there are risks in gearing up this early in a district where there is ample evidence that the bitterly contested race between Ms. Gillibrand and Mr. Sweeney left voters weary .
2007_05_15_1847560	24	A reminder of those perils came a few weeks ago when the editor of The Glens Falls Post-Star described the Republicans moving to challenge her as '' piranhas '' and pointedly asked in a column , '' Should n't someone be allowed to do their job for at least a year before they have to worry about keeping it ? ''
2007_05_15_1847560	25	Still , Republicans have not been shy about attacking Ms. Gillibrand , for example , by trying to use one of her own open-government ideas against her .
2007_05_15_1847560	26	Shortly after taking office , Ms. Gillibrand directed her staff to publish the details of her meetings , no matter how sensitive , on her Congressional Web site , calling the listing the Sunlight Report .
2007_05_15_1847560	27	But Republicans see these reports as a potential trove of damaging information .
2007_05_15_1847560	28	Examining them , they discovered , for instance , that Ms. Gillibrand , while vacationing with her family in Europe recently , held several fund-raisers for her re-election campaign , including two in London and one in Paris .
2007_05_15_1847560	29	Michael Brady , a former National Republican Congressional Committee operative , disseminated the information on a new Internet news service , the Majority Accountability Project , that he started , noting that it is illegal for foreign citizens to contribute to American campaigns .
2007_05_15_1847560	30	( The Gillibrand camp insisted that attendees were required to show American passports before being permitted into the events and that no money was donated by foreign citizens . )
2007_05_15_1847560	31	In an interview , Mr. Brady accused Ms. Gillibrand of hypocrisy , saying that she had denounced Mr. Sweeney during the campaign for holding a weekend fund-raiser with pharmaceutical lobbyists at a ski resort in Park City , Utah . ''
2007_05_15_1847560	32	This is a woman who criticized her opponent for going to Utah , and here she is going to fund-raisers in foreign countries , '' Mr. Brady said .
2007_05_15_1847560	33	But to Gillibrand supporters who have been concerned that Republicans may use her Sunlight Report against her , the episode shows that '' no good deed goes unpunished , '' as one of her advisers put it .
2007_05_15_1847560	34	Republicans are also depicting Ms. Gillibrand as a liberal who is cloaking her true ideological leanings behind the politically moderate language she employs in her public appearances in the district , as well as in her mailings .
2007_05_15_1847560	35	Mr. Nolan , the Republican leader in Saratoga , is seeking to tie Ms. Gillibrand to the House speaker , Nancy Pelosi -- a strategy that is also being employed by Republican operatives in Washington who are compiling a political dossier on Ms. Gillibrand . ''
2007_05_15_1847560	36	She 's kind of attached to the hip of Pelosi , who is one of the most left-wing speakers in American history , '' Mr. Nolan said .
2007_05_15_1847560	37	Ms. Gillibrand scoffed at such criticism , which she said began within weeks of her taking office .
2007_05_15_1847560	38	She pointed to what she considered her accomplishments so far : voting to cut interest rates on federally backed college loans ; supporting security initiatives recommended by the 9/11 Commission ; providing $ 1 million in grants for sewage , water and road projects in her district . ''
2007_05_15_1847560	39	It 's political , '' she concluded about the attacks . ''
2007_05_15_1847560	40	It 's not about my performance or the good job I am doing . ''
2007_05_15_1847560	41	How far the Republican candidates themselves are willing to go in directly attacking Ms. Gillibrand is an open question .
2007_05_15_1847560	42	Many are clearly mindful of the fact that voters were turned off by the ugly tone of the race between Ms. Gillibrand and Mr. Sweeney .
2007_05_15_1847560	43	( In the final days of that contest , for example , Mr. Sweeney accused the Gillibrand campaign of being behind published reports that his wife placed a call to 911 to report that he had physically abused her .
2007_05_15_1847560	44	No charges resulted from the episode , which he called campaign propaganda .
2007_05_15_1847560	45	Her campaign denied Mr. Sweeney 's contention . ) ''
2007_05_15_1847560	46	The voters of the 20th District have gone through a negative campaign in the past , and anyone who goes that way again will turn them off , '' said Mr. Wager , the Bloomberg aide , who has been traveling the district meeting with party leaders and rank-and-file Republicans .
2007_05_15_1847560	47	Mr. Treadwell , the former state Republican Party chairman , agreed . ''
2007_05_15_1847560	48	I think people are tired of it , '' he said .
2007_05_15_1847560	49	Mr. Treadwell , who recently met with Republican leaders in Washington and sent letters to all 1,400 Republican committeemen in the 20th District , said he is focused on building support for his candidacy among Republicans -- not attacking someone who has barely been in office . ''
2007_05_15_1847560	50	She 's just starting , '' he said of Ms. Gillibrand . ''
2007_05_15_1847560	51	We 'll have to see how her record develops . ''
2007_05_15_1847560	52	Through it all , Ms. Gillibrand has worked like a candidate who is in a tight race .
2007_05_15_1847560	53	She visits even the most politically unwelcoming regions of her district , trying to deliver constituent services and to make the case that she is staying above the political fray .
2007_05_15_1847560	54	That was the case recently when she came here to Otsego County , a heavily Republican area that represented a tiny percentage of the overall vote in the previous election .
2007_05_15_1847560	55	As is her practice , she took along an aide to handle constituent needs , like helping to obtain Social Security benefits .
2007_05_15_1847560	56	Tom Gale , the Republican town supervisor of Milford , said he was pleasantly surprised to see Ms. Gillibrand . ''
2007_05_15_1847560	57	It 's good to see that kind of representation , '' he said . ''
2007_05_15_1847560	58	She actually took the time to come here even though the population here is n't all that large . ''
2007_05_15_1847560	59	The Freshman This is the third article in a series that is chronicling Kirsten Gillibrand 's first year in Congress .
2007_05_15_1847561	0	In the not too distant past here in Turkey 's religious heartland , women would not appear in public unless they were modestly dressed , a single woman was not able to rent an apartment on her own , and the mayor proposed segregating city buses by sex .
2007_05_15_1847561	1	Fears of such restrictions , inflamed by secularist politicians , have led thousands of Turks to march in major cities in the past month .
2007_05_15_1847561	2	A political party with a past in Islamic politics led by Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has tried to capture the country 's highest secular post .
2007_05_15_1847561	3	Once it succeeds , the secularists ' argument goes , Turkey will be dragged back to an earlier era when Islam ran the state .
2007_05_15_1847561	4	[ Another march drew a million people in Izmir on Sunday . ]
2007_05_15_1847561	5	But here in Konya , a leafy city on the plains of central Turkey , Mr. Erdogan 's party has done no such thing .
2007_05_15_1847561	6	In the paradox of modern Turkey , the party here has had a moderating influence , helping to open a guarded society and make it more flexible .
2007_05_15_1847561	7	Konya is still deeply attached to its faith .
2007_05_15_1847561	8	Mosques are spread thickly throughout the city ; there are as many as in Istanbul , which has five times the population .
2007_05_15_1847561	9	But in a part of the world where religion and politics have been a poisonous mix and cultural norms are conservative regardless of religion , it is an oasis : women here wear relatively revealing clothing , couples hold hands and bus segregation is a distant memory . ''
2007_05_15_1847561	10	We 've been wearing the same dress for 80 years , and it does n't fit anymore , '' said Yoruk Kurtaran , who travels extensively in Turkey . ''
2007_05_15_1847561	11	Things used to be black and white . ''
2007_05_15_1847561	12	Now , he said , '' there are a lot of grays . ''
2007_05_15_1847561	13	The shift shows the evolution of Turkey 's Islamic movement , which has matured under Mr. Erdogan , abandoning the restrictive practices of its predecessors and demonstrating to its observant constituents the benefits of belonging to the European Union .
2007_05_15_1847561	14	It also follows a pattern occurring throughout Turkey , where the secularists who founded the state out of the Ottoman Empire 's remains are now lagging behind religious Turks in efforts to modernize it.But secular Turks , like those who took part in the recent protests , do not believe that Mr. Erdogan and his allies have changed .
2007_05_15_1847561	15	The mayor who proposed segregation , for example , is now part of Mr. Erdogan 's party .
2007_05_15_1847561	16	The protesters argue that the party may say it wants more religious freedom for its constituents , for example allowing observant women to wear their head scarves in universities , but it has never laid out its vision for how to protect secular lifestyles .
2007_05_15_1847561	17	Mr. Erdogan 's party has been the most flexible and open of all parties that consider Islam an important part of Turkish society .
2007_05_15_1847561	18	Its politics have so far been respectful of secular freedom in most cases .
2007_05_15_1847561	19	But there are harder-line members who would like to see a more religious society , and secular Turks fear that highly personal questions like their children 's education and rights for unmarried women could be threatened .
2007_05_15_1847561	20	In the country as a whole , religious Turks have felt like second-class citizens for generations , in part a legacy of Ataturk 's radical , secular revolution in the early 20th century .
2007_05_15_1847561	21	Now , elevated by a decade of economic growth , they are pressing for a bigger share of power .
2007_05_15_1847561	22	In Konya some of the change started from the top .
2007_05_15_1847561	23	In 2003 , around the time Mr. Erdogan 's party came to power , an irreverent ophthalmologist and a veterinarian with long hair were appointed to run Selcuk University in Konya .
2007_05_15_1847561	24	They immediately began challenging the sensibilities of this conservative city , organizing concerts and encouraging student clubs .
2007_05_15_1847561	25	Kursat Turgut , the veterinarian , who became vice rector , said he had been confronted by a group of students who went to his office and demanded that he cancel a concert because they did not like the singer .
2007_05_15_1847561	26	Change is the most difficult thing , '' Mr. Turgut said , sitting in the rector 's office , where paintings lined the walls . ''
2007_05_15_1847561	27	It takes time to change a mentality . ''
2007_05_15_1847561	28	The students were from a nationalist group with an Islamic tinge that for years had used scare tactics to enforce a strict moral code on campus .
2007_05_15_1847561	29	When Umit , who did not want to give his last name , started at the university 's veterinary school five years ago he was chastised by students from the group for cuddling with his girlfriend and , on another occasion , for wearing shorts . ''
2007_05_15_1847561	30	They thought they were protecting honor and morals , '' said Aliye Cetinkaya , a journalist who moved here 12 years ago for college . ''
2007_05_15_1847561	31	If we crossed the line there was a fight . ''
2007_05_15_1847561	32	Mr. Turgut and the rector , Suleyman Okudan , shut down the group 's activities .
2007_05_15_1847561	33	Now , four years later , there are more than 80 student clubs , students like Umit behave and dress any way they choose , and Mr. Turgut 's concerts , open to the public , draw large crowds . ''
2007_05_15_1847561	34	It is like a different century , '' Ms. Cetinkaya said .
2007_05_15_1847561	35	She still faces limitations .
2007_05_15_1847561	36	When she covered a demonstration in Konya early last year against the Muhammad cartoons published in Denmark , stones and shoes were thrown at her because she was not wearing a scarf .
2007_05_15_1847561	37	But such incidents are rare , and far outweighed by improvements .
2007_05_15_1847561	38	For example , there were only about 50 women in the two-year degree program she attended a decade ago .
2007_05_15_1847561	39	Now the number is above 1,000 , she said .
2007_05_15_1847561	40	The deep-rooted religiosity in Konya found public expression in politics in the late 1980s , when the city became one of the first in the country to elect a pro-Islamic party -- the Welfare Party of Necmettin Erbakan , the grandfather of the Turkish Islamic movement -- to run the city .
2007_05_15_1847561	41	Mr. Erbakan himself was elected to Parliament from Konya .
2007_05_15_1847561	42	The administration was restrictive : it was a Welfare Party mayor , Halil Urun , who proposed , unsuccessfully , segregating the buses in 1989 .
2007_05_15_1847561	43	But the city kept electing the party until the late 1990s , when it was shut down by the state establishment for straying from secularism .
2007_05_15_1847561	44	Then , in 2000 , a young member of the banned party , Recep Tayyip Erdogan , began the Justice and Development Party .
2007_05_15_1847561	45	Mr. Erdogan had made a concerted effort to take Islam out of politics altogether -- aware that continuing to push religion would lead to the same end -- and it was unclear whether Konya voters would accept it .
2007_05_15_1847561	46	Of the 32 members of the City Council , all but two are now members of Mr. Erdogan 's party .
2007_05_15_1847561	47	It was economics that convinced Ahmet Agirbasli , 57 , a businessman who sells car parts and pasta .
2007_05_15_1847561	48	When he was younger he did not shake hands with women .
2007_05_15_1847561	49	For years he voted for Mr. Erbakan 's party .
2007_05_15_1847561	50	He did not believe that Turkey 's future was with Europe , but he changed his mind after Mr. Erdogan 's party began reforms with the intention of joining the European Union , and his business began to grow . ''
2007_05_15_1847561	51	Erbakan did n't have an open mind , '' Mr. Agirbasli said , eating a club sandwich in a hotel restaurant . ''
2007_05_15_1847561	52	He did n't believe the country needed links with the rest of the world . ''
2007_05_15_1847561	53	Now he sells macaroni to 50 countries .
2007_05_15_1847561	54	Five years ago he sold to only 10 .
2007_05_15_1847561	55	Akif Emre , a columnist at Yeni Safak , a conservative newspaper in Istanbul , argues that Mr. Erdogan has helped to bridge the gap between Turkey 's religious heartland and urban , secular Turks . ''
2007_05_15_1847561	56	They really accept secularism , '' he said of Mr. Erdogan and his allies . ''
2007_05_15_1847561	57	They are changing the mentality .
2007_05_15_1847561	58	Conservative people changed their lifestyle toward a more secular way . ''
2007_05_15_1847561	59	Religious Turks , for their part , still harbor an unspoken wariness of the state .
2007_05_15_1847561	60	New civil organizations are more focused on building mosques than engaging in public debate , and people scrupulously avoid talking about politics .
2007_05_15_1847561	61	Religious extremists have been found on the fringes .
2007_05_15_1847561	62	In January the authorities arrested a man they said was the leader of Al Qaeda in Turkey , and in 2000 a pile of bodies that showed signs of torture was found buried under a villa rented by a homegrown Islamist group called Hezbollah . ''
2007_05_15_1847561	63	Konya is one of the main hubs of traditional and conservative , anti-Ankara countryside , '' said Ersin Kalaycioglu , a professor of political science at Isik University in Istanbul . ''
2007_05_15_1847561	64	It has a structure that takes religion very seriously and formulates social life around it . ''
2007_05_15_1847561	65	Rahmi Bastoklu , the leader in Konya of the secularist Republican People 's Party and the only one of the Konya district 's 16 members of Parliament who is not from Mr. Erdogan 's party , put it bluntly : '' People have to leave Konya to enjoy themselves . ''
2007_05_15_1847561	66	But an unspoken understanding between Konya 's religious Turks and the secular state is in place , in which the mosques are left alone , but religious Turks do not press too many demands on the state .
2007_05_15_1847561	67	The balance is often held steady by Mr. Erdogan 's party .
2007_05_15_1847561	68	Still , pushing too hard against the secular establishment might mean the loss of recent gains . ''
2007_05_15_1847561	69	It 's not a useful thing to talk about , '' said Ilhan Cumrali , 36 , sitting in his clothing store among racks of floor-length skirts . ''
2007_05_15_1847561	70	We are trying to find the right path .
2007_05_15_1847561	71	If we do it too aggressively there will be a negative reaction . ''
2007_05_15_1847562	0	Kate Webb , a brave , no-nonsense correspondent during the Vietnam War who was erroneously reported to have been captured , killed and cremated in Cambodia -- only to emerge from the jungle alive -- died on Sunday in Sydney , Australia .
2007_05_15_1847562	1	The cause was bowel cancer , her brother , Jeremy Webb , told The Associated Press .
2007_05_15_1847562	2	Ms. Webb lived on the Hunter River , north of Sydney .
2007_05_15_1847562	3	On April 7 , 1971 , when she was Phnom Penh bureau chief for United Press International and one of a handful of women reporting on the war , North Vietnamese troops in Cambodia captured her and five other journalists and held them for 23 harrowing days .
2007_05_15_1847562	4	She and the other five , a Japanese and four Cambodians , endured thirst , infection , long interrogations and other traumas , but she wrote that she had been courteously treated .
2007_05_15_1847562	5	The Japanese man helped allay stress by teaching her the Japanese tea ceremony .
2007_05_15_1847562	6	On May 1 , she was released , along with the others , and returned home with two types of malaria .
2007_05_15_1847562	7	A full explanation of why she was freed never appeared ; other groups of journalists captured around the same time were sometimes killed or held indefinitely .
2007_05_15_1847562	8	By then , The New York Times and other newspapers had published obituaries , presuming she was a woman whose cremated body had been found , and her family had held a memorial service for her .
2007_05_15_1847562	9	The Times remembered her both as a soft-voiced young '' waif '' in a striped dress and sandals on the streets of Saigon , and as a cool , incisive reporter when she put on combat boots , helmet and flak jacket to go on missions with troops .
2007_05_15_1847562	10	The Times account cited her bravery in mortar and rocket attacks , in landings in disabled helicopters and in the face of the normal battlefield dangers of bullets and shrapnel .
2007_05_15_1847562	11	It told how she rushed back to help the wounded after an explosion knocked her flat , then wrote a moving account of the episode .
2007_05_15_1847562	12	Agence France-Presse quoted Peter Arnett , who won a Pulitzer Prize for his Vietnam reporting , as saying : '' Kate Webb was one of the earliest -- and best -- women correspondents of the Vietnam War .
2007_05_15_1847562	13	She was fearless as an action reporter , with a talent for the vivid phrase . ''
2007_05_15_1847562	14	Ms. Webb had paid her own way to Vietnam , arriving in 1967 with only a couple of hundred dollars and an old Remington typewriter .
2007_05_15_1847562	15	She was at first a freelancer for U.P.I. and worked her way up to be chief of the news agency 's operation in Cambodia , the post she held when she was captured .
2007_05_15_1847562	16	Ms. Webb went on to cover many other major upheavals , mainly in Asia .
2007_05_15_1847562	17	After the fall of Saigon in 1975 , she reported on the rise of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia , the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi in India and the strife in East Timor .
2007_05_15_1847562	18	She was also on hand for the ouster of Ferdinand Marcos in the Philippines , the Persian Gulf war , the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan and the turnover of Hong Kong to China .
2007_05_15_1847562	19	In Afghanistan , a militiaman almost scalped her when he dragged her up the stairs by her long hair , tearing out a large clump .
2007_05_15_1847562	20	In India , she nearly lost an arm after a motorcycle accident .
2007_05_15_1847562	21	For all her hard-drinking , chain-smoking , after-hours bravado among journalistic compatriots , her actions often revealed selflessness , even tenderness .
2007_05_15_1847562	22	She gave shelter to a family of Afghan refugees in her own house , then paid for the children to go to college .
2007_05_15_1847562	23	Ms. Webb left U.P.I. in 1985 to work for Agence France-Presse , where she stayed until her retirement in 2001 .
2007_05_15_1847562	24	She said she had become '' too old to keep up with front-line reporting , and that was the only kind I liked . ''
2007_05_15_1847562	25	Ms. Webb was born in 1943 in Christchurch , New Zealand , and given the first name Catherine , which she detested .
2007_05_15_1847562	26	When she was 8 , her family moved to Australia , where her father had been appointed a political science professor .
2007_05_15_1847562	27	At 15 , she was charged with first-degree murder after a schoolmate committed suicide with a rifle Ms. Webb had handed her .
2007_05_15_1847562	28	Ms. Webb said she had thought it was a joke , and the charges were dismissed .
2007_05_15_1847562	29	Then , both her parents died in a car crash when she was 18 .
2007_05_15_1847562	30	She said in an interview with The Times in 1972 that she had been told she woke up in the night screaming . ''
2007_05_15_1847562	31	But I do n't know which part of my life I 'm screaming about , '' she said .
2007_05_15_1847562	32	In 1963 , she graduated from Melbourne University with honors in symbolic logic , then worked as an artist , making stained glass windows and painting .
2007_05_15_1847562	33	Agence France-Presse reported that she stumbled into journalism when she was forced to pay for a stained glass window she shattered while working on it .
2007_05_15_1847562	34	She got a job as a secretary at The Sydney Daily Mirror , then became a reporter .
2007_05_15_1847562	35	The paper sent her to Indonesia to report on the crisis that followed the fall of Sukarno in 1967 .
2007_05_15_1847562	36	Later in 1967 , she went to Saigon on her own and became a part-time correspondent for U.P.I. , which hired her as a full-time staff member within six months .
2007_05_15_1847562	37	The Times reported that she was so dedicated that U.P.I. had trouble getting her to take periodic '' rest and rehabilitation '' tours outside Vietnam .
2007_05_15_1847562	38	On one supposed vacation , she spent 10 days living with the First Infantry Division of the South Vietnamese Army to see how it performed in action .
2007_05_15_1847562	39	She also spent considerable nonworking time investigating the involvement of South Vietnamese officials in the black market , a subject that had not been fully explored .
2007_05_15_1847562	40	Once , after writing late at her office , she came home to find a .45 - caliber bullet hole in her apartment door and the slug embedded in the wall just above her bed .
2007_05_15_1847562	41	In 1969 , Ms. Webb , who was briefly engaged to an American soldier , left Saigon and worked for a short time in U.P.I. 's Pittsburgh office .
2007_05_15_1847562	42	In 1970 , she went to Phnom Penh , then became bureau chief after her boss was killed .
2007_05_15_1847562	43	In addition to her brother , Ms. Webb is survived by her sister , Rachel Miller .
2007_05_15_1847562	44	They are the same survivors listed in her first obituaries .
2007_05_15_1847562	45	Ms. Webb said in 2002 that most people thought she was tough , but that she was '' a real softie . ''

2007_05_15_1847565	0	To the Editor : Re '' Genes Take Charge , and Diets Fall by the Wayside '' ( May 8 ) : No one disputes that genetics plays a role in obesity , but the worldwide rise that has occurred over the past 50 years is n't due just to genes .
2007_05_15_1847565	1	Genes have n't changed in the past 50 years ; the environment has .
2007_05_15_1847565	2	There are food and labor-saving devices everywhere .
2007_05_15_1847565	3	The good news is that there are people who lose weight and keep it off .
2007_05_15_1847565	4	The mean weight loss among more than 5,000 men and women in the National Weight Control Registry is 60 pounds , and the group has maintained that loss for roughly five years .
2007_05_15_1847565	5	They work hard at it , and no one claims it 's easy , but they do it .

2007_05_15_1847566	0	To the Editor : Re '' The Struggle to Move Beyond ` Why Me ? ' ''
2007_05_15_1847566	1	( May 8 ) : After my diagnosis of breast cancer two years ago , I kept coming back to Shirley Jackson 's short story '' The Lottery . ''
2007_05_15_1847566	2	I identified with Tessie in the story , who acts almost haughty in her denial that she would be picked in the lottery , and who goes down kicking and screaming '' it 's unfair '' until the end .
2007_05_15_1847566	3	I thought I could prevent serious illnesses by eating well , exercising and keeping my medical appointments .
2007_05_15_1847566	4	I , too , was determined to find out '' why '' after my diagnosis , but found no culprit .
2007_05_15_1847566	5	Breast cancer was my life 's kick in the pants that I could control nothing .
2007_05_15_1847566	6	While I do not push myself as hard and do take time to enjoy more , the trauma is still with me .
2007_05_15_1847567	0	The Giants have two place-kickers on their roster .
2007_05_15_1847567	1	One , Josh Huston , spent most of last fall with the odd job of cleaning junk out of foreclosed houses .
2007_05_15_1847567	2	He had his appendix removed last week and will probably not kick again until June .
2007_05_15_1847567	3	The other , Marc Hickok , has had one professional kicking job since he left college four years ago .
2007_05_15_1847567	4	That came in arenafootball2 , the Arena Football League 's minor league .
2007_05_15_1847567	5	Whether the Giants sign someone who has attempted an N.F.L. kick will depend largely on the performance of Huston and Hickok in the coming weeks and through training camp , which starts in late July .
2007_05_15_1847567	6	But kicker may be the most intriguing position battle to be waged between now and the beginning of the season for the Giants , who are looking to replace Jay Feely , who signed with the Miami Dolphins as a free agent .
2007_05_15_1847567	7	For now , the job rests on the foot of Huston , who was left to do little but watch the team 's three-day rookie minicamp , which ended Monday .
2007_05_15_1847567	8	The Giants have been tracking his progress the past two months .
2007_05_15_1847567	9	He made 87 percent of his field-goal attempts -- most from 40 to 49 yards -- in simulated drills at Giants Stadium in April and early May .
2007_05_15_1847567	10	On May 7 , after kicking and working out , Huston left to play golf . ''
2007_05_15_1847567	11	I shot 78 , '' he said . ''
2007_05_15_1847567	12	I was strokin ' it , but I felt a little weird the whole time . ''
2007_05_15_1847567	13	The stomach pain arrived after dinner , and Huston felt only marginally better the next day .
2007_05_15_1847567	14	By Tuesday night , his appendix had been removed .
2007_05_15_1847567	15	With three puncture wounds from the surgery in his belly , Huston is exercising again , but unlikely to try to kick a football for a few weeks .
2007_05_15_1847567	16	Huston had spent the past couple of months tuning his abilities with an eye toward this minicamp , knowing General Manager Jerry Reese and his personnel staff would be watching closely . ''
2007_05_15_1847567	17	Are you kidding me ? ''
2007_05_15_1847567	18	he said when asked about the anticipation and subsequent disappointment . ''
2007_05_15_1847567	19	You practice with your coach , they see the film , and they look at the numbers .
2007_05_15_1847567	20	But to be able to go out there in front of Jerry Reese and Kevin Abrams and Dave Gettleman and those guys -- they 're out there watching , and that 's what I 'm practicing for .
2007_05_15_1847567	21	It 's a bummer . ''
2007_05_15_1847567	22	Huston , 25 , spent most of his college career at Ohio State stuck on the roster behind Mike Nugent , now the Jets ' kicker .
2007_05_15_1847567	23	He performed well when he finally got the top job as a senior in 2005 , and spent last year 's training camp with the Bears , who cut him in favor of Robbie Gould .
2007_05_15_1847567	24	Between jobs in Columbus , Ohio , as a cashier at a market and cleaning out stuff left behind in foreclosed houses , Huston tried out for three N.F.L. teams last season , including the Giants in December , when Feely had a sore foot .
2007_05_15_1847567	25	At season 's end , the Giants signed him , unsure if they would keep Feely .
2007_05_15_1847567	26	The job was Huston 's when Feely left for the Dolphins in early March .
2007_05_15_1847567	27	But Huston knew that the team would bring in at least one other kicker to stimulate competition .
2007_05_15_1847567	28	In April , the Giants auditioned four kickers : the former Colts Pro Bowler Mike Vanderjagt , who was cut by the Dallas Cowboys last year ; the six-year N.F.L. veteran Paul Edinger ; Carter Warley of the Arena Football League 's New York Dragons ; and Hickok , a lifelong Giants fan .
2007_05_15_1847567	29	Hickok won the job after he made 11 of 14 kicks , including a 55-yarder , in chilly , windy conditions .
2007_05_15_1847567	30	Hickok , 26 , spent three years after graduating from Connecticut unsuccessfully chasing a kicking job .
2007_05_15_1847567	31	He moved to Florida to focus on kicking , and worked as a bartender , then a personal trainer .
2007_05_15_1847567	32	He struggled to get invitations to even the lowest-level tryouts , but finally captured the arena football job in Stockton , Calif. , last year .
2007_05_15_1847567	33	That helped secure an invitation to an N.F.L. Europa combine this spring , where the Giants spotted him . ''
2007_05_15_1847567	34	There 's no negative out of any of this , '' Hickok said . ''
2007_05_15_1847567	35	When I 've been busting my butt telling people where I 'm trying to get to , people look at me like I 'm crazy . ''
2007_05_15_1847567	36	The Giants seem comfortable letting the kicks fall where they may .
2007_05_15_1847567	37	Kicker is football 's most interchangeable position , and the Giants have waited until the last moment to make a final decision before .
2007_05_15_1847567	38	In 2004 , Tom Coughlin 's first season as head coach , the Giants planned to use the untested Todd France as their kicker .
2007_05_15_1847567	39	Five days before the season opener , they signed the 14-year veteran Steve Christie . ''
2007_05_15_1847567	40	They could sign a veteran at any time , '' said Huston , who offers up equal doses of smiles and swagger . ''
2007_05_15_1847567	41	But even if they do sign a veteran , it does n't mean it 's their job . ''
2007_05_15_1847568	0	It 's been a long time since anyone viewed the National Football League as marginal in any way .
2007_05_15_1847568	1	Market muscle and viewership explain why the N.F.L. gets more television money than any other league and why the NFL Network was conceived as having nearly limitless appeal .
2007_05_15_1847568	2	Then came Bernard J. Fried , a Time Warner customer who , like me , can not get the NFL Network .
2007_05_15_1847568	3	Fried is a New York State Supreme Court justice who , in a decision that he wrote May 4 but did not release until last Thursday , ruled that Comcast could move the NFL Network from a broad digital cable service to a much-less-viewed digital sports tier .
2007_05_15_1847568	4	Fried agreed that Comcast had the contractual right to shift the NFL Network to its sports tier if it could not make a deal for ( a ) the cultish Sunday Ticket package of out-of-market games , which remained exclusive to DirecTV , or ( b ) a new eight-game , late-season package of N.F.L. games for Versus .
2007_05_15_1847568	5	The N.F.L. rejected Comcast 's offer of about $ 400 million a year for the eight games last year , then added them to the NFL Network with a monthly surcharge of 55 cents a subscriber .
2007_05_15_1847568	6	Versus , which is owned by Comcast , no doubt would have upped its fee from its current 13 cents a subscriber , according to Kagan Research , if it had gotten those games .
2007_05_15_1847568	7	The league has filed a notice of appeal of Fried 's decision to the state Appellate Division , and Comcast is telling its affiliates to get ready to move the channel to a sports tier . ''
2007_05_15_1847568	8	We 're not going quietly and will continue to fight for what 's right , '' said Seth Palansky , a spokesman for the NFL Network .
2007_05_15_1847568	9	( Some level of quiet will continue ; Fried sealed the case early on at the N.F.L. 's request .
2007_05_15_1847568	10	Only a hearing transcript is public record , and the league is unlikely to ask for the file to be unsealed . )
2007_05_15_1847568	11	Fried 's ruling , if it is upheld , would do away with the NFL Network for about 6.5 million Comcast subscribers , while 750,000 would be able to see it on a sports tier for about $ 5 a month .
2007_05_15_1847568	12	The decision will almost certainly lead Time Warner , Cablevision and Charter , the largest cable operators that do not offer the channel , to seek the right to carry it on a sports tier . ''
2007_05_15_1847568	13	I do n't know if the decision is precedential , '' said Fred Dressler , a former Time Warner Cable executive and lead programming negotiator , '' but it will help other cable operators .
2007_05_15_1847568	14	They 'll say , ` If you sold it to Comcast that way , you ought to sell it to everybody else that way . ' ''
2007_05_15_1847568	15	He added that those with existing deals could only capitalize on an anti-NFL Network decision if their contracts allow them to match better terms of carriage given to Comcast . ''
2007_05_15_1847568	16	Right now , I feel the decision is unique to Comcast , '' Dressler said .
2007_05_15_1847568	17	Fried 's ruling is a crowd-pleaser for cable operators who believe that sports networks are too expensive and belong on tiers that require subscribers to pay extra .
2007_05_15_1847568	18	Their mantra is that the broad swath of customers on expanded or digital basic should not have to pay for what only a narrow slice of sports lovers desires .
2007_05_15_1847568	19	But operators have not exiled overpriced sports channels to tiers .
2007_05_15_1847568	20	High-priced regional sports networks like YES , NESN and SNY still abound on expanded basic , as do ESPN and ESPN2 ; but newer channels like Fuel , CSTV , the Tennis Channel and the Fox College Sports channels are sports-tier mainstays .
2007_05_15_1847568	21	NBA TV 's incongruous presence on sports tiers like Time Warner 's stamps it as a niche channel with 12 million subscribers .
2007_05_15_1847568	22	If the NFL Network were consigned to sports tiers , it would make those packages more attractive .
2007_05_15_1847568	23	That would be an empty victory for the NFL Network , which says its presence helps cable and satellite operators add new digital subscribers .
2007_05_15_1847568	24	But the NFL Network game is flawed : all its games are simulcast on local broadcast stations in teams ' markets , meaning home fans are not inconvenienced if a cable operator refuses to carry the channel .
2007_05_15_1847568	25	There are , as yet , no legal challenges to the growth of the nascent MLB Channel .
2007_05_15_1847568	26	It will not start until 2009 , and we know almost nothing about what it will be beyond being '' crucial '' to the survival of the sport , as Bob DuPuy , the president of Major League Baseball , said during Capitol Hill testimony .
2007_05_15_1847568	27	The tortuous talks behind the recent MLB Channel deal -- which featured the use of access to the Extra Innings package of out-of-market games as leverage against cable operators -- led to a subscriber universe of 40 million on digital basic , and none on sports tiers .
2007_05_15_1847568	28	That success would have been impossible had baseball not given a 17 percent stake in the channel to DirecTV and a second 17 percent stake to the InDemand cable consortium ( Comcast , Time Warner and Cox ) , but not to Cablevision .
2007_05_15_1847568	29	The NFL Network has not traded parts of itself to snare more subscribers .
2007_05_15_1847568	30	If it did , it might be in almost every home .

2007_05_15_1847569	0	Liko Kenney , a cousin of the champion ski racer Bode Miller , had at least two confrontations in 2003 with Bruce McKay , the local police officer he killed Friday night in a shooting that left both men dead .
2007_05_15_1847569	1	Records released Monday by the Grafton County attorney 's office showed that Kenney was convicted of assaulting McKay when McKay and three other police officers tried to detain him in January 2003 .
2007_05_15_1847569	2	About three months after that scuffle , McKay responded to a call concerning Kenney 's violation of the conditions of his bail .
2007_05_15_1847569	3	The shootings Friday took place less than a mile from where the Kenney family lives and where Miller grew up .
2007_05_15_1847569	4	Miller declined to comment about the situation Monday .
2007_05_15_1847569	5	He announced Saturday that he would continue to race , but independently of the United States ski team .
2007_05_15_1847569	6	The double shooting has divided this town of 900 , where many residents said that McKay , 48 , and Kenney , 24 , had a running feud .
2007_05_15_1847569	7	The police reports said that during the January 2003 incident , Kenney grabbed and squeezed McKay 's groin , at which point McKay '' applied lawful defensive force by engaging in a protective maneuver to successfully release Kenney 's grip by striking the left side of Kenney 's face . ''
2007_05_15_1847569	8	In April 2003 , one of Kenney 's uncles , Bill Kenney , called the police to report that Liko Kenney was trespassing on the corner of the family 's property , where Bill Kenney works as an organic farmer .
2007_05_15_1847569	9	McKay was one of the officers who responded to that call .
2007_05_15_1847569	10	According to the report , he identified a blowgun and steel darts attached to the all-terrain vehicle Kenney was driving .
2007_05_15_1847569	11	That later proved to violate the conditions of Kenney 's bail .
2007_05_15_1847569	12	Kenney was put under house arrest ; he later wore an electronic monitoring device on his ankle .
2007_05_15_1847569	13	Kenney was also convicted of assaulting a 15-year-old boy on April 24 , 2007 , in a dispute over ownership of a pistol , according to officials and relatives of Kenney .
2007_05_15_1847569	14	Mark Montminy , the Franconia police chief , said that McKay , originally from Bronxville , N.Y. , was an '' outstanding '' officer .
2007_05_15_1847569	15	Montminy said he expected 4,000 to 6,000 law enforcement officials to come to the town Thursday for ceremonies honoring McKay .
2007_05_15_1847569	16	Jane E. Young , a senior assistant attorney general in New Hampshire , said that an investigation into the shootings on Friday was continuing .
2007_05_15_1847570	0	As Oscar Pistorius of South Africa crouched in the starting blocks for the 200 meters on Sunday , the small crowd turned its attention to the sprinter who calls himself the fastest man on no legs .
2007_05_15_1847570	1	Pistorius wants to be the first amputee runner to compete in the Olympics .
2007_05_15_1847570	2	But despite his ascendance , he is facing resistance from track and field 's world governing body , which is seeking to bar him on the grounds that the technology of his prosthetics may give him an unfair advantage over sprinters using their natural legs .
2007_05_15_1847570	3	His first strides were choppy Sunday , a necessary accommodation to sprinting on a pair of j-shaped blades made of carbon fiber and known as Cheetahs .
2007_05_15_1847570	4	Pistorius was born without the fibula in his lower legs and with other defects in his feet .
2007_05_15_1847570	5	He had both legs amputated below the knee when he was 11 months old .
2007_05_15_1847570	6	At 20 , his coach says , he is like a five-speed engine with no second gear .
2007_05_15_1847570	7	Yet Pistorius is also a searing talent who has begun erasing the lines between abled and disabled , raising philosophical questions : What should an athlete look like ?
2007_05_15_1847570	8	Where should limits be placed on technology to balance fair play with the right to compete ?
2007_05_15_1847570	9	Would the nature of sport be altered if athletes using artificial limbs could run faster or jump higher than the best athletes using their natural limbs ?
2007_05_15_1847570	10	Once at full speed Sunday , Pistorius handily won the 100 and 200 meters here at the Paralympic World Cup , an international competition for disabled athletes .
2007_05_15_1847570	11	A cold , rainy afternoon tempered his performances , but his victories came decisively and kept him aimed toward his goal of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing , even though international track officials seek to block his entrance .
2007_05_15_1847570	12	Since March , Pistorius has delivered startling record performances for disabled athletes at 100 meters ( 10.91 seconds ) , 200 meters ( 21.58 seconds ) and 400 meters ( 46.34 seconds ) .
2007_05_15_1847570	13	Those times do not meet Olympic qualifying standards for men , but the Beijing Games are still 15 months away .
2007_05_15_1847570	14	Already , Pistorius is fast enough that his marks would have won gold medals in equivalent women 's races at the 2004 Athens Olympics .
2007_05_15_1847570	15	Pistorius 's time of 46.56 in the 400 earned him a second-place finish in March against able-bodied runners at the South African national championships .
2007_05_15_1847570	16	This seemingly makes him a candidate for the Olympic 4x400-meter relay should South Africa qualify as one of the world 's 16 fastest teams . ''
2007_05_15_1847570	17	I do n't see myself as disabled , '' said the blond , spiky-haired Pistorius , a former rugby and water polo player who declines to park in spaces reserved for the disabled . ''
2007_05_15_1847570	18	There 's nothing I ca n't do that able-bodied athletes can do . ''
2007_05_15_1847570	19	An Equalizer or an Edge Still , the question persists : Do prosthetic legs simply level the playing field for Pistorius , compensating for his disability , or do they give him an inequitable edge via what some call techno-doping ?
2007_05_15_1847570	20	Experts say there have been limited scientific studies on the biomechanics of amputee runners , especially those missing both legs .
2007_05_15_1847570	21	And because Pistorius lost his legs as an infant , his speed on carbon-fiber legs can not be compared with his speed on natural legs .
2007_05_15_1847570	22	Track and field 's world governing body , based in Monaco and known by the initials I.A.A.F. , has recently prohibited the use of technological aids like springs and wheels , disqualifying Pistorius from events that it sanctions .
2007_05_15_1847570	23	A final ruling is expected in August .
2007_05_15_1847570	24	The International Olympic Committee allows governing bodies to make their own eligibility rules , though it can intervene .
2007_05_15_1847570	25	Since 2004 , for example , transgender athletes have been allowed to compete in the Olympics . ''
2007_05_15_1847570	26	With all due respect , we can not accept something that provides advantages , '' said Elio Locatelli of Italy , the director of development for the I.A.A.F. , urging Pistorius to concentrate on the Paralympics that will follow the Olympics in Beijing . ''
2007_05_15_1847570	27	It affects the purity of sport .
2007_05_15_1847570	28	Next will be another device where people can fly with something on their back . ''
2007_05_15_1847570	29	Others have questioned the governing body 's motivation . ''
2007_05_15_1847570	30	I pose a question '' for the I.A.A.F. , said Robert Gailey , an associate professor of physical therapy at the University of Miami Medical School , who has studied amputee runners . ''
2007_05_15_1847570	31	Are they looking at not having an unfair advantage ?
2007_05_15_1847570	32	Or are they discriminating because of the purity of the Olympics , because they do n't want to see a disabled man line up against an able-bodied man for fear that if the person who does n't have the perfect body wins , what does that say about the image of man ? ''
2007_05_15_1847570	33	According to Gailey , a prosthetic leg returns only about 80 percent of the energy absorbed in each stride , while a natural leg returns up to 240 percent , providing much more spring . ''
2007_05_15_1847570	34	There is no science that he has an advantage , only that he is competing at a disadvantage , '' Gailey , who has served as an official in disabled sports , said of Pistorius .
2007_05_15_1847570	35	Foremost among the I.A.A.F. 's concerns is that Pistorius 's prosthetic limbs may make him taller than he would have been on natural legs and may unfairly lengthen his stride , allowing him to lower his best times by several seconds in the past three years , while most elite sprinters improve by hundredths of a second . ''
2007_05_15_1847570	36	The rule book says a foot has to be in contact with the starting block , '' Leon Fleiser , a general manager of the South African Olympic Committee , said . ''
2007_05_15_1847570	37	What is the definition of a foot ?
2007_05_15_1847570	38	Is a prosthetic device a foot , or is it an actual foot ? ''
2007_05_15_1847570	39	I.A.A.F. officials have also expressed concern that Pistorius could topple over , obstructing others or injuring himself and fellow competitors .
2007_05_15_1847570	40	Some also fear that , without limits on technological aids , able-bodied runners could begin wearing carbon-fiber plates or other unsuitably springy devices in their shoes .
2007_05_15_1847570	41	Among ethicists , Pistorius 's success has spurred talk of '' transhumans '' and '' cyborgs . ''
2007_05_15_1847570	42	Some note that athletes already modify themselves in a number of ways , including baseball sluggers who undergo laser eye surgery to enhance their vision and pitchers who have elbow reconstruction using sturdier ligaments from elsewhere in the body .
2007_05_15_1847570	43	At least three disabled athletes have competed in the Summer Olympics : George Eyser , an American , won a gold medal in gymnastics while competing on a wooden leg at the 1904 Games in St. Louis ; Neroli Fairhall , a paraplegic from New Zealand , competed in archery in the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles ; and Marla Runyan , a legally blind runner from the United States , competed in the 1,500 meters at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney .
2007_05_15_1847570	44	But Pistorius would be the first amputee to compete in a track event , international officials said .
2007_05_15_1847570	45	A sobering question was posed recently on the Web site of the Connecticut-based Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies . ''
2007_05_15_1847570	46	Given the arms race nature of competition , '' will technological advantages cause '' athletes to do something as seemingly radical as having their healthy natural limbs replaced by artificial ones ? ''
2007_05_15_1847570	47	wrote George Dvorsky , a member of the institute 's board of directors . ''
2007_05_15_1847570	48	Is it self-mutilation when you 're getting a better limb ? ''
2007_05_15_1847570	49	Limits and Accommodations Historically , the I.A.A.F. has placed limits on devices that assist athletes .
2007_05_15_1847570	50	It prohibits an array of performance-enhancing drugs .
2007_05_15_1847570	51	And it does not allow wheelchair athletes into the Olympic marathon , given that wheels provide a clear advantage in speed .
2007_05_15_1847570	52	But the governing body has also embraced technological advances .
2007_05_15_1847570	53	For instance , it permits athletes to sleep in tent-like devices designed to simulate high altitude and increase oxygen-carrying capacity .
2007_05_15_1847570	54	As disabled athletes improve their performances , the I.A.A.F. is certain to be faced with more decisions about accommodating them .
2007_05_15_1847570	55	Last February , Jeff Skiba , who has one leg amputated below the knee , competed in the high jump at the United States indoor track and field championships .
2007_05_15_1847570	56	Some I.A.A.F. officials say Pistorius 's application should not be treated dismissively .
2007_05_15_1847570	57	Although he would not be considered a medal candidate , his appearance at the Beijing Games could provide an inspiring story . ''
2007_05_15_1847570	58	There is no real grounds to say he should not be allowed to compete '' in the Olympics , said Juan Manuel Alonso of Spain , who heads the I.A.A.F. 's medical and antidoping commission . ''
2007_05_15_1847570	59	We 'd like to have more information and biomechanical studies . ''
2007_05_15_1847570	60	His own fear , Pistorius said , is that the governing body , which has not contacted him , will ban him on supposition , not science . ''
2007_05_15_1847570	61	I think they 're afraid to do the research , '' Pistorius , a business student at the University of Pretoria , said . ''
2007_05_15_1847570	62	They 're afraid of what they 're going to find , that I do n't have an advantage and they 'll have to let me compete . ''
2007_05_15_1847570	63	Pistorius , whose stated height is 6 feet 1 1/4 inches while wearing his sprinting prosthetics , says that the devices are within an allowed range determined by the length of his thighs .
2007_05_15_1847570	64	The peak length of his stride , he said , is 9 feet , not 13 feet as some I.A.A.F. officials suggest .
2007_05_15_1847570	65	There are many disadvantages to sprinting on carbon-fiber legs , Pistorius and his coach said .
2007_05_15_1847570	66	After a cumbersome start , he needs about 30 meters to gain his rhythm .
2007_05_15_1847570	67	His knees do not flex as readily , limiting his power output .
2007_05_15_1847570	68	His grip can be unsure in the rain .
2007_05_15_1847570	69	And when he runs into a headwind or grows fatigued , he must fight rotational forces that turn his prosthetic devices sideways , said Ampie Louw , who coaches Pistorius . ''
2007_05_15_1847570	70	The I.A.A.F. has got no clue about disabled sport , '' said Louw , who has coached Pistorius since 2003 .
2007_05_15_1847570	71	Insufficient credit is given to Pistorius 's resolve in the weight room and on the track , Louw said , describing one intense workout that requires him to run 350 meters in 42 seconds ; 300 meters in 34.6 seconds ; 200 meters in 22 seconds and 150 meters in 15.4 seconds . ''
2007_05_15_1847570	72	The kid is a born champion , '' Louw said . ''
2007_05_15_1847570	73	He does n't settle for second best . ''
2007_05_15_1847570	74	Having worn prosthetics since infancy , Pistorius did not have to adjust to artificial legs after he began competing , as many disabled athletes do .
2007_05_15_1847570	75	He won a gold medal in the 200 at the 2004 Paralympics in Athens . ''
2007_05_15_1847570	76	These have always been my legs , '' he said . ''
2007_05_15_1847570	77	I train harder than other guys , eat better , sleep better and wake up thinking about athletics .
2007_05_15_1847570	78	I think that 's probably why I 'm a bit of an exception . ''
2007_05_15_1847570	79	One who is attempting to broaden the definition of an Olympic athlete . ''
2007_05_15_1847570	80	You have two competing issues -- fair competition and basic human rights to compete , '' said Angela Schneider , a sports ethicist at the University of Western Ontario and a 1984 Olympic silver medalist in rowing .
2007_05_15_1847570	81	The I.A.A.F. must objectively define when prosthetic devices '' go from therapy to enhancement , '' Schneider said .
2007_05_15_1847570	82	The danger of acting hastily , she said , is '' you deny a guy 's struggle against all odds -- one of the fundamental principles of the Olympics . ''
2007_05_15_1847570	83	Correction : May 16 , 2007 , Wednesday A sports graphic yesterday with the continuation of a front-page article about Oscar Pistorius , a South African athlete who wants to be the first amputee runner to compete in the Olympics , carried incorrect renderings in some copies of the '' take-off '' phase of running .
2007_05_15_1847570	84	A corrected version can be found online .
2007_05_15_1847571	0	The heat of the day was just beginning as Brig. Gen. Dana J. H. Pittard greeted Lt. Gen. Ali Ghaidan Majid , commander of ground forces in Iraq , and the two boarded a helicopter for Diyala Province , one of the most violent areas of the country .
2007_05_15_1847571	1	General Pittard , who oversees training for the Iraqi Army , elite police and border guards , travels five days out of seven , tracking the progress of Iraqi forces as they prepare to eventually take charge of the country 's defense .
2007_05_15_1847571	2	The 56-year-old General Ali , as he is known , is a former commander in Saddam Hussein 's army who will eventually be in control of all Iraqi Army divisions , some of which still report to the Americans .
2007_05_15_1847571	3	He was imprisoned in Iraq after the Persian Gulf war in Kuwait , as were a number of other generals .
2007_05_15_1847571	4	On this trip , he was hoping to negotiate a date for the Americans to hand over control of the Fifth Division in Diyala .
2007_05_15_1847571	5	The Americans would remain in Diyala and be involved in fighting and strategizing with the Iraqis , but gaining control of the division would give General Ali a greater say in determining strategy .
2007_05_15_1847571	6	A day spent with the two men offered a glimpse into the challenges facing the Iraqi military as it tries to take a leading stabilizing role .
2007_05_15_1847571	7	Of the Iraqi Army 's 10 divisions , eight are under Iraqi control .
2007_05_15_1847571	8	Only two , the Fifth Division in Diyala and the Seventh Division in western Iraq , are still under American control .
2007_05_15_1847571	9	The Fifth Division is well equipped now and almost at full strength , but it has had a tough fight . ''
2007_05_15_1847571	10	The Fifth Iraqi Army Division is O.K. , '' said General Pittard , though he said it was still short of officers .
2007_05_15_1847571	11	Americans who have worked with the division indicated that it was better at finding the enemy than before , and discussions about strategy showed the Americans took the Iraqis ' arguments seriously .
2007_05_15_1847571	12	At one point , General Ali said he wanted to know from the Fifth Division commander if the troops were ready to join his command .
2007_05_15_1847571	13	Maj. Gen. Shakir Hulail Hussein al-Kaabi , the commander , told him that one of the division 's brigades was ready , but the others probably were not .
2007_05_15_1847571	14	When asked when they would be ready , he said the Americans had the schedule , but did not seem to know it himself .
2007_05_15_1847571	15	An American officer answered the question , putting forward an idea for moving the division over to Iraqi control in stages .
2007_05_15_1847571	16	At a meeting with the Fifth Division 's First Brigade , officers gave PowerPoint presentations on the insurgency 's activities .
2007_05_15_1847571	17	Within the First Brigade 's area , there are at least half a dozen Sunni Arab insurgent groups .
2007_05_15_1847571	18	Some have ties to Al Qaeda , some to Baathist insurgents .
2007_05_15_1847571	19	In a few areas , the Mahdi Army , a Shiite militia , is active . ''
2007_05_15_1847571	20	There are three groups operating in Balad Ruz , '' reported an Iraqi intelligence officer , using his pointer to show a town in the middle of the province . ''
2007_05_15_1847571	21	The Al Qaeda leader here is named Karah .
2007_05_15_1847571	22	They operate in small cells of six to seven people , their strategy is to emplace I.E.D.s , attack with small arms fire and force people to leave their homes , '' he said , using the abbreviation for improvised explosive devices .
2007_05_15_1847571	23	More than any American officer , he understands this province .
2007_05_15_1847571	24	He comes from Balad Ruz .
2007_05_15_1847571	25	He knows the terrain , he understands its volatile mix of Sunnis , Shiites and Kurds , he knows its tribes .
2007_05_15_1847571	26	In the briefing he asked questions about groups within tribes and which insurgents they supported .
2007_05_15_1847571	27	The insurgency is only one of his problems .
2007_05_15_1847571	28	For this division and for the entire Iraqi army , the logistics are a huge issue .
2007_05_15_1847571	29	Salaries are paid in cash and orders for pay from the division must be carried by hand to Baghdad .
2007_05_15_1847571	30	Then , dinars are loaded into trucks and moved in an armored convoy to pay the soldiers .
2007_05_15_1847571	31	It is harder still to get fuel , said Lt. Col. Michael Beaudette , who runs the military transition team for the First Brigade . ''
2007_05_15_1847571	32	The Ministry of Defense , they do n't listen to you unless you drive your fuel request to Baghdad , '' he said . ''
2007_05_15_1847571	33	It can take two weeks for something that needs five signatures . ''
2007_05_15_1847571	34	By the end of the day , General Ali had decided he wanted the division to be under his control on May 31 ; he will discuss that with Lt. Gen. Raymond T. Odierno , the commander of daily operations in Iraq .
2007_05_15_1847571	35	General Ali said he would push the idea of moving the division headquarters to the provincial capital of Baquba from its base 40 miles away . ''
2007_05_15_1847571	36	All the people in the province are saying they do not feel safe because the division headquarters is so far away from them , '' he said .
2007_05_15_1847571	37	But he was also clear that he does not want his troops left alone .
2007_05_15_1847571	38	When asked about the proposals by Democrats and a few Republicans in Congress for an American pullback , General Ali was clear -- not now , not yet , not for a while .
2007_05_15_1847571	39	How long is a while ? ''
2007_05_15_1847571	40	When we are ready , '' he said . ''
2007_05_15_1847571	41	We know we have command and control responsibility , but we still lack many things : We need artillery and air support , and logistics support and medical support , too , and the intelligence experience that the coalition has and advanced equipment they have and that we lack . '' ''
2007_05_15_1847571	42	As military people , we recognize we can not do all those things now by ourselves . ''
2007_05_15_1847572	0	The hearing that will determine whether Floyd Landis keeps his 2006 Tour de France title started Monday with legal maneuvering , dense scientific testimony and an unusual photo for the family album .
2007_05_15_1847572	1	Landis 's mother , Arlene , hustled to the front of the Darling Trial Courtroom at Pepperdine University 's School of Law , digital camera in hand , just before opening statements .
2007_05_15_1847572	2	While her son sat next to his lawyers at the defense table , she snapped one photo of him from afar .
2007_05_15_1847572	3	Then , in her traditional Mennonite white bonnet , she moved in for a close-up .
2007_05_15_1847572	4	Only after she commemorated the event did three arbitrators begin to hear arguments about whether Floyd Landis used performance-enhancing drugs during cycling 's most prestigious race .
2007_05_15_1847572	5	The United States Anti-Doping Agency has accused Landis of failing a drug test after his stunning performance during Stage 17 of the Tour de France .
2007_05_15_1847572	6	On that day last July , Landis rode solo over three Alpine passes to set himself up for victory .
2007_05_15_1847572	7	His urine sample from him that day revealed a testosterone-to-epitestosterone ratio of 11 to 1 , nearly three times the limit of four to one set by the World Anti-Doping Agency .
2007_05_15_1847572	8	A more sophisticated test also showed that traces of synthetic testosterone were in that urine sample .
2007_05_15_1847572	9	Landis 's case has dragged on for 10 months , but it seems to be approaching a conclusion .
2007_05_15_1847572	10	If he loses this appeal , he can appeal one last time to the Court of Arbitration for Sport , and that decision is final .
2007_05_15_1847572	11	The case pits Landis , 31 , against USADA , which prosecutes doping cases involving American athletes .
2007_05_15_1847572	12	If Landis loses his appeals , he would become the first Tour winner in the 103-year history of the race to be stripped of the title as a result of a doping violation .
2007_05_15_1847572	13	He could face a two-year ban from the sport .
2007_05_15_1847572	14	If the agency loses , it would be the first time it has had a charge overturned in 35 cases since it was formed in 2000 .
2007_05_15_1847572	15	During their opening arguments , lawyers for the two sides immediately began to clash .
2007_05_15_1847572	16	Landis 's lead defense lawyer , Maurice Suh , repeatedly portrayed this case as groundbreaking , saying that never before had the Tour de France winner been accused of doping . ''
2007_05_15_1847572	17	This case is not like the other cases , '' Suh said .
2007_05_15_1847572	18	Richard Young , USADA 's lead lawyer , however , said the case was typical . ''
2007_05_15_1847572	19	Despite all the attention this case has received , there 's nothing particularly unique , '' he said , adding that the positive tests for synthetic testosterone stand for themselves .
2007_05_15_1847572	20	This case is different in at least one respect : USADA is opening one of its hearings to the news media for the first time , at Landis 's request .
2007_05_15_1847572	21	A room with about 100 lawyers , reporters , witnesses and members of the public watched a summary from both sides regarding the biggest doping case in recent history .
2007_05_15_1847572	22	Young told the three arbitrators in his opening statement that there were only two questions he had to answer during the 10-day hearing . ''
2007_05_15_1847572	23	One , does this meet the criteria for a positive test ? ''
2007_05_15_1847572	24	And two , are these analytical results reliable ? ''
2007_05_15_1847572	25	He added , '' Not only does this instrument hit the bull 's - eye inside , it hits the bull 's - eye outside in the wind . ''
2007_05_15_1847572	26	Young said Landis had failed a test not just once , but eight times , for synthetic testosterone .
2007_05_15_1847572	27	Seven of his backup samples tested retroactively by the French lab showed that each had traces of synthetic testosterone , he said .
2007_05_15_1847572	28	Suh , however , said the case was more complicated . ''
2007_05_15_1847572	29	This case is an utter disaster , '' Suh said , of the way USADA has gone about prosecuting the case .
2007_05_15_1847572	30	Suh told the three arbitrators from the American Arbitration Association that USADA was basing its case on questionable science and ethics practiced by the French national anti-doping lab , which conducts drug testing for the Tour de France .
2007_05_15_1847572	31	He said he and his team would outline eight violations of the International Standard for Laboratories , a governing body that oversees laboratories sanctioned by the World Anti-Doping Agency .
2007_05_15_1847572	32	As Suh gave his opening statement , he flashed a PowerPoint presentation , which included a photograph of Landis celebrating after the Tour de France , wearing the yellow jersey .
2007_05_15_1847572	33	Seated with his lawyers Monday , Landis wore a yellow tie and a blue shirt .
2007_05_15_1847572	34	He chewed gum and sipped from a water bottle , smiling when his lawyers made a point and frowning when USADA 's lawyers said something he did not like .
2007_05_15_1847572	35	Even though the hearing gives the public a first-hand look at a doping case for the first time , it will most likely be difficult for the average cycling fan to follow because it is heavy on science but thin on the drama that has turned Landis into a pariah for some , and for others into a hero who is fighting the system .
2007_05_15_1847572	36	The tone of the hearing is not likely to change .
2007_05_15_1847572	37	USADA called two witnesses Monday and has several more to go .
2007_05_15_1847572	38	Landis 's side expects to call 12 to 15 witnesses , including doctors and scientific experts .
2007_05_15_1847572	39	Landis is used to defending himself .
2007_05_15_1847572	40	When he failed a doping test last summer , he initiated an unprecedented public-relations campaign against anti-doping authorities .
2007_05_15_1847572	41	He contended that his urine samples were mishandled and that the results were misinterpreted .
2007_05_15_1847572	42	Landis and his lawyers posted their defense in PowerPoint form on Landis 's Web site .
2007_05_15_1847572	43	Landis has also toured the country , conducting town-hall meetings with a cover charge and raising money for his defense .
2007_05_15_1847572	44	In interviews , Landis has called USADA 's case against him a witch hunt .
2007_05_15_1847572	45	He has attacked the agency , as well as the World Anti-Doping Agency and the French lab , accusing them of being unethical and unfair .
2007_05_15_1847572	46	At the same time , United States Anti-Doping Agency officials were silent , saying they could not discuss an ongoing case .
2007_05_15_1847572	47	Now , both sides can be heard .
2007_05_15_1847572	48	In the meantime , the sport of cycling continues to take hits .
2007_05_15_1847572	49	Champion after champion has been implicated in doping scandals , including Ivan Basso , the 2006 Giro d'Italia winner , who last week admitted a connection to a Spanish doping investigation .
2007_05_15_1847572	50	He said he attempted to dope but never actually went through with it .
2007_05_15_1847572	51	He faces up to a two-year ban .
2007_05_15_1847572	52	On Monday , the Italian Olympic Committee recommended the Italian Cycling Federation suspend Basso for his involvement with the doctor at the center of a Spanish drug ring .
2007_05_15_1847572	53	Spanish law enforcement has linked more than 100 riders to the doping ring , and International Cycling Union officials have been pushing to pursue its own cases against those riders .
2007_05_15_1847572	54	But Landis 's case has received more attention than any others .
2007_05_15_1847572	55	His downfall began with a breathtaking ride during Stage 17 of the Tour .
2007_05_15_1847572	56	On July 20 , riding on a hip that badly needed surgery , Landis climbed to third place over all after struggling and plunging to 11th the day before .
2007_05_15_1847572	57	From that point , it seemed that Landis could very well be the heir to Lance Armstrong , the seven-time Tour winner .
2007_05_15_1847572	58	Before becoming the Tour champion , Landis helped Armstrong win three of his Tour titles .
2007_05_15_1847572	59	Then , last summer , Landis won the race himself .
2007_05_15_1847572	60	Three days later , his celebration ended .
2007_05_15_1847572	61	After French scientists found the abnormal testosterone-to-epitestosterone ratio , the next step for them was to conduct a carbon isotope ratio test , which examines the atomic makeup of testosterone in the urine and can determine if it is natural or synthetic .
2007_05_15_1847572	62	That test revealed the presence of synthetic testosterone in Landis 's sample .
2007_05_15_1847572	63	Immediately , Landis professed his innocence , saying he had never used performance-enhancing drugs and was shocked at the testosterone abnormality .
2007_05_15_1847572	64	Now he will get the chance to prove his case , officially . ''
2007_05_15_1847572	65	I 'm excited to get the case under way , '' Landis said before the hearing began , according The Associated Press . ''
2007_05_15_1847572	66	I hope the arbitrators rule fairly and on the facts .
2007_05_15_1847572	67	I 'm confident if they do , I 'll retain my title and be racing again . ''
2007_05_15_1847576	0	What is it that some parents do n't understand about the HPV vaccine , licensed last summer in hopes of preventing most cases of genital warts and cervical cancer ?
2007_05_15_1847576	1	That infections with human papillomavirus , or HPV , are the most common sexually transmitted diseases ?
2007_05_15_1847576	2	That there is no treatment for HPV infections ?
2007_05_15_1847576	3	That cervical cancer is the most serious sexually transmitted disease caused by this virus ?
2007_05_15_1847576	4	That 70 percent of cases of cervical cancer arise because of two variants of the virus that the new vaccine protects against ?
2007_05_15_1847576	5	That 90 percent of genital herpes cases are caused by two other variants of the virus that are countered by the vaccine ?
2007_05_15_1847576	6	That most people infected with HPV do not know it , yet can transmit the virus to an unsuspecting sexual partner ?
2007_05_15_1847576	7	That 20 percent of American girls 14 to 19 are infected , and the vaccine works only if administered before women contract the viral variants it is intended to prevent ?
2007_05_15_1847576	8	Despite these facts , the vaccine , sold by Merck as Gardasil , has been mired in controversy , and many parents remain wary about using it for the girls and young women it was meant to protect .
2007_05_15_1847576	9	Are the Objections Valid ?
2007_05_15_1847576	10	One commonly voiced thought is that immunizing young girls against HPV will encourage promiscuity and that the message to these youngsters should be abstinence before marriage and monogamy after .
2007_05_15_1847576	11	But the abstinence message is rarely effective .
2007_05_15_1847576	12	Half of all girls become sexually active before graduating from high school .
2007_05_15_1847576	13	For some girls and women , sexual behavior occurs against their will , through rape , incest and date rape .
2007_05_15_1847576	14	Why would this vaccine give girls license to be sexually indulgent ?
2007_05_15_1847576	15	It protects against only one sexually transmitted problem , and there are so many others , including chlamydia , trichomoniasis , H.I.V. and , of course , unwanted pregnancy .
2007_05_15_1847576	16	Another concern involves long-term safety .
2007_05_15_1847576	17	How do we know this vaccine will not eventually cause other problems like autoimmune or neurological disorders or lose its protective powers or foster the dominance of other HPV variants ?
2007_05_15_1847576	18	Actually , we do n't .
2007_05_15_1847576	19	But we do have at least five years of safety data that include no hints of long-term risks or waning effectiveness .
2007_05_15_1847576	20	But if the vaccine should begin to lose potency over time , that could easily be remedied by a booster shot .
2007_05_15_1847576	21	In response to suggestions of mandatory HPV vaccination for all girls entering high school , opponents have objected to '' forcing '' therapy on healthy girls under the presumption that future behavior might result in a disease .
2007_05_15_1847576	22	This is exactly the principle on which every form of immunization is based .
2007_05_15_1847576	23	Not everyone contracted polio or smallpox before the advent of mandatory vaccines to protect every child .
2007_05_15_1847576	24	We vaccinate the masses , causing herd immunity , to protect the relatively few who would otherwise become ill and suffer devastating consequences .
2007_05_15_1847576	25	Finally , objections have been raised about costs .
2007_05_15_1847576	26	This vaccine is not cheap .
2007_05_15_1847576	27	Each dose costs $ 120 , or $ 360 for the three doses needed for full protection , far more than any other commonly used vaccine .
2007_05_15_1847576	28	If a booster shot is needed later , that could mean another $ 120 .
2007_05_15_1847576	29	If the vaccine is made mandatory , states might have to pay for immunizing girls not covered by insurance .
2007_05_15_1847576	30	Still , HPV infections are far more costly .
2007_05_15_1847576	31	As noted in the March issue of The American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology : '' The annual burden of cervical HPV-related disease ranges from $ 2.25 billion to $ 4.6 billion in the United States .
2007_05_15_1847576	32	The annual burden of cervical cancer ranges from $ 181.5 million to $ 363 million . ''
2007_05_15_1847576	33	This is not to mention the physical and emotional costs of cervical cancer to affected women , most of whom can no longer have children and some of whom die of the disease .
2007_05_15_1847576	34	A Common Infection An estimated 20 million Americans are infected with HPV , and 6.2 percent of girls 15 to 19 become infected each year .
2007_05_15_1847576	35	All told , more than six million new HPV infections occur annually , 74 percent of them in people 15 to 24 .
2007_05_15_1847576	36	Human papillomaviruses are ubiquitous , and HPV infections are more the norm than the exception .
2007_05_15_1847576	37	At least half of sexually active men and women acquire genital HPV infections at some point in their lives .
2007_05_15_1847576	38	A recent estimate suggests that by age 50 , 80 percent of women will have acquired genital HPV .
2007_05_15_1847576	39	Not all HPV infections would be prevented by the new vaccine .
2007_05_15_1847576	40	There are about 30 variants of the virus that commonly infect men and women .
2007_05_15_1847576	41	Although the vaccine prevents only four , these four are critically important , because they account for vast majorities of cases of both genital warts and cervical cancer .
2007_05_15_1847576	42	Still , because 30 percent of cervical cancers are because of HPV variants not included in the vaccine , even if a woman is fully immunized , she still needs regular Pap smears .
2007_05_15_1847576	43	There are no treatments for HPV infections .
2007_05_15_1847576	44	Most of the time , they are eliminated by the immune system in a matter of months without causing any signs of disease .
2007_05_15_1847576	45	It is only those virus infections that linger that can become troublesome in the long run .
2007_05_15_1847576	46	But with 11,000 cases of cervical cancer in the United States each year , there are enough viral infections that are not cleared naturally to result in a devastating , and now mostly preventable , health problem .
2007_05_15_1847576	47	Wide use of Pap smears has done wonders to greatly reduce cervical cancer deaths among American women .
2007_05_15_1847576	48	In developing countries , where most women do not have Pap smears , this cancer is rampant and a major cause of death .
2007_05_15_1847576	49	Protection for Men Too The only sure way to prevent an HPV infection is to remain abstinent and avoid all genital contact .
2007_05_15_1847576	50	The virus can be transmitted even if a woman stops short of sexual intercourse .
2007_05_15_1847576	51	Condoms do not provide full protection .
2007_05_15_1847576	52	Alternatively , a woman could be protected if she had only one sexual partner and remained monogamous for life , but she would need a guarantee that her partner behaved similarly .
2007_05_15_1847576	53	This is why the national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends routine vaccination with three doses of Gardasil for girls 11 to 12 ( it is licensed for use in girls from 9 to 26 ) , with luck before they have become sexually active .
2007_05_15_1847576	54	But even if a woman has already had an HPV infection , the vaccine could help protect her from other disease-causing variants .
2007_05_15_1847576	55	In the name of equality , some advocates urge that boys , too , be immunized , because they spread the infection to women .
2007_05_15_1847576	56	In fact , men may benefit directly from the vaccine , because the virus can also cause cancers of the penis and anus .
2007_05_15_1847576	57	Anal cancer is a particular concern to gay men , and a study is under way to determine whether the new vaccine will protect gay men from cancer .
2007_05_15_1847576	58	The vaccine should not be given to women who are or may be pregnant .
2007_05_15_1847576	59	Nor should it be used for anyone who is allergic to its ingredients .
2007_05_15_1847576	60	As with all vaccines , Gardasil can cause temporary side effects .
2007_05_15_1847576	61	They may include pain , swelling , itching and redness at the injection site , as well as fever , nausea and dizziness .
2007_05_15_1847576	62	PERSONAL HEALTH Correction : May 16 , 2007 , Wednesday The Personal Health column in Science Times yesterday , about the vaccine for human papillomavirus , misstated a condition caused by two variants of the virus .
2007_05_15_1847576	63	They cause 90 percent of cases of genital warts , not genital herpes .
2007_05_15_1847578	0	'' ` Survivor : Fiji , '' the 14th edition of the CBS franchise , came to a close Sunday with the lowest ratings ever for a '' Survivor '' finale .
2007_05_15_1847578	1	Winning by a unanimous vote , a first for the show , an advertising executive , Earl Cole , left , took home the $ 1 million prize , as 13.6 million viewers tuned in for the finale from 8 to 10 p.m. , Nielsen estimated .
2007_05_15_1847578	2	Among adults 18 to 49 , the show 's ratings were down 21 percent compared with the fall finale of '' Survivor : Cook Islands '' and 27 percent compared with the finale of the '' Panama '' edition a year ago .
2007_05_15_1847578	3	CBS still managed to finish the night as the most-watched network over all , but in the 18-to-49 demographic it ranked second to ABC , whose drama '' Desperate Housewives '' remained unbeatable at 9 ( 15.8 million ) despite posting record low ratings of its own .
2007_05_15_1847578	4	At 10 , CBS 's '' Survivor '' reunion special ( 12.1 million ) tied ABC 's '' Brothers & Sisters '' ( 11.9 million ) for first .
2007_05_15_1847578	5	Fox ranked a distant third for the night , and NBC trailed close behind in fourth with a low-rated broadcast of the movie '' Shrek '' from 8 to 10 ( 6.3 million ) .
2007_05_15_1847579	0	Members of the military will not be allowed to use military computers to communicate through Web sites like YouTube and MySpace under restrictions that the Pentagon imposed yesterday .
2007_05_15_1847579	1	The rule bans 13 sites , many of them networking , music or photo-sharing sites , because they have slowed the Internet network of the Defense Department , military officials said . ''
2007_05_15_1847579	2	This whole action is about freeing up space on the network , '' said Mike Thiem , a spokesman for the Defense Information Systems Agency . ''
2007_05_15_1847579	3	There was careful thought given to which sites were chosen .
2007_05_15_1847579	4	This was not an arbitrary decision by any means . ''
2007_05_15_1847579	5	Mr. Thiem said that the ban applied just to military computers and that soldiers and others were free to use the 13 sites , which include MTV.com , through personal computers or at private Internet cafes on military bases .
2007_05_15_1847579	6	Sites that offer personal pages like MySpace and those that provide streaming audio and video feeds have long been blocked from Pentagon computers in Iraq and Afghanistan , military officials said .
2007_05_15_1847579	7	It is unclear how soldiers in war zones will be affected .
2007_05_15_1847579	8	Critics said the policy represented the latest effort to control the deluge of information flowing from soldiers on the battlefield . ''
2007_05_15_1847579	9	The Army has been flooded with young soldiers who have laptops , iPods , digital cameras , recorders , and that has put the fear of god into some of the generals , '' said Matthew Burden , an Army veteran who writes a widely read military blog , www.Blackfive.net .
2007_05_15_1847579	10	Mr. Burden said the Army recently tightened restrictions on soldiers with blogs , requiring them to register their blogs and submit content for review . ''
2007_05_15_1847579	11	I think all of these restrictions are going to end up blocking the connection we have to the war zone , which is unfortunate , '' he said .
2007_05_15_1847579	12	Becky Davis , whose son is serving in Iraq , helps write a blog for the group Military Families Voice of Victory .
2007_05_15_1847579	13	As part of the blog , Ms. Davis occasionally provides YouTube links to reports that she thinks soldiers will find interesting .
2007_05_15_1847579	14	She said she was unsure whether the links would be blocked . ''
2007_05_15_1847579	15	I am concerned about how this directive is going to impact the families , '' Ms. Davis said .
2007_05_15_1847579	16	Another former soldier said the major effect would be on morale overseas . ''
2007_05_15_1847579	17	These sites are like modern-day forms of writing letters , the same sorts of letters that soldiers in the trench holes in World War II wrote , '' said Corey Robinson , 22 , who served a total of 20 months in Iraq and Afghanistan in the Army . ''
2007_05_15_1847579	18	When we were able to use the Internet , there was a huge difference in our morale , '' Mr. Robinson said .
2007_05_15_1847579	19	Mr. Thiem said the ban would hardly hamper communication between battlefront and homefront .
2007_05_15_1847579	20	He emphasized that , in addition to Internet cafes and their own computers , soldiers could also use regulated portals to speak with friends and family at home . ''
2007_05_15_1847579	21	There are alternative ways of communicating with loved ones , '' Mr. Thiem said . ''
2007_05_15_1847579	22	No one is trying to prevent that from happening . ''
2007_05_15_1847580	0	The International Committee of the Red Cross , in a confidential report about East Jerusalem and its surrounding areas , accuses Israel of a '' general disregard '' for '' its obligations under international humanitarian law -- and the law of occupation in particular . ''
2007_05_15_1847580	1	The committee , which does not accept Israel 's annexation of East Jerusalem , says Israel is using its rights as an occupying power under international law '' in order to further its own interests or those of its own population to the detriment of the population of the occupied territory . ''
2007_05_15_1847580	2	With the construction of the separation barrier , the establishment of an outer ring of Jewish settlements beyond the expanded municipal boundaries and the creation of a dense road network linking the different Israeli neighborhoods and settlements in and outside Jerusalem , the report says , Israel is '' reshaping the development of the Jerusalem metropolitan area '' with '' far-reaching humanitarian consequences . ''
2007_05_15_1847580	3	Those include the increasing isolation of Palestinians living in Jerusalem from the rest of the West Bank and the increasing difficulty for some Palestinians to easily reach Jerusalem 's schools and hospitals .
2007_05_15_1847580	4	The Red Cross committee , which is recognized as a guardian of humanitarian law under the Geneva Conventions of 1949 , does not publish its reports but provides them in confidence to the parties involved and to a small number of countries .
2007_05_15_1847580	5	This report was provided to The New York Times by someone outside the organization who wanted the report 's conclusions publicized .
2007_05_15_1847580	6	The leak came just days before Israel 's celebration of Jerusalem Day this Wednesday , observing the 40th anniversary of the unification of the city .
2007_05_15_1847580	7	The committee is better known for its role in visiting prisoners all over the world to try to ensure humanitarian conditions .
2007_05_15_1847580	8	It has been involved for decades with the Israeli-Palestinian situation as part of its role in upholding the Geneva Conventions , which cover the responsibilities of occupying countries .
2007_05_15_1847580	9	But its reports rarely surface .
2007_05_15_1847580	10	The report considers all land that Israel conquered in the 1967 war to be occupied territory .
2007_05_15_1847580	11	It was the result of nine months of work by the committee and was delivered in late February '' to Israel and to a small number of foreign governments we believe would be in the best position to help support our efforts for the implementation of humanitarian law , '' said Bernard Barrett , a spokesman for the committee in Jerusalem .
2007_05_15_1847580	12	Israeli officials said that they respected the committee and that they had cooperated with it gladly on issues ranging from the release of captured Israeli soldiers to asking its officials to give briefings on international law to Israeli diplomats and commanders serving in the occupied West Bank .
2007_05_15_1847580	13	They confirmed having received the report , but disagreed with its premises and conclusions . ''
2007_05_15_1847580	14	We reject the premise of the report , that East Jerusalem is occupied territory , '' said Mark Regev , spokesman for the Israeli Foreign Ministry . ''
2007_05_15_1847580	15	Israel annexed Jerusalem in 1967 and offered full citizenship at the time to all of Jerusalem 's residents .
2007_05_15_1847580	16	These are facts that can not be ignored . ''
2007_05_15_1847580	17	Israel , he said , '' is committed to a diverse and pluralistic Jerusalem , to improving the conditions of all the city 's inhabitants and to protecting their interests as part of our sovereign responsibility . ''
2007_05_15_1847580	18	He added , '' If any population in Jerusalem is thriving and growing , it is the Arab population . ''
2007_05_15_1847580	19	He also noted that Israel made great efforts to ensure health care for Palestinians , pointing to 81,000 entry permits in 2006 for Palestinians needing care inside Israel .
2007_05_15_1847580	20	Conditions have worsened for Palestinians in East Jerusalem , which has long had inferior services .
2007_05_15_1847580	21	Security restrictions and the barrier that runs around and through parts of East Jerusalem were Israel 's response to suicide bombings after 2000 , but they made it much more difficult for Palestinians to move into and out of Jerusalem .
2007_05_15_1847580	22	It is virtually impossible for Palestinians from the West Bank or Gaza to move to Jerusalem if they were not born in the city ; even visiting requires a permit that can be hard to get .
2007_05_15_1847580	23	Natural population growth and building restrictions in Arab parts of the city means that large families often share very small apartments .
2007_05_15_1847580	24	Palestinians argue that the building restrictions are meant to suppress the growth of the their community ; the Israelis counter that zoning restrictions are imposed throughout the city .
2007_05_15_1847580	25	The Red Cross report notes that the separation barrier '' was undertaken with an undeniable security aim , '' but adds , '' The route of the West Bank barrier is also following a demographic logic , enclosing the settlement blocs around the city while excluding built-up Palestinian areas ( thus creating isolated Palestinian enclaves ) . ''
2007_05_15_1847580	26	Mustafa Barghouti , spokesman for the Palestinian unity government , welcomed the report , calling it consistent with the rulings of the International Court of Justice , which said in a nonbinding opinion in 2004 that Israel 's security barrier was illegal where it crossed the 1967 lines into occupied territory . ''
2007_05_15_1847580	27	Israel violates international law with impunity , and could n't continue this blunt violation for 40 years if it did not feel impunity toward the international community , '' Mr. Barghouti said .
2007_05_15_1847581	0	The Palestinian interior minister , Hani al-Qawasmeh , resigned Monday , and four more Palestinians were killed in fierce factional gun battles .
2007_05_15_1847581	1	Mr. Qawasmeh , who has been unable to control either the Fatah or the Hamas forces , said he had not been given authority to direct the security forces that were supposed to be under his control .
2007_05_15_1847581	2	Prime Minister Ismail Haniya , of Hamas , said he would take over the Interior Ministry temporarily .
2007_05_15_1847581	3	But the resignation and the bloodshed put enormous strain on the unity government .
2007_05_15_1847581	4	Mr. Qawasmeh was a compromise candidate approved by Fatah and Hamas , but neither accepted his authority .
2007_05_15_1847581	5	His resignation followed the worst outbreak of factional violence in Gaza since Hamas and Fatah reached the agreement in Mecca , Saudi Arabia , on Feb. 8 to form a unity government .
2007_05_15_1847581	6	The clashes , which have left at least nine Palestinians dead and dozens wounded since Sunday , together with the resignation , are being viewed in Gaza as signs that the government may collapse . ''
2007_05_15_1847581	7	From the beginning , I faced obstacles that robbed the ministry of its powers and made my position empty , without authority , '' Mr. Qawasmeh told reporters .
2007_05_15_1847581	8	A spokesman for Hamas , Fawzi Barhoum , blamed Fatah , and particularly the elite Presidential Guard , which is loyal to Mahmoud Abbas , the Palestinian president and Fatah leader , for the latest round of bloodletting .
2007_05_15_1847581	9	The clashes started after Fatah had sent forces into the streets without coordinating the action with Mr. Qawasmeh or Hamas .
2007_05_15_1847581	10	But Mr. Barhoum said that Hamas '' is still committed to the agreement and wo n't allow Fatah to drive us away from it . ''
2007_05_15_1847581	11	Privately , Hamas activists contend that Fatah is trying to bring about the failure of the government , in which Fatah serves as a junior partner .
2007_05_15_1847581	12	Fatah blames Hamas for the violence .
2007_05_15_1847581	13	An cease-fire brokered by the Egyptians was supposed to go into effect at 1 a.m. on Monday , but Maher Miqdad , a spokesman for Fatah , said Hamas took that as the signal '' for an explosion . '' ''
2007_05_15_1847581	14	They raided the intelligence headquarters ; they tried to raid my house , '' Mr. Miqdad said , adding that members of Al Aksa Martyrs Brigades , Fatah 's militia , and his own bodyguards confronted the attackers .
2007_05_15_1847581	15	Two Fatah men were killed in the fighting , including one of the bodyguards .
2007_05_15_1847581	16	Mr. Miqdad is known to be close to Muhammad Dahlan , a Fatah strongman in Gaza who was recently named national security adviser by Mr. Abbas .
2007_05_15_1847581	17	Mr. Dahlan is despised by Hamas , and his appointment has been a particular source of tension .
2007_05_15_1847581	18	Palestinian officials said Mr. Qawasmeh had complained that the ministry 's director general , Rashid Abu Shbak , another close Dahlan ally , had been obstructing his work and unilaterally giving orders to Fatah-controlled security forces .
2007_05_15_1847581	19	Under the Mecca agreement , the interior minister was to be an independent chosen by Hamas and approved by Fatah , rather than a member of either group .
2007_05_15_1847581	20	Mr. Qawasmeh , a former civil servant with no security expertise or political strength , was a compromise candidate .
2007_05_15_1847581	21	He had drafted a security plan , calling for sending large numbers of forces onto the streets of Gaza to restore order .
2007_05_15_1847581	22	But on Thursday , Fatah , which dominates the security forces in the Palestinian Authority , sent out a few thousand men without consulting with Hamas or with Mr. Qawasmeh , leading to the first clashes .
2007_05_15_1847581	23	Members of Hamas 's Executive Force , which was set up to counter the official security apparatus , have taken part in the fighting , along with Hamas 's underground Qassam Brigades .
2007_05_15_1847581	24	Uniformed members of the security forces loyal to Fatah have joined in , alongside Aksa Brigades militiamen .
2007_05_15_1847581	25	Muhammad Mansour , 27 , a Ministry of Education employee , described from his bed in Gaza 's Shifa Hospital how he was attacked on Sunday by , he said , Fatah forces . ''
2007_05_15_1847581	26	They took our IDs , our cellphones , blindfolded us and took us to Shalihat , '' a private beach close to the president 's office , Mr. Mansour said .
2007_05_15_1847581	27	He said he was badly beaten and accused of belonging to Hamas . ''
2007_05_15_1847581	28	I said no , '' Mr. Mansour said . ''
2007_05_15_1847581	29	One said , ` You have a brother working for the Executive Force . '
2007_05_15_1847581	30	I said I have another brother working for the police .
2007_05_15_1847581	31	Then they shot at my thighs , saying , ` This is for your brother that works for the Executive Force . ' ''
2007_05_15_1847581	32	Fatah supporters being treated in another hospital , Al Quds al Dawli , reported similar experiences at the hands of Hamas .
2007_05_15_1847581	33	The unity government , sworn in two months ago , was formed to try to end the diplomatic and economic embargo imposed by many countries after Hamas came to power in elections in January 2006 .
2007_05_15_1847581	34	The embargo is still in effect .
2007_05_15_1847581	35	The new government also was seen as a way to end factional violence that threatened to escalate into civil war .
2007_05_15_1847581	36	On Monday , Ahmed Yusuf , another spokesman for Hamas , said that the prime minister and the president were anxious to prevent further escalation of the violence , and that they had agreed to set up a joint operations room in Gaza . ''
2007_05_15_1847581	37	It is too early to say where this will all go , '' said Mahdi Abdul Hadi , the director of Passia , an independent Palestinian research organization . ''
2007_05_15_1847581	38	The Mecca agreement was more a declaration of principles .
2007_05_15_1847581	39	It was never fully endorsed by the grass-roots factions of Fatah and Hamas on the ground . ''
2007_05_15_1847581	40	He added that what the Palestinians are looking for is '' a hero , not a leader , '' someone who is '' willing to take the risk of acting '' to restore order on the ground , and to accept the consequences .
2007_05_15_1847581	41	So far , he said , neither Mr. Haniya nor Mr. Abbas has taken any firm action .
2007_05_15_1847583	0	The far-flung family that controls Dow Jones & Company met by phone yesterday to discuss a pledge by Rupert Murdoch to give them a seat on the board of his News Corporation if it buys Dow Jones , and to guard the independence of the Dow Jones trophy property , The Wall Street Journal .
2007_05_15_1847583	1	Members of the Bancroft family declined to comment on the meeting .
2007_05_15_1847583	2	But people close to the family said they saw little new in Mr. Murdoch 's missive and nothing that would soften family members ' initial opposition to the deal .
2007_05_15_1847583	3	In a letter to the Bancrofts , who own a controlling interest in Dow Jones and initially rejected his $ 5 billion offer , Mr. Murdoch asked to meet with them , to continue making his case for a takeover in person .
2007_05_15_1847583	4	The text of the letter , dated May 11 , was made public yesterday by the Web site of The Journal and confirmed by the News Corporation .
2007_05_15_1847583	5	Many Bancroft family members , according to people who know them , object to Mr. Murdoch 's brand of journalism , arguing that he might bend The Journal 's news coverage to suit his business interests and conservative political views .
2007_05_15_1847583	6	Mr. Murdoch addressed such concerns directly in his letter , as he did in an earlier missive to the family , presenting himself and the family as products of the same newspaper traditions . ''
2007_05_15_1847583	7	Much has been written about me , my family and our company , some flattering , some not ; some accurate , most not , '' he wrote .
2007_05_15_1847583	8	He said that he would give the family a seat on the News Corporation board , and would establish an editorial board to oversee The Journal , as he did at The Times of London , to protect its top editors from capricious dismissal and to mediate disputes between the newspaper and the corporation .
2007_05_15_1847583	9	He had made the same commitments already in the two weeks since the takeover offer became public knowledge . ''
2007_05_15_1847583	10	It seems like he 's just repeating the things he 's already expressed publicly in interviews and in his original letter , '' said James H. Ottaway Jr. , a former Dow Jones board member who worked with the Bancrofts for more than three decades .
2007_05_15_1847583	11	Mr. Ottaway , whose family owns 5.2 percent of the voting power in the company 's stock , has publicly stated his reluctance to sell to anyone , and his adamant opposition to a takeover by Mr. Murdoch . ''
2007_05_15_1847583	12	I do n't see that it advanced his case particularly , and I would doubt that it would change the Bancrofts ' position , '' he said of the letter .
2007_05_15_1847583	13	But the fact that the family conferred yesterday could indicate that some of its members do not want to let the matter drop .
2007_05_15_1847583	14	Mr. Murdoch 's $ 60-a-share offer was a steep premium for a stock that had recently traded around $ 35 to $ 36 , and word of it caused the price to soar .
2007_05_15_1847583	15	Shares of Dow Jones closed yesterday at $ 53.77 .
2007_05_15_1847583	16	Perhaps as important as his promise to protect Dow Jones 's integrity was Mr. Murdoch 's promise to invest in the company , which increasingly must compete against much larger providers of news and financial information . ''
2007_05_15_1847583	17	We believe that News Corporation could bring substantial resources to bear in a combined enterprise , providing the additional capital and scale that will preserve Dow Jones 's leadership and growth for generations to come , '' he wrote .
2007_05_15_1847583	18	Separately , a group of Journal reporters based in China urged the Bancroft family in a letter to reject Mr. Murdoch 's bid .
2007_05_15_1847583	19	The letter , written May 10 , said the Journal 's integrity could be compromised because Mr. Murdoch is well-known for making editorial decisions in China to serve News Corporation 's business interests there .
2007_05_15_1847583	20	The letter was signed by seven reporters , including many who were members of a team that won the Pulitzer Prize for international reporting this year for the paper 's coverage of the consequences of China 's aggressive economic growth .
2007_05_15_1847585	0	ISARIS BAEZ is 11 and waiting for heart surgery .
2007_05_15_1847585	1	It gets a little boring being in a hospital all day .
2007_05_15_1847585	2	So she was happily surprised last Wednesday when she learned that there was to be a screening of '' TMNT , '' the latest Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie , followed by a poetry jam .
2007_05_15_1847585	3	I like to write poetry , '' said Isaris , who lives in Washington Heights .
2007_05_15_1847585	4	She and nine other children walked into a boardroom at Morgan Stanley Children 's Hospital of NewYork-Presbyterian , at Broadway and West 165th Street .
2007_05_15_1847585	5	Others had on hospital gowns and slippers .
2007_05_15_1847585	6	Most were accompanied by an ever-present IV drip .
2007_05_15_1847585	7	They were handed tickets and whisked to their seats .
2007_05_15_1847585	8	Once the film began , the children , whose illnesses included cancer and heart disease , were rapt .
2007_05_15_1847585	9	By the time the movie ended , only four children remained .
2007_05_15_1847585	10	The others had returned to their rooms , exhausted .
2007_05_15_1847585	11	That 's when Robert Galinsky , a writer , actor and director , sprang to the front of the room . ''
2007_05_15_1847585	12	What is a poem ? ''
2007_05_15_1847585	13	said 11-year-old Quadri . ''
2007_05_15_1847585	14	said 10-year-old Terrell . ''
2007_05_15_1847585	15	Mr. Galinsky wrote the words on a sheet of blank paper .
2007_05_15_1847585	16	Then he asked the children what some of the movie 's themes were . ''
2007_05_15_1847585	17	Brotherhood , '' they replied . ''
2007_05_15_1847585	18	Working together . '' ''
2007_05_15_1847585	19	It was funny , '' Terrell offered . ''
2007_05_15_1847585	20	Do you find there 's a lot of funny stuff in your life ? ''
2007_05_15_1847585	21	Terrell shook his head . ''
2007_05_15_1847585	22	There 's no comedy in my life . ''
2007_05_15_1847585	23	Mr. Galinsky added words to the list , and soon the makings of a poem began to emerge : '' Brotherhood is working together/I want adventure forever/There is no comedy in my life/There is action/There is music/There is drama . ''
2007_05_15_1847585	24	The movie and poetry program is sponsored by the Lollipop Theater Network , which shows first-run films to terminally and chronically ill children in hospitals nationwide , and the We Are Family Foundation , which promotes tolerance among children .
2007_05_15_1847585	25	The poetry themes that the children come up with often revolve around '' alienation , antagonism , bullying , someone being the victim , '' said Mr. Galinsky , 42 . ''
2007_05_15_1847585	26	They tie in to how the kids are living their lives in the face of other children who are healthy . ''
2007_05_15_1847585	27	He said he almost never sees the same face twice because a child has either been discharged or died . ''
2007_05_15_1847585	28	It 's not always easy , '' he said .
2007_05_15_1847585	29	Back in the hospital boardroom , Mr. Galinsky sought a word that rhymed with '' drama . ''
2007_05_15_1847585	30	Quadri came up with '' fama . '' ''
2007_05_15_1847585	31	Not a real word , but sure , we can use it , '' said Mr. Galinsky . ''
2007_05_15_1847585	32	Everything counts in here . ''
2007_05_15_1847585	33	They decided to call the poem '' Stand Together , Forgive Forever . ''
2007_05_15_1847585	34	They read it aloud in unison , and then Mr. Galinsky typed it up and presented copies to them in their rooms . ''
2007_05_15_1847585	35	I liked it 'cause we got to work on it together , '' Isaris said .
2007_05_15_1847586	0	Before Lou Piniella left home for spring training in February , he had lunch with an old friend . ''
2007_05_15_1847586	1	I had lunch with George , '' he said yesterday , referring to the man who had employed him as a player , coach , manager , general manager and broadcaster .
2007_05_15_1847586	2	Piniella and George Steinbrenner , the Yankees ' principal owner , are longtime fellow residents of Tampa , Fla. .
2007_05_15_1847586	3	Steinbrenner , as a result of age or health , has virtually disappeared from public view .
2007_05_15_1847586	4	But that day in Tampa , he sat across from Piniella as they ate at the Capital Grille . ''
2007_05_15_1847586	5	We sat there for about two hours and talked about old times and baseball in general , '' Piniella said before the Cubs lost to the Mets , 5-4 , last night . ''
2007_05_15_1847586	6	The conversation ended , ` Let 's hope the Cubs and the Yankees meet in the World Series . ' ''
2007_05_15_1847586	7	Piniella was at Shea Stadium as the first-year manager of the Chicago Cubs , who have n't played in the World Series since 1945 and have n't won the World Series since 1908 .
2007_05_15_1847586	8	Last fall , when Steinbrenner briefly considered firing Joe Torre as the Yankees ' manager after a first-round playoff loss to the Detroit Tigers , Piniella was promoted as a possible replacement , though not by anyone on the Yankees .
2007_05_15_1847586	9	The speculation , Piniella said , kept him from socializing with Steinbrenner . ''
2007_05_15_1847586	10	I did n't want people to think I was looking for any favors , '' Piniella said . ''
2007_05_15_1847586	11	Now that I 'm employed and I 'm out of the picture , we can get together a little more and talk some baseball .
2007_05_15_1847586	12	I really like Mr. Steinbrenner . ''
2007_05_15_1847586	13	After Piniella completed his second tenure as Steinbrenner 's manager in 1988 , he said there would not be a third tenure .
2007_05_15_1847586	14	What if Steinbrenner had wanted him to manage the Yankees this season ?
2007_05_15_1847586	15	It was an easy question for Piniella to answer from the security of his three-year , $ 10 million contract with the Cubs . ''
2007_05_15_1847586	16	I 'm happy where I 'm at , '' he said , standing in his office in the visiting clubhouse , pausing in the midst of changing into his Cubs uniform . ''
2007_05_15_1847586	17	I did it twice in New York .
2007_05_15_1847586	18	I 'd work for the Yankees in some capacity -- a scout , an adviser , something like that .
2007_05_15_1847586	19	I would n't want to manage , and I wo n't .
2007_05_15_1847586	20	This is my last job .
2007_05_15_1847586	21	I 've got three years , and that 's going to be ample time to get this job done here . ''
2007_05_15_1847586	22	Chicago has been a graveyard for managers .
2007_05_15_1847586	23	Piniella is the 36th manager the Cubs have had in the 62 years since they last played in the World Series .
2007_05_15_1847586	24	Some frustrated Cubs fans , desperate for a championship , viewed Piniella as a miracle worker .
2007_05_15_1847586	25	Scoffing at that idea and putting the Cubs in perspective , the 63-year-old Piniella said : '' This team lost a lot of games last year .
2007_05_15_1847586	26	We 've added some nice pieces .
2007_05_15_1847586	27	It 's going to take a little bit to get this thing to jell .
2007_05_15_1847586	28	We 've got some work to do with this club .
2007_05_15_1847586	29	We still have some areas to improve . ''
2007_05_15_1847586	30	The Cubs led the National League in losses last year with 96 .
2007_05_15_1847586	31	After losing last night to the Mets , they are two games under .500 and have been over .500 -- by a game each time -- on only three days . ''
2007_05_15_1847586	32	We have n't played bad baseball , '' Piniella said . ''
2007_05_15_1847586	33	Our record is below .500 , but we 've played hard .
2007_05_15_1847586	34	We have n't played well in close games .
2007_05_15_1847586	35	It 's a little disconcerting .
2007_05_15_1847586	36	It 's a little worrisome .
2007_05_15_1847586	37	You want to win the close games , but when you lose 96 games the year before , that takes a while to get past .
2007_05_15_1847586	38	We 're hoping we can maintain here for a while and start working on an upward path . ''
2007_05_15_1847586	39	When might they get to that path ? ''
2007_05_15_1847586	40	Some time this summer , '' said Piniella , who is in his fifth managing job . ''
2007_05_15_1847586	41	I 'd like to see us plateau for a while and win with a little consistency when the weather warms up . ''
2007_05_15_1847586	42	In Cincinnati , Seattle and Tampa Bay and with the Yankees , Piniella was a manager only .
2007_05_15_1847586	43	In Chicago , he has to be a meteorologist as well , dealing with the notorious wind at Wrigley Field . ''
2007_05_15_1847586	44	We have basically a fly-ball-hitting power team , '' he said , adding that the wind blowing in made it difficult to manufacture runs . ''
2007_05_15_1847586	45	We need the wind to start going the other way , '' he said . ''
2007_05_15_1847586	46	When that happens , I think you 'll see us get better . ''
2007_05_15_1847586	47	Piniella said the bullpen had to improve for the Cubs to win more games .
2007_05_15_1847586	48	Before the game , he lamented the relief pitchers ' performance -- their 2-9 record was the worst in the league .
2007_05_15_1847586	49	Right on cue , the bullpen lost another game .
2007_05_15_1847586	50	Rocky Cherry allowed two inherited runners to score in the sixth inning and tie the game , 4-4 , and Michael Wuertz walked in the decisive run with two out in the ninth . ''
2007_05_15_1847586	51	We thought that was going to be the strong point of our pitching staff , '' a disgusted Piniella said after the game . ''
2007_05_15_1847586	52	I have n't seen it .
2007_05_15_1847586	53	You keep hoping it comes around , but we 're getting into the middle of May now . ''
2007_05_15_1847586	54	In his frustration , Piniella , sounding just short of one of his infamous verbal tantrums that endeared him to his New York fans , suggested a solution . ''
2007_05_15_1847586	55	I 'm going to find out if there are some kids down in Triple A throwing the ball , '' he said . ''
2007_05_15_1847586	56	Maybe that 's the answer , get some different kids up here that can throw the ball .
2007_05_15_1847586	57	I do n't know what else to say .
2007_05_15_1847586	58	I 've tried everybody out there . ''

2007_05_15_1847595	10	He , more than any individual beyond Rod Thorn , the executive who traded for him , has been responsible for removing Exit 16W as a competitive blight on the N.B.A. map .
2007_05_15_1847595	11	But Kidd is 34 and the Nets are planning to redraw that map , and their future impact in Brooklyn invariably begins with decisions to come soon in New Jersey .
2007_05_15_1847595	12	So it 's possible that Kidd -- and Vince Carter -- have played their last home games as Nets . ''
2007_05_15_1847595	13	It 's the age-old question , how to head off getting old and hopefully bridging the gap , that all of us in the business have to deal with , '' Thorn , the team 's president , said . ''
2007_05_15_1847595	14	But as far as saying that we 've got to be good in 2009 or 2010 , whenever we do go to Brooklyn , I try to look at it as if we 're going to be in the same place . ''
2007_05_15_1847595	15	Business as usual , which in Thorn 's case has typically meant smart business , in the construction of a team that reached the N.B.A. finals in consecutive years and in the reconstruction of it after Kenyon Martin was wisely deemed unworthy of the $ 93 million he was blessed with by Denver .
2007_05_15_1847595	16	Understand that Thorn 's decision not to trade Kidd to the Lakers before the league 's trade deadline in February was far less an act of sentimentality or a commitment to stay the course with Kidd and Carter than it was a hunch that Thorn would be in a better bargaining position by the end of the season .
2007_05_15_1847595	17	Now , after another first-round playoff dismissal , Kobe is telling the Lakers ' management that the future had better be soon -- which means that their young center , Andrew Bynum , may be in play after all .
2007_05_15_1847595	18	Now , Dallas 's 67-victory season has gone up in smoke , and maybe the Mavericks ' owner , Mark Cuban , recognizes that Kidd or someone like him would never have allowed Nowitzki to drift aimlessly on the perimeter the way the Mavericks did in the playoff Waterloo with the Warriors .
2007_05_15_1847595	19	With every recorded playoff triple-double , every display of fundamental purity mixed with iron-willed intensity , Kidd has made himself more of a contender 's commodity , advanced age , sore knees and all .
2007_05_15_1847595	20	Kidd grabbed an eye-opening 17 rebounds last night and had 7 more assists , but the only Net who could shoot straight was the journeyman center Mikki Moore , who scored 25 points .
2007_05_15_1847595	21	Kidd , Carter and Richard Jefferson , the Nets ' big three , combined to shoot 11 of 48 from the field .
2007_05_15_1847595	22	Carter kept dribbling into late-game trouble , forever given that license here by Coach Lawrence Frank , and had the Nets ' last chance poked away by Eric Snow .
2007_05_15_1847595	23	If this was the last homestand of the Kidd era , better the ball should have been in his sure , creative hands at the finish because , as Thorn said : '' With the exception of his first year here , I 'd say he 's been as good this season as any .
2007_05_15_1847595	24	How much longer that goes on , well , there are some guys who are freaks of nature .
2007_05_15_1847595	25	I think he 's one of those guys . ''
2007_05_15_1847595	26	But is it worth it to the Nets to keep Kidd until nature takes its inevitable toll ?
2007_05_15_1847595	27	You could already make the case that Thorn missed an opportunity to steal Tony Parker when the San Antonio Spurs were romancing Kidd after defeating the Nets in the 2003 finals .
2007_05_15_1847595	28	Parker , nine years younger than Kidd , is one of the premier point guards starring in these playoffs .
2007_05_15_1847595	29	The Nets may already have Kidd 's successor in the rookie Marcus Williams , but it would be gut wrenching to trade the face of the franchise , its most important player since Julius Erving , and the favorite of the owner , Bruce C. Ratner .
2007_05_15_1847595	30	Thorn said , '' If there is a deal that 's good for our team , we 'll take a look at it .
2007_05_15_1847595	31	Thanks largely to his own ingenuity , Thorn has options but he also has issues .
2007_05_15_1847595	32	Carter , 30 , can opt out of his contract , but does Thorn want to marry him for five or six more years at premium salary ?
2007_05_15_1847595	33	Assuming the Nets are out again in the second round , does Thorn want to chase championship dreams for a suburban fan base that has n't exactly stormed the arena for Kidd and Company these past six years ?
2007_05_15_1847595	34	It has been a fun , freewheeling ride , but no one could blame Thorn or Ratner if they choose to focus this big-money losing Jersey lame duck on young players and the future , on a hot new market , arena and team that has a famous hip-hop star , Jay-Z , in its ownership group .
2007_05_15_1847595	35	In the here and now , it appears that the Cavaliers will be moving on .
2007_05_15_1847595	36	Down the road , given a Thorn track record that traces all the way back to drafting Michael Jordan in Chicago , who knows ?
2007_05_15_1847595	37	Maybe he lands another superstar for the Nets .
2007_05_15_1847595	38	Maybe he brings LeBron James to Brooklyn .

2007_05_15_1847596	0	Steve Nash has won two trophies , but they are the wrong kind for his team-first sensibility and his basketball legacy .
2007_05_15_1847596	1	On Monday night , Nash played with piercing eyes peering out from either side of his bandaged nose , furiously trying to bring his Phoenix Suns to back against the San Antonio Spurs in Game 4 of the Western Conference semifinals .
2007_05_15_1847596	2	When he twice assisted with behind-the-back passes on baskets by Amare Stoudemire that lifted the Suns to a 3-point lead with 32.5 seconds left , his emotions finally exploded in response to the last straw from the Spurs .
2007_05_15_1847596	3	It set up a wild finish and brought the rivalry to new heights when Phoenix won , 104-98 , to tie the series , 2-2 .
2007_05_15_1847596	4	On a rebound from a missed Spurs ' shot , Nash took the ball and dribbled up the right sideline .
2007_05_15_1847596	5	The Spurs ' veteran Robert Horry was there and stepped in his way .
2007_05_15_1847596	6	A forearm from Horry sent Nash into the scorers ' table with 18.2 seconds left and the Spurs leading , 100-97 .
2007_05_15_1847596	7	Nash sprung up and started to go after Horry , more angry than the usually restrained Nash normally becomes .
2007_05_15_1847596	8	From the bench , the Suns ' Boris Diaw started to go after the San Antonio players near half-court .
2007_05_15_1847596	9	Raja Bell was assessed a technical foul for starting toward Horry , and Stoudemire moved closer to the cluster of players and officials .
2007_05_15_1847596	10	The referee Steve Javie ejected Horry and then held Nash during the commotion and shouted to him , '' He 's gone now . ''
2007_05_15_1847596	11	Stoudemire started chanting , '' dirty , dirty , dirty '' to the Spurs crowd , echoing his claim after Game 2 . ''
2007_05_15_1847596	12	Was I lying when I said that ? ''
2007_05_15_1847596	13	he said , with a smile .
2007_05_15_1847596	14	Stoudemire could smile since Phoenix 's victory was assured .
2007_05_15_1847596	15	On Tuesday , Nash is expected to surrender the most valuable player mantle he held for the last two years to his best friend , Dallas ' Dirk Nowitzki .
2007_05_15_1847596	16	Nash does not want to join him out of the playoffs .
2007_05_15_1847596	17	He finished with 24 points and 15 assists , hitting 1 of 2 free throws following Horry 's foul .
2007_05_15_1847596	18	The game was over and the Spurs left the court stunned .
2007_05_15_1847596	19	The Spurs took an 80-72 lead into the final quarter .
2007_05_15_1847596	20	When Brent Barry hit a 3-pointer with 2 minutes 18 seconds to play in the third , he gave the Spurs their largest lead , 78-67 .
2007_05_15_1847596	21	From the supporting players to the Spurs ' vaunted trio , everyone seemed to be playing their roles to perfection .
2007_05_15_1847596	22	San Antonio 's momentum began gathering early in the second quarter when Stoudemire picked up his second foul after only 49 seconds had elapsed , and he remained on the bench for the rest of the half .
2007_05_15_1847596	23	The teams were tied at 24-24 when he left and the Spurs -- specifically Tony Parker -- started to play more aggressively .
2007_05_15_1847596	24	Parker picked apart the Suns ' interior defense , repeatedly driving the lane and drawing the defense before passing to Tim Duncan .
2007_05_15_1847596	25	While each began the game shooting 1 for 4 , Duncan and Parker did not pressure themselves to get into the flow .
2007_05_15_1847596	26	With the confidence from two championships won together in the last four seasons , the two soon found their rhythm .
2007_05_15_1847596	27	The Suns jumped out to an 8-point lead in the first quarter and played like they were fighting to remain in the series , let alone the game .
2007_05_15_1847596	28	One breathless sequence in the second quarter showed the kind of desperation from the Suns that their coach , Mike D'Antoni , said they needed .
2007_05_15_1847596	29	It came from Nash , of course .
2007_05_15_1847596	30	With four minutes left in the second quarter , Phoenix could not score despite keeping the possession alive with four offensive rebounds .
2007_05_15_1847596	31	The Spurs finally grabbed a miss and raced up the court .
2007_05_15_1847596	32	Nash sprinted back and got position in front of Duncan , drawing the charge .
2007_05_15_1847596	33	All night Nash would not back down , to Duncan or to Bruce Bowen .
2007_05_15_1847596	34	With just 50.9 seconds left in the second quarter , Nash was called for a foul for trying to shake Bowen as the two ran up the court .
2007_05_15_1847596	35	On Monday morning before Game 4 , the N.B.A. investigated Bowen 's foul in Game 3 when he kneed Nash in the groin area during Game 3 , which the Suns lost .
2007_05_15_1847596	36	Rather than suspend Bowen or fine him , however , the N.B.A. upgraded the foul to a flagrant-1 penalty .
2007_05_15_1847596	37	Bowen admitted that he kneed Nash , but he said he had apologized on the court . ''
2007_05_15_1847596	38	You have to be man enough at times and it 's not the right thing that you 've done , you have to be man enough for saying I 'm sorry about that , '' Bowen said . ''
2007_05_15_1847596	39	That 's all it was , in the spirit of competition .
2007_05_15_1847596	40	I let him know that was n't the case . ''
2007_05_15_1847596	41	Nash said several members of the Suns begged to differ .
2007_05_15_1847596	42	In response to the apology , Nash let Bowen know that he did not believe him .
2007_05_15_1847596	43	Bowen had been defending him closely all game , so in Nash 's view the knee to the groin was not out of character .
2007_05_15_1847596	44	It was Stoudemire who had called the Spurs dirty and singled out Bowen after the Suns ' victory in Game 2 , when Stoudemire felt Bowen deliberately kicked him in the heel .
2007_05_15_1847597	0	State voters will decide in November the future of the nation 's first statewide school voucher program , which would provide families with $ 500 to $ 3,000 per child for private school tuition .
2007_05_15_1847597	1	The Legislature narrowly adopted the program in February .
2007_05_15_1847597	2	Opponents , including teachers ' unions , the National PTA and the N.A.A.C.P. , said the program would harm public schools and gathered more than 124,000 signatures to force Utah 's first referendum since 1974 .
2007_05_15_1847597	3	Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr. , a Republican who initially recommended combining the referendum vote with the primary election on Feb. 5 to save money , signed an executive order last week setting the vote for Nov. 6 .
2007_05_15_1847597	4	The governor has asked legislators to provide money to help local governments pay for the election .
2007_05_15_1847598	0	Superintendents of four detention centers of the troubled Texas Youth Commission have been suspended with pay pending investigations .
2007_05_15_1847598	1	The suspensions , on charges of failing to report a sexual assault , inappropriate use of state resources , mistreatment and interfering with reporting or investigating incidents , involve centers in Edinburg , Harlingen , Crockett and Roanoke .
2007_05_15_1847598	2	The latest actions bring to 93 the number of agency employees disciplined since accusations of a cover-up of sexual abuse of juveniles by staff members and other inmates .
2007_05_15_1847598	3	Earlier , 8 employees were arrested and 81 were dismissed or are in process of termination .
2007_05_15_1847600	0	An article on Sunday about the decision by a powerful Shiite party , the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq , to drop the word '' revolution '' from its name omitted the party 's new name .
2007_05_15_1847600	1	It is the Iraqi Islamic Supreme Council .
2007_05_15_1847600	2	Correction : May 22 , 2007 , Tuesday An article on May 13 about the decision by a powerful Shiite party , the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq , to drop the word '' revolution '' from its name omitted the party 's new name , and a correction in this space on May 15 incorrectly rendered the English version of the new name .
2007_05_15_1847600	3	It is the Supreme Islamic Iraqi Council , not the Iraqi Islamic Supreme Council .
2007_05_15_1847611	0	A Jamaica clothing store employee who tried to stop two shoplifters was struck by their vehicle as they fled , the police said .
2007_05_15_1847611	1	The employee , whom the police identified only as a man in his 50s , saw a man and a woman take merchandise from the store , Pretty Girl , at 162-21 Jamaica Avenue about 1:20 p.m. and chased them .
2007_05_15_1847611	2	When the shoplifters got into a waiting minivan , the employee grabbed a door handle but was struck as the vehicle drove off , and received a head injury , the police said .
2007_05_15_1847611	3	He was taken to Mary Immaculate Hospital , where he was in critical condition .
2007_05_15_1847611	4	The police said late yesterday that no suspects had been arrested .
2007_05_15_1847612	0	The North Jersey Transportation Planning Authority yesterday approved a proposal by Gov. Jon S. Corzine to spend $ 1 billion in federal highway funds over 10 years on a new commuter rail tunnel under the Hudson River .
2007_05_15_1847612	1	The tunnel is expected to cost $ 7.5 billion to build , and officials have raised $ 3 billion of that , including the funds approved yesterday .
2007_05_15_1847612	2	Supporters say the tunnel will double rail capacity between New York City and New Jersey and will reduce highway congestion .
2007_05_15_1847612	3	New Jersey will also apply for funds from the Federal Transit Administration for the project .
2007_05_15_1847612	4	Construction of the two-track tunnel is expected to begin in 2009 and end in 2016 .
2007_05_15_1847612	5	To make up for the diverted federal highway funds , New Jersey will use $ 1 billion from its Transportation Trust Fund on state road work .
2007_05_15_1847613	0	A bill to increase penalties for gasoline price gouging unanimously passed the Assembly Transportation Committee yesterday .

2007_05_15_1847613	2	The previous fines were set nearly 70 years ago .
2007_05_15_1847613	3	The measure grew out of a rash of violations after Hurricane Katrina , which disrupted oil industry operations in the Gulf of Mexico , sent gasoline prices soaring in 2005 .
2007_05_15_1847613	4	The measure will now go to the full Assembly .
2007_05_15_1847614	0	A congressman from New Jersey said yesterday that he would propose a bill that would require all visitors to military installations to undergo federal background checks .
2007_05_15_1847614	1	The proposal comes in the wake of the charges filed last week against six men accused of planning an attack on soldiers at Fort Dix .

2007_05_15_1847614	3	The authorities have linked the six terrorist suspects to a pizzeria that frequently delivered to the base .
2007_03_15_1833018	0	MANY baby boomers who grew up wearing contact lenses thought they were liberated from glasses forever .
2007_03_15_1833018	1	But sometime between the 40th and 50th birthdays a cruel reality sets in .
2007_03_15_1833018	2	Suddenly the type in the newspaper is smaller .
2007_03_15_1833018	3	The controls on the car dashboard are blurry .
2007_03_15_1833018	4	Menus and price tags become illegible .
2007_03_15_1833018	5	Perish the thought , but they need glasses again -- only this time it 's the cheap plastic readers at the end of the pharmacy aisle .
2007_03_15_1833018	6	People who once brushed by the displays thinking '' those are for old people '' find themselves hijacking a pair to read the recommended dose on a bottle of antacid .
2007_03_15_1833018	7	Wearing and removing granny glasses throughout the day ( or having them permanently perched halfway down the nose ) , never seemed to bother their parents , but the generation born between 1946 and 1964 takes it as an affront to its youth oriented style .
2007_03_15_1833018	8	Barbara Reno , a vice president and managing director with the Conference Board in Brussels , could n't fit the glasses in the small handbags she favors , so never had them when needed .
2007_03_15_1833018	9	Idrienne Steiman-Weidberg , a Pilates teacher with her own studio in Indianapolis , hated the way she looked with the glasses dangling from her neck , but she could n't book appointments without them .
2007_03_15_1833018	10	Robert J. Reicher , a lawyer with his own practice in New York , misplaced his reading glasses so many times that he started buying them in bulk at Costco .
2007_03_15_1833018	11	But now there is a new development in contact lenses that makes it possible to see close , far and in between , without glasses .
2007_03_15_1833018	12	It is the latest option available to deal with presbyopia , the gradual deterioration of close vision , and more options are on the horizon .
2007_03_15_1833018	13	The contact lenses that correct distant , intermediate and near vision are called multifocal lenses , and though they have been around for about 10 years , they have been vastly improved recently .
2007_03_15_1833018	14	Computer technology has made it possible to fine-tune manufacturing .
2007_03_15_1833018	15	And optometrists and ophthalmologists have become more experienced with prescriptions and fittings , leading to less inconvenience and better results .
2007_03_15_1833018	16	When fitted correctly , multifocal lenses allow the wearer to see clearly at every distance without moving or even tilting the head , though vision may not be as crisp as with other alternatives .
2007_03_15_1833018	17	Most of the new lenses are aspheric , meaning they have three prescriptions arranged in concentric circles like a bull 's - eye -- typically with distance in the middle , intermediate vision next , and near vision in the outer circle .
2007_03_15_1833018	18	Multifocals come in soft lenses , which are known for their comfort , and in rigid gas permeable lenses , which produce sharper vision .
2007_03_15_1833018	19	Although some people require custom contact lenses to correct presbyopia , many others can choose from an assortment of off-the-shelf soft products , available in a two-week or 30-day disposable version .
2007_03_15_1833018	20	The price range for a one-year supply generally is $ 200 to $ 500 , depending on the type of lens and the degree of customization .
2007_03_15_1833018	21	A bigger expense may be the cost of fitting the lenses , which can vary depending on the complexity of a case and the number of visits .
2007_03_15_1833018	22	It can range from a modest insurance plan co-payment to about $ 1,000 .
2007_03_15_1833018	23	Most of the specialists in this field are optometrists .
2007_03_15_1833018	24	Often they stock samples from various manufacturers , enabling patients to try them in the office and then take them home for a test .
2007_03_15_1833018	25	( There 's typically a 90-day return or exchange policy . )
2007_03_15_1833018	26	Barry J. Farkas , an optometrist in New York who tests these products for the major manufacturers , said his success rate for presbyopic patients is 75 to 80 percent for gas permeable lenses , and 60 to 70 percent for soft lenses .
2007_03_15_1833018	27	( Less experienced prescribers may have slightly lower rates . )
2007_03_15_1833018	28	It takes a week or two to get used to the lenses , he said , and some people still need a supplemental pair of reading glasses for certain tasks , especially if the light is low .
2007_03_15_1833018	29	After Mr. Reicher , the lawyer , had been wearing multifocal lenses for two years , he started noticing that he needed more light to read .
2007_03_15_1833018	30	His doctor decreased his distance prescription so he would see better up close .
2007_03_15_1833018	31	That 's a typical trade-off with multifocal lenses , experts said , and Mr. Reicher decided he could live with it . ''
2007_03_15_1833018	32	The only time I notice it is with road signs or if I have a bad seat in the theater , '' he said .
2007_03_15_1833018	33	One alternative to multifocals is monovision , in which one eye ( usually the dominant one ) is fitted with a contact lens to see distance and the other is fitted with a lens to see close .
2007_03_15_1833018	34	An advantage of monovision is that if you can get used to it ( only about half the population can ) , you can have perfect distance vision and perfect near vision -- just not in both eyes , Dr. Farkas said .
2007_03_15_1833018	35	When Ms. Steiman-Weidberg , the Pilates teacher , first tried monovision , she felt so dizzy and disoriented that she abandoned the effort after a week and went back to wearing reading glasses over her contact lenses .
2007_03_15_1833018	36	But two years later , after her near vision worsened , she tried again .
2007_03_15_1833018	37	This time she easily adapted , but her tennis game suffered : as the ball came closer , her near vision kicked in and everything blurred .
2007_03_15_1833018	38	She now switches the lens she uses for reading to a distance lens when she is going to play tennis or watch a movie .
2007_03_15_1833018	39	It 's also possible to achieve monovision correction surgically , said Richard Braunstein , director of refractive surgery at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Medical Center .
2007_03_15_1833018	40	This works especially well with patients who have already used monovision in contacts .
2007_03_15_1833018	41	But the procedure may only be a temporary fix , Dr. Braunstein said .
2007_03_15_1833018	42	Because presbyopia continues to worsen for 15 to 20 years , people who have the surgery in their 40s will probably need reading glasses later on .
2007_03_15_1833018	43	Monovision in any form was n't an option for Peter Bermant because he has one eye that strongly dominates .
2007_03_15_1833018	44	He corrects his vision with another configuration , a bifocal lens , which is similar to bifocal eyeglasses , with distance vision corrected in the top half and near vision corrected in the lower part .
2007_03_15_1833018	45	Mr. Bermant said his gas permeable bifocal lenses give him the excellent near vision he needs for his work as an accountant with Anchin , Block & Anchin in New York .
2007_03_15_1833018	46	But getting the lens just right took some fine-tuning .
2007_03_15_1833018	47	As the lens shifted , Mr. Bermant did n't have the benefit of the reading portion on the bottom .
2007_03_15_1833018	48	His optometrist changed the shape slightly , to make the reading section thicker and prevent it from moving .
2007_03_15_1833018	49	But over all the success rate is 40 to 50 percent , Dr. Farkas estimated .
2007_03_15_1833018	50	Some people ca n't wear contact lenses .
2007_03_15_1833018	51	About 5 to 10 percent of the population has severe allergies or other medical conditions that make it impossible to tolerate the lenses , said Paul Super , an optometrist in Los Angeles .
2007_03_15_1833018	52	Dry eyes , a condition that becomes more prevalent as people age , can also be an impediment .
2007_03_15_1833018	53	For those who do n't succeed with contact lenses , and maybe even for those who do , new procedures and products that address presbyopia are being developed .
2007_03_15_1833018	54	Presbyopic laser correction is in clinical trials , Dr. Braunstein said .
2007_03_15_1833018	55	And lens implants , routinely used for people already undergoing cataract surgery , can provide correction both near and distant , freeing them from wearing glasses .
2007_03_15_1833018	56	The Food and Drug Administration has not yet approved implants for non-cataract use .
2007_03_15_1833018	57	The demand among baby boomers for sight correction '' is extraordinary , '' Dr. Braunstein said .
2007_03_15_1833018	58	And even more than vanity , it 's a matter of utility .
2007_03_15_1833018	59	People are living longer , working longer and leading more active lives , he said . ''
2007_03_15_1833018	60	They want to function as they age like they did when they were young . ''
2007_03_15_1833018	61	The Right Fit Can Be Elusive FINDING multifocal lenses that fit and correct distant , intermediate and near vision can require time and the willingness to persevere until your ophthalmologist or optometrist gets it right .
2007_03_15_1833018	62	My first experience with these lenses , prescribed by the ophthalmologist who had treated me for over 20 years , was a disaster .
2007_03_15_1833018	63	Urging me to '' give them a chance , '' he had the lenses delivered by mail rather than check the fit in his office .
2007_03_15_1833018	64	Reading was no problem , but my husband looked blurry across the dinner table .
2007_03_15_1833018	65	The lenses were sitting too high in my eye , so I was n't seeing through the distance part of the lens .
2007_03_15_1833018	66	Rather than wait for a do-over , I sought the advice of a high school classmate , H. Jay Wisnicki , chairman of ophthalmology at Beth Israel Medical Center in New York , and asked him to recommend someone with specific experience fitting contact lenses for presbyopia -- the condition that makes us all need reading glasses as we age .
2007_03_15_1833018	67	He referred me to Suzanne Bellante , an optometrist and contact lens expert on his staff .
2007_03_15_1833018	68	Dr. Bellante prescribed a custom-made gas permeable lens that would also correct my severe astigmatism .
2007_03_15_1833018	69	After a lifetime of myopia ( I got my first glasses at age 5 ) , these lenses made me feel like I had X-ray vision .
2007_03_15_1833018	70	I also could wear them for long hours working at the computer .
2007_03_15_1833018	71	But adjusting the near vision was a challenge , as Dr. Bellante had cautioned .
2007_03_15_1833018	72	It took two more iterations ( at no extra charge ) before I could comfortably read the newspaper without my glasses .
2007_03_15_1833018	73	The process covered four months , and eight visits to two eye specialists .
2007_03_15_1833018	74	But the day I picked up the lenses that I am now wearing , I experienced the same thrill I remember at 13 when I ditched my spectacles in favor of contact lenses for the first time .

2007_03_15_1833020	0	THE Madonna zip-front tracksuits sold at H&M last year may have disappointed some fans , for in all their polyester shininess , they did n't look like something She would wear .
2007_03_15_1833020	1	A cheerleading squad at a Florida retirement home , maybe , but not Her . ''
2007_03_15_1833020	2	I did n't read the reviews , '' Madonna said on the phone the other day . ''
2007_03_15_1833020	3	I do n't care what people say .
2007_03_15_1833020	4	I like them . ''
2007_03_15_1833020	5	Next week Madonna gets a do-over as a celebrity designer .
2007_03_15_1833020	6	Blouses , wrap dresses , printed halter tops , corset belts and a turban -- all designed by Madonna !
2007_03_15_1833020	7	-- go on sale in H&M 's 1,300 stores on March 22 .
2007_03_15_1833020	8	And , She wants you to know , real effort went into these clothes , like maybe She does care , just a little , about what people say . ''
2007_03_15_1833020	9	Did they come and see my show ? ''
2007_03_15_1833020	10	She asked , still on the subject of the mixed reviews . ''
2007_03_15_1833020	11	If they 'd seen my show , they would cut me some slack about how simple my tracksuit was .
2007_03_15_1833020	12	I like the simplicity of it and live in my tracksuits . ''
2007_03_15_1833020	13	But one can not live in tracksuits alone .
2007_03_15_1833020	14	The new collection , called M by Madonna , has an unexpected vibe that could be described as landed-gentry Madonna goes office-casual Madonna .
2007_03_15_1833020	15	The degree of workplace appropriateness depends on whether one chooses to accessorize with pearls or a riding crop .
2007_03_15_1833020	16	Madonna , who chooses both , was inspired by the dynamic young women who work with Her , a group She calls the Semtex Girls , because , you know , they are like the explosive .
2007_03_15_1833020	17	They are the kind of clothes that mean business and fun all at the same time , '' Madonna said . ''
2007_03_15_1833020	18	I thought about what I like to wear every day . ''
2007_03_15_1833020	19	Still , there will be Madonna fans ( um , me ) looking for something more emblematic of the many , many Hers .
2007_03_15_1833020	20	Like that bodysuit ( $ 19.90 ) that speaks of '' Confessions on a Dance Floor '' ; or the double-breasted pantsuit ( jacket , $ 99.90 ; pants , $ 59.90 ) , circa '' Express Yourself '' ; or a long white dress ( $ 69.90 ) that could have been a castoff from '' Vogue '' days .
2007_03_15_1833020	21	I did n't really think about anything in connection to the stages of my career or the evolution of my persona , '' She said .
2007_03_15_1833020	22	Not even the $ 34.90 corset belts ? ''
2007_03_15_1833020	23	Well , what part of my career did n't I have a corset in ? ''
2007_03_15_1833023	0	YOGA classes intimidate some men not only because they are usually outnumbered by women but also because not just any pair of pants will do .
2007_03_15_1833023	1	The best choices are fitted and flexible , to move with each stretch and knee bend , said our tester , Michael Burgasser , an owner of It 's Yoga , a studio in Cincinnati .
2007_03_15_1833023	2	Consider these mishaps : if legs are too wide , they will slip down during handstands , bunch behind the knees , or leave wearers overexposed ( gasp ! )
2007_03_15_1833023	3	when a leg is airborne during half-moon pose .
2007_03_15_1833023	4	To prevent those problems , most yoga pants are designed with slim legs and extra material in the crotch -- what 's known discreetly as an inseam gusset .
2007_03_15_1833023	5	Mr. Burgasser , who teaches Ashtanga , also recommends that pants material be soft enough to bend with you , but never slippery .
2007_03_15_1833023	6	Because many yoga studios offer only small changing stalls that often come with long waits , Mr. Burgasser prefers to find pairs of pants he feels comfortable wearing on the street .
2007_03_15_1833024	0	THE typical high E string on an electric guitar is a stainless steel filament 32 inches long and one-hundredth of an inch thick .
2007_03_15_1833024	1	It weighs perhaps as much as a few paper clips -- not a lot of raw material , but enough for the Barenaked Ladies to concern themselves with on their recent North American tour , which concluded last month .
2007_03_15_1833024	2	Working with a Maine-based environmental organization called Reverb , which also helps to '' green '' the tours of artists like Alanis Morissette , Sheryl Crow and the Red Hot Chili Peppers , Barenaked Ladies invited '' greening coordinators '' to gather up broken and used strings from the stage after gigs to be recycled by a New Hampshire company into jewelry .
2007_03_15_1833024	3	And that was hardly the only green gesture on the quirky Canadian rock quintet 's tour .
2007_03_15_1833024	4	The band ate locally grown organic food off plates and forks made of biodegradable potato starch .
2007_03_15_1833024	5	Its members drank from reusable canteens instead of plastic bottles .
2007_03_15_1833024	6	They traveled in a four-bus caravan fueled with biodiesel .
2007_03_15_1833024	7	And a portion of the proceeds from shows , along with donations , were used to purchase renewable energy credits to offset electricity consumed by the tour , down to the amps and spotlights .
2007_03_15_1833024	8	The band also played a slideshow on global warming as a sort of opening act before each gig , which was fine for the planet , the singer Steven Page conceded , but at times distracted the crowd from its primary mission -- namely , to rock . ''
2007_03_15_1833024	9	Sometimes , '' Mr. Page said , '' it could take a few songs to remind them that they 're there to have a good time . ''
2007_03_15_1833024	10	Like few other enterprises short of a military invasion , the rock tour is designed to convert copious amounts of material and energy into spectacle -- and produces equivalent amounts of waste .
2007_03_15_1833024	11	But in the '' Inconvenient Truth '' era , when even the oil and automobile industries are painting themselves green , it should come as little surprise that rock -- never shy about making grand , self-congratulatory gestures -- is working hard to catch up .
2007_03_15_1833024	12	Lately , it is doing so with the help of organizations like Reverb , a nonprofit group devoted primarily to the green rock tour .
2007_03_15_1833024	13	Bonnie Raitt , whose philanthropic foundation works with Reverb , said the goal is not only to make tours eco-friendly , but also to connect fans to the environmental movement . ''
2007_03_15_1833024	14	A change is coming , '' Ms. Raitt said in an e-mail message . ''
2007_03_15_1833024	15	Green power is the way out of this mess . ''
2007_03_15_1833024	16	In fact , momentum for greener rock tours has been building .
2007_03_15_1833024	17	Artists like Ms. Raitt , Dave Matthews and Willie Nelson have been vocal about their decision to travel in buses fueled by biodiesel , made of vegetable oils and producing less carbon dioxide .
2007_03_15_1833024	18	Bands like Coldplay have made news with plans to offset the energy consumed by their tours and CD manufacturing with tree-planting in third world countries .
2007_03_15_1833024	19	But the green rock tour as a concept is now moving on to a second act -- and that is where Reverb comes in .
2007_03_15_1833024	20	The organization , based in Portland , Me. , was founded in 2004 by Adam Gardner , a guitarist for the indie rock band Guster , and his wife , Lauren Sullivan , who worked for the Rainforest Action Network .
2007_03_15_1833024	21	Reverb charges acts a fee for its consulting services and is also sponsored by green companies and other fund-raisers .
2007_03_15_1833024	22	A prominent for-profit organization in the field is MusicMatters , a marketing company in Minneapolis .
2007_03_15_1833024	23	It works with environment-minded clients , produces events and consults with artists like the Dave Matthews Band and Jack Johnson on a wide range of green touring practices , down to the use of nonpetroleum-based cosmetics onstage . ''
2007_03_15_1833024	24	We like to consider ourselves an eco-SWAT team , '' said Mr. Gardner , 33 , explaining Reverb 's approach .
2007_03_15_1833024	25	Indeed , under its stern eye , promoters are shamed into ditching Styrofoam coffee cups from catering spreads backstage , and crew members are instructed to collect partially spent nine-volt batteries from musicians ' distortion boxes and wireless microphones . ''
2007_03_15_1833024	26	You go through 50 a week , but they 're only half-used , '' said Mr. Gardner , explaining that musicians who run a battery too far into its charge risk finding their guitars go silent .
2007_03_15_1833024	27	The batteries , high-mindedly , are saved for later use .
2007_03_15_1833024	28	Unfortunately , Mr. Gardner said , they have yet to determine how , so he and Ms. Sullivan , also 33 , have large boxes of them in their apartment . ''
2007_03_15_1833024	29	We 're trying to figure who to donate them to , '' he said .
2007_03_15_1833024	30	Even environmentalists have a hard time determining how much the greening efforts are feel-good public relations gestures and how much pay real ecological dividends .
2007_03_15_1833024	31	Regarding carbon-offset programs , for example , Ken Caldeira , a climate scientist at the Carnegie Institution , explained , '' In general , these offsets do some good , in the sense they usually help fund projects that are beneficial . ''
2007_03_15_1833024	32	But , he added , their benefits are hypothetical , intended to defer future emissions , while the actual tours produce significant amounts of greenhouse gases now . ''
2007_03_15_1833024	33	Half of that carbon dioxide will still be in the atmosphere for 100 years , '' he said , '' and none of these offsets will change that . ''
2007_03_15_1833024	34	Skeptics might also suggest that a greener-than-thou rock 'n' roll band is a highly relative concept .
2007_03_15_1833024	35	A true ecological troubadour would simply swear off the strobe lights and JumboTrons and stay home strumming acoustic guitar ditties for neighbors in the dark .
2007_03_15_1833024	36	The same goes for rock fans , even those responsible enough to carpool in their Subaru to the show : they will have to stare down the contradictions between planetary patriotism and the desire for a rocking good time -- at least until someone invents a biomass-fueled cigarette lighter to thrust aloft during encores .
2007_03_15_1833024	37	Craig Marks , the editor in chief of Blender magazine , observed that many of the green acts already have a base of liberal-leaning fans '' who are probably one step away from phoning into the PBS pledge drive for a free tote bag . '' ''
2007_03_15_1833024	38	They probably feel better knowing that the $ 300 they 're spending is somehow supporting something besides guitar solos and marijuana intake , '' Mr. Marks said .
2007_03_15_1833024	39	But while rock purists may debate how the fundamental environmentalist impulses toward sacrifice , deferred gratification and guilt fit within an art form built around abandon and excess , those working the front lines to build the greener rock tour believe their moment has arrived .
2007_03_15_1833024	40	Michael Martin , the president of MusicMatters , which has been working on the issue for years , said that as recently as the late '90s the concept of carbon offsets was generally unknown , and biodiesel was '' as hard to find as moonshine . ''
2007_03_15_1833024	41	So '' greening '' a tour meant making even smaller gestures , like inflating bus tires to specifications to achieve maximum fuel efficiency .
2007_03_15_1833024	42	But now , for example , Reverb-coordinated tours feature Eco-Villages -- interactive informational tents intended to teach fans about ecological issues .
2007_03_15_1833024	43	And , for most tours , Ms. Sullivan said , the organization deputizes volunteers to haul home bags of trash from backstage and sort out recyclables on their own time .
2007_03_15_1833024	44	( '' Hey , I went to a rock concert and came back with a bag of garbage -- great ! ''
2007_03_15_1833024	45	On most Reverb-advised tours , the performers funnel a percentage of ticket sales , or pay directly , to purchase renewable energy credits from a Vermont company called NativeEnergy -- enough for construction of wind , solar and biomass electricity generators to offset the amount of carbon produced by each tour .
2007_03_15_1833024	46	And to be sure , rock tours produce tremendous amounts of waste -- from 500 to 1,000 tons of carbon dioxide from a single stadium show , not including fan transportation .
2007_03_15_1833024	47	But perhaps the greatest challenge will be to spread the green message beyond those likely to turn up on the donor rolls of the Sierra Club -- say , to heavy metal bands , with their columns of fire spewing onstage , or hip-hop bands , for whom moneyed hyper-consumption is a theology as much as a song topic .
2007_03_15_1833024	48	Mr. Gardner , who is having a '' green '' guitar made for him by a Boston luthier from sustainably harvested wood , nontoxic stains and finishes and reclaimed hardware , admitted as much , recounting a conversation about alternative fuels with will.i.am from the Black Eyed Peas backstage at a Randalls Island show . ''
2007_03_15_1833024	49	He said , ` Huh , biodiesel , that 's cool , ' '' Mr. Gardner recalled . ''
2007_03_15_1833024	50	` Is that something I can run in my Hummer ? ' ''
2007_03_15_1833024	51	That was in 2005 .
2007_03_15_1833024	52	Will.i.am 's publicist said he is now driving a Tesla electric sports car .
2007_03_15_1833024	53	Correction : March 22 , 2007 , Thursday A picture caption last Thursday with an article about environmentally-conscious rock musicians misidentified a member of the rock group Guster .
2007_03_15_1833024	54	He is Ryan Miller -- not Adam Gardner , who helped established Reverb , an organization that consults with performers on greener rock tours .
2007_03_15_1833027	0	LIKE many men working in a creative field , Michael Famighetti is not a traditional tie guy . ''
2007_03_15_1833027	1	I find most of them too wide , or too silk , '' he said . ''
2007_03_15_1833027	2	Basically , too stuffy . ''
2007_03_15_1833027	3	Which is not to say that Mr. Famighetti , 28 , a photo editor at the Aperture Foundation , does not like wearing ties .
2007_03_15_1833027	4	He just prefers them loosened up a bit , a little offbeat , somewhere between a Ferragamo and a fish tie .
2007_03_15_1833027	5	It appears that a lot of stylish men are feeling similarly playful .
2007_03_15_1833027	6	Men 's shops , from Bergdorf Goodman to Bblessing on the Lower East Side , are stocked with neckties made from atypical fabrics or cut in novel ways .
2007_03_15_1833027	7	They are refreshingly , charmingly odd . ''
2007_03_15_1833027	8	It 's that tension between the traditional and the unusual that I find appealing , '' said Alexander Olch , a tie designer , whose round tortoiseshell glasses and halo of red mad-scientist hair mirror the skewed preppiness of his Italian corduroy and gingham seersucker ties .
2007_03_15_1833027	9	At Dior Homme , the designer Hedi Slimane has trimmed his already skinny ties to a three-quarter-inch strip that clips around the collar and hangs below the waist .
2007_03_15_1833027	10	At A.P.C. , scarflike cotton knits feel as light as a T-shirt and about as formal .
2007_03_15_1833027	11	And James Kendi , a Brooklyn tie designer whose dagger-shape bandanna and buffalo plaid ties are worn by Mr. Famighetti ( not to mention Justin Timberlake ) , sees his neckwear as part of a way of life -- a goofy albeit style-conscious one best portrayed in a video on his Web site ( kendities.com ) of a lanky guy in a striped tie dancing on a bed to Serge Gainsbourg 's '' Sea , Sex and Sun . ''
2007_03_15_1833027	12	But what about Mr. More Ordinary ?
2007_03_15_1833027	13	Can he wear a cheeky tie and not look clownish ?
2007_03_15_1833027	14	The answer is yes .
2007_03_15_1833027	15	But Matthew Edelstein , the fashion editor of Details magazine , cautions : '' It 's important to keep the rest of your styling subtle .
2007_03_15_1833027	16	Pairing an unusual tie with an equally statement-making look could make you appear as if you 'd recently escaped from the mental ward . ''
2007_03_15_1833029	0	The Friendship Wordsworth and Coleridge By Adam Sisman Illustrated .
2007_03_15_1833029	1	One summer day in 1797 , after walking 40 miles , young Samuel Taylor Coleridge bustled down a Dorset hillside and burst through a cornfield into the garden where William Wordsworth and his sister , Dorothy , were at work .
2007_03_15_1833029	2	The two - or three-day visit became three weeks of tramping the countryside , nightlong talk about a new world and the poetry that was to shape it , and long sessions of feverish writing at a common table .
2007_03_15_1833029	3	Lines and images were swapped back and forth , often literally , as one poet used the other 's notes or supplied a missing stanza .
2007_03_15_1833029	4	Finally , Coleridge had to return to his family in Somerset , but by that time a bond had formed that would develop into the most remarkable literary friendship and collaboration we know .
2007_03_15_1833029	5	The Wordsworths went so far as to raise stakes and follow their new friend , taking a house three miles from his .
2007_03_15_1833029	6	Daily intimacy between these founders of the British Romantic movement continued unbroken for 16 months , during which , Adam Sisman notes , '' each man would write some of his finest poetry . ''
2007_03_15_1833029	7	( It was renewed for a while , less intensely , when the two moved to the Lake District . )
2007_03_15_1833029	8	In '' The Friendship '' Mr. Sisman describes the exhilarating rise of a relationship the two poets referred to as '' the Concern , '' its full flowering and the seeds of destruction that lay within it .
2007_03_15_1833029	9	A glorious relationship was , by his telling , an infirm one as well .
2007_03_15_1833029	10	What was fruitfully complementary in two very different talents and temperaments ( Wordsworth 's , considered , purposeful and self-protective ; Coleridge 's , spontaneous and recklessly self-expending ) decayed very gradually into estrangement and bitter antagonism , quite against their will and to their sorrow .
2007_03_15_1833029	11	Mr. Sisman sets his story within an extensive panorama of the times .
2007_03_15_1833029	12	The middle classes , to which both men belonged , had long been on the rise economically but were only beginning to take hold politically .
2007_03_15_1833029	13	The French Revolution initially captured their enthusiasm , though the Terror and France 's aggressive military ventures , even before Napoleon , provoked alarm .
2007_03_15_1833029	14	Wordsworth was originally a strong supporter of the revolution , having spent nearly two years in France , though he gradually cooled .
2007_03_15_1833029	15	Coleridge 's interest in France was relatively minor , but he was a fiery advocate for radical reform at home .
2007_03_15_1833029	16	Their reputation for radicalism considerably outlived any active involvement .
2007_03_15_1833029	17	At one point , though , the home secretary dispatched an agent to Somerset to investigate reports that the two poets and their friends spoke in French-sounding accents , caroused and engaged in suspicious practices , among them '' washing and Mending their Cloaths all Sunday . ''
2007_03_15_1833029	18	There is rich detail here about the literary and publishing world .
2007_03_15_1833029	19	The pair were scorned by the critical establishment , still resolutely anti-Romantic , and by much of the public .
2007_03_15_1833029	20	Only contributions from a select circle of admirers saved them from destitution .
2007_03_15_1833029	21	Coleridge 's struggle was partly relieved by celebrity : not as a poet , but as a public speaker of passionate allure .
2007_03_15_1833029	22	William Hazlitt , who heard him preach , wrote that he '' launched into his subject , like an eagle dallying with the wind . ''
2007_03_15_1833029	23	By contrast with his sociable and often indolent friend , whose self-indulgence charmed others into feeling indulged , the austere and harder-working Wordsworth had no such success to compensate for his literary woes .
2007_03_15_1833029	24	For a number of years his main support was the love and artistic acuteness of his sister : '' She gave me eyes , she gave me ears . ''
2007_03_15_1833029	25	The price of poetic soaring , despite all that dragged him down , was a methodical discipline that edged into arrogance and intolerance of criticism .
2007_03_15_1833029	26	Hazlitt , who admired them both , drew a vivid contrast : '' Coleridge 's manner is more full , animated , and varied ; Wordsworth 's more equable , sustained , and internal .
2007_03_15_1833029	27	The one might be termed more dramatic , the other more lyrical .
2007_03_15_1833029	28	Coleridge has told me that he himself liked to compose in walking over uneven ground , or breaking through the straggling branches of a copse-wood ; whereas Wordsworth always wrote ( if he could ) walking up and down a straight gravel walk , or in some spot where the continuity of his verse met with no collateral interruption . ''
2007_03_15_1833029	29	( Uninterrupted discursiveness marks Wordsworth 's weaker stuff . )
2007_03_15_1833029	30	Part of their gradual falling-out stemmed from Wordsworth 's disciplined stability and the growing damage inflicted by the growing instability and wildness of the opium-addicted Coleridge .
2007_03_15_1833029	31	A hellish marriage -- largely the result of a fecklessness that approached heartlessness , and of an obsessive love for Wordsworth 's sister-in-law -- made things worse .
2007_03_15_1833029	32	The root of the split , though , lay in the nature of the two men 's attachment .
2007_03_15_1833029	33	Coleridge , who intimately doubted not his poetic genius but whether he could sustain it , invariably hailed Wordsworth as his master .
2007_03_15_1833029	34	Wordsworth , who required the admiration , agreed .
2007_03_15_1833029	35	So much so that when they collaborated in '' Lyrical Ballads , '' he insisted on appearing as the sole name on the title page and retained sole copyright , even though five poems , including '' The Rime of the Ancient Mariner , '' were Coleridge 's .
2007_03_15_1833029	36	Coleridge apparently agreed ; but , according to Mr. Sisman , this and other matters ( Wordsworth 's refusal to include '' Christabel '' ) shattered him .
2007_03_15_1833029	37	Ill and humiliated , he wrote to William Godwin that '' by shewing to him what true Poetry was , '' Wordsworth '' made him know , that he himself was no Poet . ''
2007_03_15_1833029	38	The account of the last years is desolate .
2007_03_15_1833029	39	The two met occasionally in company but barely spoke ( though there was a brief , chilly European tour with Wordsworth 's daughter ) .
2007_03_15_1833029	40	If the self-dramatizing Coleridge inevitably emerges more vividly , he also emerges as an intolerable burden .
2007_03_15_1833029	41	Mr. Sisman manages neutrality , and it is the neutrality of tragedy .
2007_03_15_1833030	0	Q. How high should my sofa be , relative to the other seating in the room ?
2007_03_15_1833030	1	A rule of thumb is that seating should be between 15 and 18 inches off the ground .
2007_03_15_1833030	2	Any higher and a seat will feel too throne-like ; any lower and you will feel like you are sitting on the floor .
2007_03_15_1833030	3	You might think that in a room with several seating arrangements , there would be some flexibility in seat heights .
2007_03_15_1833030	4	Not so , according to Jeffrey Bilhuber , the designer responsible for the interior at the 70 Park Avenue Hotel in New York , as well as the homes of Mariska Hargitay and David Bowie .
2007_03_15_1833030	5	Excessive variation in seat heights makes it hard for people to talk to each other , Mr. Bilhuber said , which is a problem , especially when you are entertaining . ''
2007_03_15_1833030	6	Three inches is the maximum seat-height disparity you can have without ruining the party , '' he said .
2007_03_15_1833030	7	But do n't try to get around the problem by buying matching seating , which will erase a room 's character . ''
2007_03_15_1833030	8	Please do not buy a matching furniture ` suite ' with no personality from a big-box store in order to get corresponding seat heights , '' Mr. Bilhuber said .
2007_03_15_1833030	9	If you want to buy all your furniture from one company , he said , '' make sure you get pieces that are similar in seat height , but also present different textures and color tones . ''
2007_03_15_1833030	10	In his own living room , Mr. Bilhuber has a 10-foot sofa , a 19th-century settee and a set of 10 antique chairs , all within a comfortable range of heights .
2007_03_15_1833030	11	His previous living room , above , had three very different seating pieces with similar heights .
2007_03_15_1833030	12	To create a mix of styles with similar seat heights , you can look for a company that carries many different brands and lists seat heights at its Web site .
2007_03_15_1833030	13	One such site is Design Within Reach ( dwr.com ) .
2007_03_15_1833030	14	For a medium - to large-size living room , you could start with a basic Portola Sofa ( $ 1,998 to $ 4,298 , depending on length and fabric ) and a matching armchair ( $ 1,398 to $ 1,898 ) in a different color .
2007_03_15_1833030	15	In an adjacent seating area , you could add a loveseat like the mod-looking ( and modular ) Libre Two Seater ( $ 1,198 to $ 1,298 in fabric ; $ 1,998 in leather ) .
2007_03_15_1833030	16	For visual interest , you might throw in a chair or two like Philippe Starck 's aluminum Heritage Rocker from Emeco ( $ 640 ) or the Ultra Bellini Chair ( $ 195 ) , made of injection-molded nylon with a flexible back .
2007_03_15_1833030	17	The room will look stylishly mismatched , but all the seat heights will be the same : 18 inches .
2007_03_15_1833030	18	You can do a seat-height check just as easily at Ikea 's Web site ( ikea.com ) .
2007_03_15_1833030	19	You might like the way a traditional-looking beige Ektorp chair ( $ 349 ) contrasts with a black leather Sandhem sofa ( $ 999 ) ; both have a 17 3/4 - inch seat height .
2007_03_15_1833030	20	Besides evaluating the seating , you should consider the other furniture in the room .
2007_03_15_1833030	21	David Ling , a New York-based architect who does residential and retail interiors , recommends choosing '' a big , substantial grounding piece to tie all the seating together , '' like a coffee table .
2007_03_15_1833030	22	For one client , Mr. Ling picked a Kjaerholm sofa and chair in black leather ; between them , he placed a raw-edged wood table by George Nakashima .
2007_03_15_1833030	23	The Stick coffee table from Lorna Lee John Muller Designs ( around $ 9,000 ) , a collection of wooden sticks fused into a single blocky whole , would be another high-impact choice .
2007_03_15_1833030	24	It is so impressive , it almost compensates for having one uncomfortably high piece of furniture .
2007_03_15_1833030	25	Finally , if you love a chair or a sofa but the legs are too high , Mr. Bilhuber said , there is an extreme solution : hire a professional with a hacksaw and have the legs cut down .
2007_03_15_1833030	26	But check with an appraiser first , especially if the piece is an antique , to make sure you are not chopping off its value .
2007_03_15_1833032	0	I 'VE always thought of worms as my friends , until I started talking to ecologists who have been studying their voracious appetite for leaves . ''
2007_03_15_1833032	1	Your grandmother was wrong all these years , '' said Dennis Burton , an ecologist at the Schuylkill Center for Environmental Education in Philadelphia .
2007_03_15_1833032	2	Worms may be good for vegetables and flowers , but for trees and shade plants they are a large and growing menace .
2007_03_15_1833032	3	In an agricultural field or a vegetable garden , worms help decompose organic matter , churning nutrients back into the soil .
2007_03_15_1833032	4	Their constant tunneling aerates the soil , creating pathways for air , water and plant roots .
2007_03_15_1833032	5	But in forests in the Northeast and parts of the Midwest , worms are proliferating and consuming leaves at such a pace that they are actually destroying the duff , the thick leaf litter that nourishes tree seedlings , prevents erosion and protects woodland plants from disease and insects .
2007_03_15_1833032	6	They are wreaking havoc in woodland gardens , too .
2007_03_15_1833032	7	Barbara and Robert Tiffany , who tend four acres of shade-loving plants at their home , MillFleurs , in Point Pleasant , Pa. , have watched their prize-winning , four-foot-wide hostas shrink to half their size .
2007_03_15_1833032	8	The Tiffanys first noticed that their hostas were shrinking two years ago .
2007_03_15_1833032	9	This was a crisis : they had promised to show off their 1,100 hosta cultivars to the American Hosta Society at its national convention last June in Philadelphia . ''
2007_03_15_1833032	10	I had no idea what was happening , '' Ms. Tiffany said .
2007_03_15_1833032	11	They thought their water might be the problem , so they had it tested .
2007_03_15_1833032	12	But the water was fine .
2007_03_15_1833032	13	Then they noticed '' gazillions of worms , '' Ms. Tiffany said . ''
2007_03_15_1833032	14	Every time I would stick a trowel into the soil , worms would pop up or skitter away .
2007_03_15_1833032	15	They were so energized , not like the worms of my childhood . ''
2007_03_15_1833032	16	Mr. Tiffany did a little research and learned that the Northeast and the Great Lakes region were plagued by worms .
2007_03_15_1833032	17	They sent a few of their worms to Cindy Hale , a scientist at the University of Minnesota , who identified them as Amynthas hawayanus and Lumbricus terrestris , two species that are invading the Northeast .
2007_03_15_1833032	18	The Tiffanys realized , in retrospect , that they had been helping the worms proliferate by carting in mulch for paths and top-dressing plants with compost .
2007_03_15_1833032	19	They recalled digging up one prized hosta , a four-footer that had been reduced to two feet , and counting 19 worms as they fell from its roots .
2007_03_15_1833032	20	The roots , normally so fleshy and vigorous , were stunted and sort of shredded , '' as if something had eaten them , '' Ms. Tiffany said . ''
2007_03_15_1833032	21	Earthworms were not meant to be in a forest , '' said Anne Bower , a conservation biologist at Philadelphia University who explained that northern forests evolved without worms . ''
2007_03_15_1833032	22	Their decomposers are fungi , microflora and fauna , which release nutrients very slowly , '' she said .
2007_03_15_1833032	23	Worms arrived with the Colonists , who came in ships often weighted with rocks and soil , for ballast .
2007_03_15_1833032	24	The settlers brought plants , too , which carried worms and their eggs in plant roots .
2007_03_15_1833032	25	Over the centuries , of course , imported plants added to the exotic worm population ; so did the fishermen who tossed their bait worms along the banks of streams and lakes .
2007_03_15_1833032	26	In fact , the night crawler , Lumbricus terrestris , native to Europe and a favorite for baiting fish , is a big eater in the forest . ''
2007_03_15_1833032	27	It 's an anecic species , a deep diver , '' Mr. Burton said . ''
2007_03_15_1833032	28	It burrows deep into the soil , pulling leaf litter with it . ''
2007_03_15_1833032	29	Another invasive worm , an Asian species , Amynthas hawayanus , is epigeic , meaning it stays close to the earth 's surface , living in the topsoil and the duff layer . ''
2007_03_15_1833032	30	It 's like a rototiller running around the surface of the forest , '' Mr. Burton said .
2007_03_15_1833032	31	Both these worms , among others , have higher populations in urban and suburban areas than in rural areas .
2007_03_15_1833032	32	This makes sense , because they first came in through seaports and are often spread by gardeners who not only purchase their plants but also trundle mulch and compost into their woodland gardens .
2007_03_15_1833032	33	The Asian genus , Amynthas , was first noted in New York and Connecticut in the late 1980s by ecologists working for the Institute of Ecosystem Studies in Millbrook , N.Y. .
2007_03_15_1833032	34	They were trying to analyze the health of forests in a 100-mile radius of New York City .
2007_03_15_1833032	35	These worms change the very chemistry of the soil , because their gizzards emit calcium carbonate , which acts like lime on acid soil , making it more alkaline .
2007_03_15_1833032	36	That may be nice for corn and sunflowers , but it is not good for azaleas and oaks , which thrive in acid soil .
2007_03_15_1833032	37	The worms are also breaking down organic matter so quickly that the nutrient overload is injuring plants and running off into streams and lakes .
2007_03_15_1833032	38	Invasive plant species , like stiltgrass and garlic mustard , which thrive on heavy nitrogen , then move in .
2007_03_15_1833032	39	How do you find out if you have too many worms ?
2007_03_15_1833032	40	Look for signs of invasive worms , such as a thinning forest floor or even eroded open spaces .
2007_03_15_1833032	41	Another sign is a noticeable lack of spring ephemerals like trillium , mayflowers and trout lilies , which are disturbed by all these tiny plows shifting the microbial community from fungal to bacterial .
2007_03_15_1833032	42	To test for worms , mark off a section of your woodland garden or forest about three feet square .
2007_03_15_1833032	43	Then wait for a heavy rain ( this test will not work in dry soil ) .
2007_03_15_1833032	44	If the soil is moist , apply a hot Chinese mustard solution , made by mixing two cups Chinese mustard with 10 1/2 quarts of water .
2007_03_15_1833032	45	Sink five coffee cans , tops and bottoms removed , about an inch into the ground of the marked area , then pour the mustard solution into the cans . ''
2007_03_15_1833032	46	The mustard solution will go straight down and the worms will come up , '' Ms. Bower said .
2007_03_15_1833032	47	If more than five worms pop out , you have a problem .
2007_03_15_1833032	48	In rural areas Ms. Bower 's researchers have found only about two worms per three square feet ; '' in the city we 're getting 89 , '' she said .
2007_03_15_1833032	49	Ms. Bower and Mr. Burton have been testing various organic controls , like tobacco , walnut shells and pine needles .
2007_03_15_1833032	50	They were not effective .
2007_03_15_1833032	51	Sulfur pellets , however , mixed with oak leaf mulch , which is acidic , showed promise .
2007_03_15_1833032	52	Simply follow the directions on the back of the sulfur bag , and do not apply more than is recommended .
2007_03_15_1833032	53	( Soil that is too acidic will have its own problems . )
2007_03_15_1833032	54	Then spread out a couple of inches of the oak leaf mulch .
2007_03_15_1833032	55	The Department of Agriculture lists earthworms as beneficial organisms , so using a pesticide to kill them is technically illegal .
2007_03_15_1833032	56	To avoid having so many worms in the first place , be sure not to feed them by spreading wood chips or compost in paths in the forest .
2007_03_15_1833032	57	Do not toss grass clippings , another favorite worm food , next to the woods , either .
2007_03_15_1833032	58	And do not toss out fishing worms or red wrigglers by throwing them on the ground or in a pond ( they do not drown ) .
2007_03_15_1833032	59	If worms are destroying your woodland plants and you have no choice but to kill them , they can be put in alcohol , frozen or collected in a bag and sent to the landfill .

2007_03_15_1833034	2	It is now sending up another bloom stalk .
2007_03_15_1833034	3	How can I help this year 's flowers open ?
2007_03_15_1833034	4	A. Congratulations on having an aloe sufficiently large and mature to flower .
2007_03_15_1833034	5	Aloes seldom get that far indoors unless grown in greenhouses . ''
2007_03_15_1833034	6	How close to the window is it ? ''
2007_03_15_1833034	7	asked Gary Lyons ( license plate : ALOES ) , curator of the Huntington Desert Garden in San Marino , Calif. , which has close to 300 aloe species .
2007_03_15_1833034	8	Most bloom in January and February , in a red , orange , yellow and pink display worth traveling to see .
2007_03_15_1833034	9	They do like a lot of light , Mr. Lyons said .
2007_03_15_1833034	10	Try moving yours closer to the glass or to a sunnier exposure .
2007_03_15_1833034	11	If it has been in the same pot for many years , it probably needs new soil , he said .
2007_03_15_1833034	12	Give it some high-bloom fertilizer , he added , and if you have been withholding water , give it an occasional drink .
2007_03_15_1833034	13	Aloes are from the Southern Hemisphere , and most still act as if our winter is their summer growing season , he explained .
2007_03_15_1833034	14	Pushing them hard in low light is unwise , but do not be afraid to respond if they appear hungry or thirsty .
2007_03_15_1833034	15	Given that you are near success with yellow-flowered A. vera , can a lust for more unusual varieties be far behind ?
2007_03_15_1833034	16	Dozens of choices are sold by specialists including Bob Smoley 's Gardenworld , (352) 465-8254 or bobsmoleys.com , and Arid Lands Greenhouses , (520) 883-9404 or aridlands.com .
2007_03_15_1833034	17	What Knotweed Does Not Need Q. Japanese knotweed has taken over the woods next door and is creeping into our lawn .
2007_03_15_1833034	18	Last spring we ground its roots with a rotary tiller , to no avail .
2007_03_15_1833034	19	What would you advise ?
2007_03_15_1833034	20	A. I 'd advise moving , but failing that at least please put away the tiller .
2007_03_15_1833034	21	Japanese knotweed ( Polygonum cuspidatum ) can sprout from almost any piece of root , so the more of these you create , the worse the problem will be .
2007_03_15_1833034	22	The lawn is your best defense , because routine mowing keeps knotweed at bay .
2007_03_15_1833034	23	The adjacent hordes will continue to send scouts under the lawn , but as long as you keep cutting them off , you can hold back forward movement .

2007_03_15_1833039	0	The kitchen and bathroom are obvious places for glass tile , but Piero Bisazza , the chief executive officer of Bisazza , the Vicenza , Italy-based tile company , does n't see any reason to stop there .
2007_03_15_1833039	1	Mr. Bisazza , who describes himself as an '' anti-minimalist , '' envisions it throughout the house , even in the living room .

2007_03_15_1833041	0	The subjects of this month 's new books range from the collective consciousness of a Chicago advertising agency to the imagined life of a young woman living in an impoverished Latin American country .
2007_03_15_1833041	1	There is also a posthumously published novel that has at its heart an enormous catfish : '' She was the nightmare fish of small boys , and she came from the depths of sweaty dreams to suck them and their feeble cane poles from the bank or the boat dock to a soggy grave . ''
2007_03_15_1833041	2	Acceptance By Susan Coll 286 pages .
2007_03_15_1833041	3	Admissions-nightmare novels have become a genre in recent years ( '' apps lit , '' as Washington Monthly calls it ) .
2007_03_15_1833041	4	Susan Coll 's new novel , her third , chronicles a year in the life of three college-bound students at a suburban high school in Maryland : a driven boy with the nickname of AP Harry , and his neighbors Taylor Rockefeller ( not of those Rockefellers ) and Maya Kaluantharana , as they strive to get into the colleges of their choice , including the fictional Yates University .
2007_03_15_1833041	5	Parents who already know the definition of a '' collect call '' ( a perfect 800 on the SAT ) may -- or may not -- recognize themselves in the book 's cast of characters , ranging from Harry 's befuddled mother , Grace , to pushy Nina Rockefeller and the high-achieving Kaluantharanas , whose idea of a safety school is the University of Chicago .
2007_03_15_1833041	6	A Miracle of Catfish By Larry Brown 455 pages .
2007_03_15_1833041	7	Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill .
2007_03_15_1833041	8	Larry Brown had just sent a draft of this , his sixth novel , to his literary agent when he died of a heart attack in November 2004 .
2007_03_15_1833041	9	The 710-page manuscript has been published as '' a novel in progress , '' with cuts but no revisions by his editor , Shannon Ravenel .
2007_03_15_1833041	10	Mr. Brown , a former firefighter turned novelist from Oxford , Miss. , was known for his hardscrabble portraits of working-class Southerners , and this book mines the same territory .
2007_03_15_1833041	11	The characters include Cortez Sharp , who dreams of building a catfish pond , and his daughter and that catfish , Ursula , which was '' a maw-jawed mamaw , '' Mr. Brown writes . ''
2007_03_15_1833041	12	Endlessly turning in her tank like a soul sentenced to purgatory forever . ''
2007_03_15_1833041	13	Then We Came to the End By Joshua Ferris 387 pages .
2007_03_15_1833041	14	Little , Brown & Company .
2007_03_15_1833041	15	Joshua Ferris 's novel begins '' early in the time of balanced budgets and the remarkable rise of the Nasdaq '' at a Chicago advertising agency .
2007_03_15_1833041	16	It 's a stunt -- told mostly in the first-person plural .
2007_03_15_1833041	17	( '' We had a toy client , a car client , a long-distance carrier and a pet store .
2007_03_15_1833041	18	We did TV , print , direct mail and Internet .
2007_03_15_1833041	19	We had a business-to-business division .
2007_03_15_1833041	20	We drank too much on the weekends .
2007_03_15_1833041	21	We had the great good fortune and shortcomings of character that marked every generation that had never seen war . '' )
2007_03_15_1833041	22	As things at the agency start to go sour -- Lynn Mason , a partner , has breast cancer ; layoffs begin ( the group calls them '' walking Spanish down the hall '' ) -- the complicated and tattered personal lives of the collective are teased out .
2007_03_15_1833041	23	If the revelation at the book 's end feels unearned , Mr. Ferris can be both emotionally resonant and quite funny .
2007_03_15_1833041	24	The Beautiful Things That Heaven Bears By Dinaw Mengestu 228 pages .
2007_03_15_1833041	25	It 's hard sometimes to remember why we do anything in the first place , '' one of the characters in Dinaw Mengestu 's first novel says . ''
2007_03_15_1833041	26	It 's nice to think there 's a purpose , or even a real decision that turns everything in one direction , but that 's not always true , is it ?
2007_03_15_1833041	27	We just fall into our lives . ''
2007_03_15_1833041	28	That is what has happened to the book 's main character , Sepha Stephanos , an Ethiopian immigrant and the owner of a failing grocery store in a gentrifying corner of Washington .
2007_03_15_1833041	29	When Judith , a white woman , and her biracial daughter , Naomi , buy the grand house next door to his market , his world seems poised to change .
2007_03_15_1833041	30	The book 's title is taken from a line in Dante 's '' Inferno '' when the poet emerges from Hell : '' Through a round aperture I saw appear , / Some of the beautiful things that Heaven bears . ''
2007_03_15_1833041	31	You Do n't Love Me Yet By Jonathan Lethem 224 pages .
2007_03_15_1833041	32	Jonathan Lethem 's latest novel is set in the Los Angeles of storefront galleries and struggling rock bands , where characters live in Silver Lake apartments , not Malibu beach houses .
2007_03_15_1833041	33	At the start , Lucinda Hoekke , the bassist in a band with no name , quits her day job at a coffee shop to take part in a conceptual art project , answering phones at the Complaint Center ( '' a fake office that needs fake office workers to answer real telephone calls , '' as she explains it ) .
2007_03_15_1833041	34	One caller captures her with his stories , which soon become fodder for the band 's songs , and then spill into Lucinda 's life when she and the complainer meet .
2007_03_15_1833041	35	At one point , the band is booked to play an event called the Aparty ( '' like apart , y '' ) , where guests are supposed to come equipped with headphones and their own dance music , but things get out of hand . ''
2007_03_15_1833041	36	Falmouth had tried to appropriate other people 's happiness , '' Lucinda thinks , '' and been met with that property 's devastatingly blithe resistance .
2007_03_15_1833041	37	Happiness was disobedient , had its own law .
2007_03_15_1833041	38	As a freshly minted local expert , Lucinda felt qualified to know . ''
2007_03_15_1833041	39	A Far Country By Daniel Mason 288 pages .
2007_03_15_1833041	40	Daniel Mason 's first novel , '' The Piano Tuner , '' was set in Burma in the 1880s .
2007_03_15_1833041	41	His new book , '' A Far Country , '' takes place in an unnamed time and a place that seems a lot like contemporary Latin America .
2007_03_15_1833041	42	Isabel , a 14-year-old , journeys from her home in the drought-stricken '' backlands '' of her country to a teeming shantytown called New Eden on the edge of a sprawling city .
2007_03_15_1833041	43	She is in search of her older brother , Isaias , who has disappeared .
2007_03_15_1833041	44	At one point , Isabel wakes in the night thinking about him : '' So this is what absence means .
2007_03_15_1833041	45	I never thought it was something that came so quietly .
2007_03_15_1833041	46	That you only really notice it later , when you go to look for someone and he is n't there . ''
2007_03_15_1833043	0	Conan O'Brien 's loyalty to Andy Richter is impressive .
2007_03_15_1833043	1	Mr. Richter played sidekick to Mr. O'Brien on NBC 's '' Late Night '' from 1993 to 2000 , beginning when Mr. O'Brien was nothing but a cub .
2007_03_15_1833043	2	But the awkward fact is that Mr. Richter did n't stay for the duration , Ed McMahon-style , Tonto-style .
2007_03_15_1833043	3	In his sweet and beta way , Andy Richter deserted .
2007_03_15_1833043	4	He went to peddle his lovability elsewhere : in supporting roles , as in '' Talladega Nights , '' and front and center , as in '' Andy Richter Controls the Universe . ''
2007_03_15_1833043	5	It seems he wanted to be in the big chair himself , and from afar Mr. O'Brien 's fondness never wavered .
2007_03_15_1833043	6	Like Don Knotts , Mr. Richter is one of those rare performers whom other comics like to share a stage with , help out and forgive for almost anything .
2007_03_15_1833043	7	But audiences are different from performers : they have a martial idea of rank .
2007_03_15_1833043	8	You do n't go from sidekick to frontman easily .
2007_03_15_1833043	9	Mr. Richter is soft , friendly , affable .
2007_03_15_1833043	10	He 's supposed to listen and laugh as much as he talks and jokes .
2007_03_15_1833043	11	Still , Mr. O'Brien and Jonathan Groff , a onetime head writer for '' Late Night , '' are positive that their honey deserves another shot in a title role .
2007_03_15_1833043	12	And they 're correct to take the chance .
2007_03_15_1833043	13	Some shows , the ones short on snickers and put-downs ( those are for Jimmy Kimmel ) , actually require a good-natured , rosily complexioned and hefty lead .
2007_03_15_1833043	14	Witness Kevin James on '' The King of Queens . ''
2007_03_15_1833043	15	Tonight Mr. Richter opens in '' Andy Barker , P.I. , '' a heavily plotted crime show that 's meant to evoke the 1970s -- not just with its hat tips to TV of the period , but with its cocktail-culture drollery .
2007_03_15_1833043	16	Mr. Richter plays Andy Barker , an accountant in a Los Angeles exurb , who appears at first to be living a hollow existence in which high pleasure is afforded by '' Judging Amy '' on TiVo .
2007_03_15_1833043	17	On greater exposure the Barker life looks like fun .
2007_03_15_1833043	18	Andy 's office , in a big-box mall called Fair Oaks Plaza , is spacious and icy-clean in the way of early - '90s stylized set design ( think Hal Hartley ) .
2007_03_15_1833043	19	The plaza also allows for sociability with the downstairs neighbor , Simon ( Tony Hale ) , a jivey video store owner whose obsolete livelihood means that he has time on his hands .
2007_03_15_1833043	20	Together they get drawn into a classic noir plot in tonight 's episode , and Andy turns out to have a knack for solving crimes .
2007_03_15_1833043	21	Further supported by a codger detective , Lew Staziak ( the movie veteran Harve Presnell ) , and a patriotic restaurateur , Wally ( Marshall Manesh ) , Andy hangs a private-eye shingle , and a franchise is born .
2007_03_15_1833043	22	The second episode introduces a new crime , including the mystery of an obese man 's sex appeal .
2007_03_15_1833043	23	Part of what 's satisfying about '' Andy Barker '' is that it answers a truly urgent historical question : What would Jake Gittes , Philip Marlowe or Sam Spade have done with Google ?
2007_03_15_1833043	24	Often Andy turns to the old Internet when he wants to find a fact or a fugitive , and the camera is not shy with its shots of the computer screen .
2007_03_15_1833043	25	The show is surprisingly beautiful -- if you came across it while flipping channels , you 'd think it was a movie -- and that adds to its platinum-card sheen .
2007_03_15_1833043	26	NBC has lately become a network for the rich , which would be nauseating except that sometimes '' upscale '' also means '' good . ''
2007_03_15_1833043	27	This peculiar series seals NBC 's new role as the skinflint 's HBO .
2007_03_15_1833043	28	The shows '' 30 Rock , '' '' Friday Night Lights '' and now '' Andy Barker , P.I. '' are all so engrossing and so creatively untrammeled that it 's almost suspicious .
2007_03_15_1833043	29	Have the rules of network TV changed ?
2007_03_15_1833043	30	Does no one need to make money anymore ?
2007_03_15_1833043	31	We may be in a golden age .
2007_03_15_1833043	32	Watch these shows while you still can , meaning now .
2007_03_15_1833043	33	This not being the 1970s , all six episodes of '' Andy Barker , P.I. '' are already available , all the time , on nbc.com .
2007_03_15_1833043	34	Andy Barker , P.I. NBC , tonight at 9:30 , Eastern and Pacific times ; 8:30 , Central time .
2007_03_15_1833043	35	Created by Conan O'Brien and Jonathan Groff , series executive producers with Jeff Ross and David Kissinger ; Jason Ensler , director ; Peter Schindler and Chuck Tatham , co-executive producers ; Andy Richter , producer ; Josh Bycel , Jane Espenson , Alex Herschlag , Gail Lerner , Gregg Mettler and Jon Pollack , consulting producers ; Mr. O'Brien , Jonathan Groff and Jon Ross , writers ; Daniel Hsia , staff writer .
2007_03_15_1833043	36	A NBC Universal Television Studio and Conaco production .
2007_03_15_1833043	37	WITH : Andy Richter ( Andy Barker ) , Clea Lewis ( Jenny Barker ) , Tony Hale ( Simon ) , Harve Presnell ( Lew Staziak ) and Marshall Manesh ( Wally ) .
2007_03_15_1833045	0	The hard-boiled detective is an American archetype , to urban mythology what the cowboy is to the Wild West .
2007_03_15_1833045	1	At the moment , however , American television seems to prefer its detectives soft-boiled . ''
2007_03_15_1833045	2	Monk '' is about a prissy private eye with obsessive compulsive disorder . ''
2007_03_15_1833045	3	The Closer '' showcases a Southern detective with a secret addiction to sweets .
2007_03_15_1833045	4	That kind of fancy is a natural swing of the pendulum away from the long hegemony of facts and forensics on '' Law & Order '' and '' CSI . ''
2007_03_15_1833045	5	So is outright fantasy .
2007_03_15_1833045	6	The heroines of '' Medium '' and '' Ghost Whisperer '' resolve conflicts by talking to the dead .
2007_03_15_1833045	7	Tonight NBC is trying out another variation on the theme with '' Raines , '' a crime drama starring Jeff Goldblum as a detective who thinks he talks to the dead .
2007_03_15_1833045	8	It sounds a little bit like '' Psych , '' a USA Network series about a private investigator who pretends to be psychic .
2007_03_15_1833045	9	Actually , and in too many ways , '' Raines '' is a homage to '' The Singing Detective , '' a 1986 BBC mini-series by Dennis Potter that starred Michael Gambon as a mystery writer -- named Philip E. Marlow -- who , when hospitalized with acute psoriasis , hovers uncertainly between reality and hallucinated characters from his own novels , some of whom burst into songs from the 1930s .
2007_03_15_1833045	10	Detective Michael Raines does not sing , but he is a Raymond Chandler buff , something he points out right off the top in a '30s film noir first-person narration delivered as the camera freezes on a pulp fiction tableau of a crime scene in Los Angeles .
2007_03_15_1833045	11	Like Chandler 's hero Philip Marlowe , Raines hides a tender heart beneath cynical gibes and sarcastic asides .
2007_03_15_1833045	12	But his grip on reality is a bit more tenuous .
2007_03_15_1833045	13	After his partner is killed during an investigation gone sour , Raines begins to hallucinate that his partner appears at his side , talking over the case with him as they did when he was alive .
2007_03_15_1833045	14	And soon the victims begin to appear before him as well , vanishing only after he solves the crime .
2007_03_15_1833045	15	In the pilot episode a girl hovers around Raines with an enigmatic smile as he puzzles over the clues to her murder .
2007_03_15_1833045	16	She does not give him hints ; instead her personality comes into clearer focus as he fills in details about her life .
2007_03_15_1833045	17	When he learns she grew up in Texas , her accent switches to a drawl . ''
2007_03_15_1833045	18	It 's your imagination , detective , '' she says . ''
2007_03_15_1833045	19	I 'm just the figment . ''
2007_03_15_1833045	20	The hallucination conceit is strange but not necessarily horrible .
2007_03_15_1833045	21	Most television detectives have a defining eccentricity of some sort and nothing-but-the-facts fellows like Sgt. Joe Friday on '' Dragnet '' and Detective Lennie Briscoe on '' Law & Order '' are more the exception than the rule .
2007_03_15_1833045	22	Kojak had his lollipop ; Raymond Burr was in a wheelchair in '' Ironside . ''
2007_03_15_1833045	23	There is something appealing about strong men with a weakness or far-seeing men with a blind spot , sometimes literally : James Franciscus played a sightless insurance investigator in the 1971 series '' Longstreet . ''
2007_03_15_1833045	24	In 2005 Steven Bochco updated the idea with the short-lived '' Blind Justice , '' about a detective who was blinded in the line of duty and then sued for reinstatement .
2007_03_15_1833045	25	The problem with '' Raines '' is that it tries too hard to be too many things at once .
2007_03_15_1833045	26	It 's a Chandleresque film noir .
2007_03_15_1833045	27	No , it 's a ghost story .
2007_03_15_1833045	28	The lead is a sardonic , wisecracking antihero , but he is really an emotional wreck who sees dead people .
2007_03_15_1833045	29	Watching the premiere is a little like seeing a child lose his nerve before a Halloween contest : Red horns and a tail are n't scary enough , so he throws on a rubber Frankenstein mask and insect wings .
2007_03_15_1833045	30	And that is not very complimentary to Mr. Goldblum , an odd and remarkable actor who almost never disappoints .
2007_03_15_1833045	31	His television career has been disappointing however .
2007_03_15_1833045	32	No matter how good he was , none of his series stuck for long , from the smart but quickly canceled '' Tenspeed and Brown Shoe '' in 1980 to '' War Stories '' in 2003 , which began as a two-hour pilot and was never picked up .
2007_03_15_1833045	33	Mr. Goldblum somehow manages to make his way through this muddle of a debut with considerable grace and skill .
2007_03_15_1833045	34	He has always been a natural in roles that call for glibness and slithery sarcasm , but he is also remarkably moving in those moments when he drops the tough facade , his eyes mist over and he shows compassion -- scenes that would make a lesser actor look ridiculous .
2007_03_15_1833045	35	Like a lot of shows '' Raines '' can not be judged solely by its pilot .
2007_03_15_1833045	36	The premiere episode of '' House '' was also cluttered and confused ; it took a few weeks for Hugh Laurie to settle into the persona of Dr. Gregory House , but the show improved drastically as soon as he did .
2007_03_15_1833045	37	Television loves a hateful hero .
2007_03_15_1833045	38	most recently Dr. House faked cancer to get drugs to feed his addiction ; James Spader on '' Boston Legal '' and James Woods on '' Shark '' have been just as sneaky .
2007_03_15_1833045	39	Mr. Goldblum is in their league .
2007_03_15_1833045	40	He does n't need quite so many gimmicks to hold his own .
2007_03_15_1833045	41	Raines NBC , tonight at 10 , Eastern and Pacific times ; 9 , Central time .

2007_03_15_1833047	0	At the Spring North American Championships here , run by the American Contract Bridge League , the winners of the Leventritt Silver Ribbon Pairs on Monday night were Allan Siebert of Little Rock , Ark. , and Alan Stout of Jacksonville , Fla. .
2007_03_15_1833047	1	In the event , for players 55 years and older , they finished one and a half boards ahead of Martin Morris of Wheeling , Ill. , and Charles Nemes of Hinsdale , Ill. , with Richard Gabriel and Joseph Machotka of Chicago third .
2007_03_15_1833047	2	Until this victory Stout was the player with the most master points who had never won a national championship .
2007_03_15_1833047	3	He is No. 15 on the master point list with nearly 29,000 points .
2007_03_15_1833047	4	For Siebert , No. 23 with almost 27,000 , this was a sixth national title .
2007_03_15_1833047	5	In the premier event , the Vanderbilt Knockout Teams , of the original top 16 seeded teams only Nos. 8 , 9 and 11 failed to progress to Wednesday 's round of 16 .
2007_03_15_1833047	6	The storybook run so far has been for the No. 73 seed , Jason Feldman of San Diego , a world junior champion , and three Belgians , Eric Debus , Steve De Roos and Rutger Van Mechelen .
2007_03_15_1833047	7	In the round of 64 on Monday they defeated the No. 9 seed , Chuck Burger of West Bloomfield , Mich. ; Mark Gordon of Purchase , N.Y. ; Steve Landon of Ellicott City , Md. ; Mike Passell of Las Vegas ; Pratap Rajadhyaksha of Powell , Ohio ; and Eddie Wold of Houston , by 3 international match points .
2007_03_15_1833047	8	And Tuesday they won by 28 imps against the No. 24 seed , Garey Hayden of Tucson ; Tony Kasday of Puyallup , Wash. ; and Jon Baldursson , Bjarni Einarsson , Sigurbjorn Haraldsson and Thorlakur Jonsson from Iceland .
2007_03_15_1833047	9	The only woman to hold the title of World Open grand master is Rose Meltzer of Los Gatos , Calif. .
2007_03_15_1833047	10	She is seeded No. 5 with her teammates , Roger Bates of Mesa , Ariz. ; Kyle Larsen of San Francisco ; Alan Sontag of Gaithersburg , Md. ; and Geir Helgemo and Tor Helness from Norway .
2007_03_15_1833047	11	They are in the round of 16 , aided by the diagramed deal .
2007_03_15_1833047	12	Meltzer ( West ) , in the modern style , opened aggressively with one diamond -- never mind the points ; feel the distributional values and good spot-cards .
2007_03_15_1833047	13	Larsen ( East ) responded one no-trump , and South overcalled two hearts .
2007_03_15_1833047	14	Now you might expect West to pass , but she rebid three clubs , knowing that her partner , who had denied a four-card or longer major , held at least seven minor-suit cards .
2007_03_15_1833047	15	( For serious partnerships there is a good case for sacrificing a natural two-no-trump rebid here , using what is called the good-bad two no-trump .
2007_03_15_1833047	16	A rebid of three clubs or three diamonds shows a strong hand .
2007_03_15_1833047	17	With only competitive values , you bid two no-trump .
2007_03_15_1833047	18	Partner then rebids the lowest contract in which he is happy to play . )
2007_03_15_1833047	19	Now North should have cue-bid three diamonds to show game interest in hearts , but , presumably judging that his partner had made a light overcall , he settled for a competitive three hearts .
2007_03_15_1833047	20	When East continued with four clubs , though , a contract that can be defeated by two tricks , South went on to four hearts .
2007_03_15_1833047	21	Meltzer led her fourth-highest club , dummy playing low .
2007_03_15_1833047	22	How should East have defended ?
2007_03_15_1833047	23	It looked so '' obvious '' to win with the club ace and to shift to the spade queen , playing partner for ace-ten-third of spades .
2007_03_15_1833047	24	But Larsen analyzed further .
2007_03_15_1833047	25	What were the hand distributions ?
2007_03_15_1833047	26	It looked as if South 's must be 4-6-1-2 , leaving West 's as 3-1-5-4 .
2007_03_15_1833047	27	Where were the missing 21 high-card points ?
2007_03_15_1833047	28	For South to bid four hearts , surely he had the spade ace , not a nine-count including the spade king .
2007_03_15_1833047	29	Where were four defensive tricks ?
2007_03_15_1833047	30	They had to be two clubs and two spades .
2007_03_15_1833047	31	But if East won with his club ace and switched to the spade queen , South would win with his ace , play a diamond to dummy 's queen and discard his remaining club on the diamond ace .
2007_03_15_1833047	32	Then , benefiting from the 3-3 spade break , declarer would get home .
2007_03_15_1833047	33	Similarly , if East won with his club ace and returned a club , South would get two spades away on dummy 's club queen and diamond ace .
2007_03_15_1833047	34	There was only one chance : East played his club ten at Trick 1 .
2007_03_15_1833047	35	When it held , he cashed his club ace and sat back to await two spade tricks .
2007_03_15_1833048	0	Shortly after moving here last year to take over as director of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art , Michael Govan started looking at houses -- not as a place for him to live but as potential museum pieces .
2007_03_15_1833048	1	His idea -- one that has rarely , if ever , been tried on a large scale by a major museum -- is to collect significant pieces of midcentury residential architecture , including houses by Rudolf M. Schindler , Richard Neutra , Frank Lloyd Wright and his son Lloyd Wright , and to treat them as both museum objects and as residences for curators .
2007_03_15_1833048	2	While he has yet to acquire any properties , Mr. Govan said this week that he certainly had his eye on some , including Frank Gehry 's landmark residence in Santa Monica , a collage of tilting forms .
2007_03_15_1833048	3	In an interview Mr. Gehry confirmed that Mr. Govan had discussed the idea with him but said that no agreements about the house 's future had been reached .
2007_03_15_1833048	4	Mr. Govan , who moved here in March 2006 from New York , where he directed the Dia Art Foundation , said his project had been driven by the immediate impression that in Los Angeles , a city defined by outdoor spaces , architecture is inseparable from art . ''
2007_03_15_1833048	5	It started with an effort to rethink the museum , looking at the resources that are both locally powerful and internationally relevant , '' he said . ''
2007_03_15_1833048	6	It 's clear that the most important architecture in Los Angeles is largely its domestic architecture .
2007_03_15_1833048	7	I 've talked certainly to a number of people who have interesting architecture , and I 'm beginning to talk to other people about raising funds to preserve these works . ''
2007_03_15_1833048	8	The potential cost of the houses varies widely .
2007_03_15_1833048	9	Many of the most distinctive properties , in Beverly Hills or the Hollywood Hills , have most recently sold for millions of dollars .
2007_03_15_1833048	10	Others , like Schindler 's Buck House , on Eighth Street , barely two blocks from the museum , sold for less than half a million dollars in 1995 , although it clearly would be worth more than double that today .
2007_03_15_1833048	11	Mr. Govan was reluctant to discuss his plans in detail , partly because he has taken only '' baby steps , '' he said , but also because he does not want to set off bidding wars for houses in which he is interested .
2007_03_15_1833048	12	He said he hoped the museum could either buy houses or have them donated , the same ways that a museum would go about acquiring paintings or sculptures . ''
2007_03_15_1833048	13	This whole initiative will depend on generosity , '' he said . ''
2007_03_15_1833048	14	In the same way that someone would donate a Picasso , we want people to think of ways to see these houses as works of art and to think about ways to preserve them . ''
2007_03_15_1833048	15	Although he said he had received an '' enthusiastic response '' when he presented the idea to the museum 's trustees , '' we have no funds at the moment '' dedicated to the effort , he added .
2007_03_15_1833048	16	But the idea has already started to generate chatter in the architecture community here .
2007_03_15_1833048	17	Richard Koshalek , president of the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena and a former director of the Museum of Contemporary Art , said Mr. Govan 's effort was '' not only crucial for the city of Los Angeles but for the history of modern architecture . '' ''
2007_03_15_1833048	18	Architects learn from other architects , '' Mr. Koshalek said . ''
2007_03_15_1833048	19	This history will be lost if people like Michael do not take this kind of initiative . ''
2007_03_15_1833048	20	While owning an architecturally significant house in Los Angeles has long carried a certain cachet , many potentially valuable works have fallen into disrepair or been greatly altered by renovations undertaken by a succession of owners . ''
2007_03_15_1833048	21	A number of them have n't been touched , '' Mr. Govan said . ''
2007_03_15_1833048	22	But many have been badly renovated and fundamentally changed .
2007_03_15_1833048	23	So I think it 's kind of the last chance to try to preserve a group of these as a collection . ''
2007_03_15_1833048	24	Mr. Govan 's idea is perhaps all the more remarkable because the Los Angeles County Museum does not have a department of architecture or design , unlike some older institutions , including the Museum of Modern Art in New York .
2007_03_15_1833048	25	But one of the museum 's first acquisitions after Mr. Govan moved to Los Angeles , after 12 years as director of Dia , was a high-rise office interior by the Modernist architect John Lautner .
2007_03_15_1833048	26	The Lautner office was formerly owned by James F. Goldstein , a real-estate investor who had Lautner design the space in 1987 for the 20th floor in a building in Century City , the commercial development on Santa Monica Boulevard in west Los Angeles .
2007_03_15_1833048	27	In 2005 Mr. Goldstein was informed that his lease for the space would not be renewed , and a foundation devoted to saving Lautner works began seeking a patron who would preserve the space .
2007_03_15_1833048	28	The Los Angeles County Museum initially turned down the proposal because museum officials felt it did not have the room to display the 800-square-foot office .
2007_03_15_1833048	29	But once Mr. Govan arrived , he seized the opportunity to acquire the work for an undisclosed amount and use it not as an exhibit but as an office -- specifically , his .
2007_03_15_1833048	30	The museum now plans to install the office , which includes copper walls , a wood ceiling and a floor of black slate , as part of the renovation of the May Company building , a former department store that is on the western edge of the museum 's 20-acre campus on Wilshire Boulevard .
2007_03_15_1833048	31	That renovation is planned for 2008 or 2009 , and Mr. Govan said he hoped to use the space as his regular office , allowing visitors access to it as an exhibit on weekends .
2007_03_15_1833048	32	Similarly , he said he hoped to use the houses that he collects not strictly as museum pieces but as housing for museum staff members , a perk that he said he believed would help the museum attract new curatorial talent . ''
2007_03_15_1833048	33	A lot of curators here have sought out interesting houses , '' he said . ''
2007_03_15_1833048	34	I thought , ` You could just have house tours on a regular basis to allow the public to have access to them . ' ''
2007_03_15_1833048	35	Although it does not have a design collection as such , the Los Angeles County Museum of Art has hardly ignored the city 's architectural history .
2007_03_15_1833048	36	In 1987 it organized a tour in the Silver Lake community of houses by Schindler , Neutra and other architects of the 1920s , '30s , '40s and '50s .
2007_03_15_1833048	37	In 1965 the museum published '' A Guide to Southern California Architecture , '' a book that , although out of print , is prized by real-estate agents here who specialize in architectural gems .
2007_03_15_1833048	38	Various Los Angeles organizations have also sponsored tours of houses that were built as part of the Case Study program : two dozen prototypes of modern architecture , by Charles and Ray Eames , Neutra and Pierre Koenig , among others , that were commissioned by Art & Architecture magazine and built from 1945 to 1964 .
2007_03_15_1833048	39	Silver Lake , an area around a man-made reservoir in the hills east of Hollywood , is the site of dozens of houses that would be potential acquisitions for the museum .
2007_03_15_1833048	40	The 2200 block of Silver Lake Boulevard , for example , has no fewer than five houses by Neutra , who was encouraged to migrate from Vienna to Los Angeles by Schindler , who was himself born in Austria and had worked in Chicago and Los Angeles as a construction supervisor for Frank Lloyd Wright .
2007_03_15_1833048	41	Schindler 's work is also ubiquitous around Los Angeles .
2007_03_15_1833048	42	In 2001 the magazine ArtForum listed 32 significant works by Schindler , several in the parts of Los Angeles that visitors to the city rarely get to , including Torrance , Glendale , South Central and Woodland Hills .
2007_03_15_1833048	43	Mr. Govan said that because the institution was a county museum , he did not intend to limit his collection to the area immediately around the museum 's west Los Angeles location .
2007_03_15_1833048	44	With Mr. Govan 's plans already being discussed in architecture and real estate circles , the museum is certain to face some competition to acquire properties , including that ofMr .
2007_03_15_1833048	45	His Santa Monica house , built in 1978 and remodeled in 1993 , is known for its distinctive exteriors , which include corrugated metal , plywood and chain-link fencing .
2007_03_15_1833048	46	It is also in the sights of the National Trust for Historic Preservation , Mr. Gehry said , which has talked to him about its registering the house or acquiring it once he completes a new residence in nearby Venice , Calif. '' In the meantime , '' Mr. Gehry said , '' I 'm living in it . ''
2007_03_15_1833048	47	Correction : March 31 , 2007 , Saturday An article in The Arts on March 15 about a plan by the director of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art , Michael Govan , to collect pieces of significant residential architecture referred incorrectly to the ownership of an office designed by the architect John Lautner , which the museum intends to install both as an exhibit and for use by Mr. Govan .
2007_03_15_1833048	48	It is on long-term loan to the museum from the John Lautner Foundation , which owns the work ; the museum did not acquire it for an undisclosed amount .
2007_03_15_1833048	49	The article also misstated the title of a book published by the museum in 1965 .
2007_03_15_1833048	50	It is '' A Guide to Architecture in Southern California , '' not '' A Guide to Southern California Architecture . ''
2007_03_15_1833049	0	THE house that Robin Howe and her husband , Andy Grossman , share in Bridgehampton , N.Y. , is only a year old , but their living room floor dates back a century .
2007_03_15_1833049	1	Made of wide-plank teak , the floorboards have '' a lived-in feel that is attractive and old and gentle on the feet , '' said Ms. Howe , a fashion designer .
2007_03_15_1833049	2	Before the boards were in Ms. Howe 's living room they were in the McCloud , Calif. , warehouse of TerraMai , a company that sells so-called '' reclaimed '' wood from around the world ; before that , they were the floors and walls of a factory , probably near the Burmese border in Thailand , 8,000 miles from Long Island .
2007_03_15_1833049	3	As Southeast Asia continues to modernize , many teak-wood homes and buildings like that factory are being torn down and replaced with Western-style brick or concrete ones .
2007_03_15_1833049	4	While this architectural turnover has been going on for decades , in recent years American companies like TerraMai have increasingly been buying up the old-growth teak wood and selling it to homeowners like Ms. Howe , which has raised some concerns among preservationists . ''
2007_03_15_1833049	5	In the last three years , our sales of reclaimed teak have tripled , '' said Erika Carpenter , TerraMai 's co-founder . ''
2007_03_15_1833049	6	People are becoming aware , appreciating the material and designing their projects around it . ''
2007_03_15_1833049	7	In 2006 , the company disassembled 12 structures in Southeast Asia , and this year Ms. Carpenter expects to tear down about 20 .
2007_03_15_1833049	8	The wood , which sells in the United States for between $ 16.50 a square foot and $ 30 a board foot -- slightly more than new teak from the same region would cost -- is re-milled and used to make flooring , decking , countertops , staircases and cabinetry , among other things .
2007_03_15_1833049	9	( For teak flooring , the cost is about three times that of a typical oak floor . )
2007_03_15_1833049	10	Global Surroundings , a furnishings manufacturer near Phoenix , has had similar success with its Rusteaka and ChicTeak lines of outdoor furniture made from Indonesian homes .
2007_03_15_1833049	11	According to J. L. Jackson , the company 's founder , Global Surroundings imported six shipping containers of vintage teak furniture in 2006 and will double that number this year .
2007_03_15_1833049	12	Ms. Jackson said she initially had difficulty convincing retailers to stock her tables and chairs , but an increased interest in the environmental benefits of recycled resources has helped spark sales , as has the popularity of outdoor furniture , for which old teak is well suited .
2007_03_15_1833049	13	Then there 's the matter of character . ''
2007_03_15_1833049	14	You have to buy into it , and understand that this is a great story when you 're sitting around your coffee table , '' she said .
2007_03_15_1833049	15	Old teak lumber seems to hold much the same appeal for many Americans . ''
2007_03_15_1833049	16	They 've definitely had previous lives , '' Ms. Howe said of her floorboards . ''
2007_03_15_1833049	17	There 's a history in them that may be hundreds of years old , and I 've become a part of that . ''
2007_03_15_1833049	18	Not everyone , though , is happy to see Westerners like Ms. Howe claiming a place in that history .
2007_03_15_1833049	19	Tanet Charoenmuang , the vice president of the Urban Development Institute Foundation in Chiang Mai , Thailand , which advocates for historical preservation in the rapidly modernizing city , is worried that his country is slowly losing its identity , as old teak villas , docks , hotels , tobacco barns and granaries vanish . ''
2007_03_15_1833049	20	Houses are sold one after another after another , and , finally , all gone , '' Dr. Tanet said . ''
2007_03_15_1833049	21	Finally , the culture will be gone , too . ''
2007_03_15_1833049	22	Although Ms. Carpenter , like other importers of reclaimed wood , says that she only purchases buildings that were going to be demolished anyway , or are already for sale , Dr. Tanet believes the money offered by these dealers inevitably encourages tear-downs . ''
2007_03_15_1833049	23	At first , someone may have never thought of selling '' a home , he said , but the financial incentive , combined with the growing popularity of Western-style brick and concrete houses with modern conveniences like air-conditioning , has spurred the selling off of teak .
2007_03_15_1833049	24	The result , Dr. Tanet said , is that '' the wooden culture gives way to the concrete . ''
2007_03_15_1833049	25	Nonetheless , Jeffrey Hayward , an auditor for the Rainforest Alliance conservation organization , who lived on the island of Java in Indonesia for six years , sees some benefit in the demand for vintage teak , in that it promotes reuse . ''
2007_03_15_1833049	26	If there was no market for recycled teak , '' said Mr. Hayward , who witnessed a similar selling off on Java , '' it would basically end up as waste . ''
2007_03_15_1833049	27	The perceived ecological advantages of building with vintage teak appealed to Dr. Richard Ostreicher , a California-based dermatologist who drives a hybrid car and owns a vacation house in Hawaii that uses solar power .
2007_03_15_1833049	28	When he wanted to put a gazebo in his Oakland backyard two years ago , he bypassed the big-box home stores and found a structure made of teak from an old joglo , an ornate style of Indonesian house . ''
2007_03_15_1833049	29	It 's original , it 's gorgeous and you 're not taking down any new trees , '' said Dr. Ostreicher , who bought the gazebo from Gado Gado International , a furniture and crafts importer in Santa Rosa , Calif. , paying about $ 11,000 . ''
2007_03_15_1833049	30	This is a beautiful work of art , and if it were just left on the road somewhere it might be lost . ''
2007_03_15_1833049	31	Teak is '' a pretty wood , it 's extremely durable and it 's multipurpose , '' said Harvey Green , the author of '' Wood : Craft , Culture , History '' ( Viking , 2006 ) , explaining teak 's centuries-old popularity with furniture makers and shipbuilders , who valued the way its resin repelled water , rot and termites .
2007_03_15_1833049	32	While teak is still grown and harvested in parts of Southeast Asia , salvaged wood is especially prized , Mr. Green said , because much of it came from old-growth forests , which produce the sturdiest and handsomest lumber .
2007_03_15_1833049	33	After years of these supplies being depleted , many countries in the region have strict laws limiting over-harvesting , and old-growth teak has become a rare commodity , according to Mr. Hayward .
2007_03_15_1833049	34	Finding and exporting this sought-after old-growth teak is the job of hunters like Ms. Carpenter , who has gone on buying trips to Southeast Asia every one to three months since TerraMai began selling teak in 2000 .
2007_03_15_1833049	35	On one such trip last July , she visited a village outside Chiang Mai , on a tip from one of TerraMai 's local agents that a woman there was interested in selling her house .
2007_03_15_1833049	36	Approaching the home in question , one of a row of simple but sturdy wooden structures raised on stilts , she scratched a support beam , sniffing for the sharp , leathery smell of teak .
2007_03_15_1833049	37	A white-haired woman sitting at a table nearby pointed to garlic drying beneath the raised floor and asked Ms. Carpenter if she had come to buy some . ''
2007_03_15_1833049	38	No , '' Ms. Carpenter told the old woman in Thai , '' I came to buy the house . ''
2007_03_15_1833049	39	After locating the property owner , a middle-aged woman , Ms. Carpenter spoke to her through an interpreter .
2007_03_15_1833049	40	The owner explained that she had inherited the house from a relative , but did not need it .
2007_03_15_1833049	41	Her reason for selling to Ms. Carpenter was simple : If the home were put on the local market , the lot would bring a modest sum , but traders in salvaged teak -- both local buyers and foreigners like Ms. Carpenter -- are willing to pay hundreds of dollars per cubic meter , or more than $ 50,000 for an entire house .
2007_03_15_1833049	42	Many homeowners in Southeast Asia use teak '' like a bank , '' said Philippe Guizol , a researcher who frequently works with the Center for International Forestry Research , a conservation organization based in Indonesia . ''
2007_03_15_1833049	43	If you need cash and you have teak in your floor , you just sell it , '' Mr. Guizol said .
2007_03_15_1833049	44	But Ms. Carpenter says she avoids buying houses that people would otherwise continue living in , as well as historic landmarks like temples .
2007_03_15_1833049	45	She noted that she is required by the Thai government to process the wood -- re-mill or dry it -- before shipping it to the United States , so the country 's resources are not being removed without an investment in local labor .
2007_03_15_1833049	46	Importers point out that the wood can last another century or more , even if the shift in context is stark , said Mark Suess , a designer for Global Surroundings .
2007_03_15_1833049	47	In his home in St. Cloud , Minn. , the pocked floorboards running from the front door to the dining room were planed smooth years earlier for use in Indonesian homes .
2007_03_15_1833049	48	The cabinet where his family stores cookbooks was for decades an altar and reliquary where people prayed .
2007_03_15_1833049	49	The result is an exchange of cultural styles , as Americans like Mr. Suess embrace an old-fashioned Asian aesthetic , while many Southeast Asians look to contemporary Western design .
2007_03_15_1833049	50	Ms. Howe of Bridgehampton , who frequently travels to Southeast Asia for business , said that in the last decade the replacement of wooden structures with Western-style buildings has been obvious . ''
2007_03_15_1833049	51	It seems almost natural that they would be changing and updating , '' she said . ''
2007_03_15_1833049	52	And then one day they 'll probably want their old teak back again . ''
2007_03_15_1833051	0	In architectural terms , few cities have endured more abuse than Moscow has during the last decade or so , from the ruthless demolition of major historic landmarks to the boom in garish faux-historical reproductions .
2007_03_15_1833051	1	So I suppose the news that Norman Foster , one of the world 's most talented architects , has designed a glorified mall in Moscow should n't seem tragic .
2007_03_15_1833051	2	The project will replace one of the most notorious buildings of the Soviet period , the gargantuan 1960s-era Rossiya Hotel , on a critical site overlooking St. Basil 's Cathedral and the Kremlin .
2007_03_15_1833051	3	A sleek complex of buildings with classical overtones , it will include 470,000 square feet of retail space , four hotels and a 2,500-seat performance hall , making it the largest single development in the historic core of Moscow since the Soviet empire collapsed 15 years ago .
2007_03_15_1833051	4	While Mr. Foster 's participation may hearten those who hope to raise the city 's architectural standards , this is clearly not one of his better designs .
2007_03_15_1833051	5	It lacks the structural flamboyance of his most memorable buildings , and its strange blend of classical and modern elements edges dangerously close to parody -- the kind of generic soft-core historicism we see so often in large-scale developments in cities striving to enter the global marketplace .
2007_03_15_1833051	6	It is a sanitized view of the ferocious architectural clashes that shaped this city for centuries and made such a haunting apparition .
2007_03_15_1833051	7	The demolition of the Rossiya was also part of a cleansing process .
2007_03_15_1833051	8	I 'll admit that its hulking concrete-and-glass shell was hardly a shining example of 1960s architecture .
2007_03_15_1833051	9	Having stayed there as a student in the '70s , I vaguely recall its labyrinthine corridors , the cockroaches , the threadbare rooms legendarily littered with bugging devices .
2007_03_15_1833051	10	But from the perspective of 2007 , it had a refreshing , unadorned directness .
2007_03_15_1833051	11	And its destruction must be understood as part of a broader effort to erase the memory of seven decades of Soviet rule .
2007_03_15_1833051	12	The Moscow Hotel , a major landmark from the Stalinist era , is gone .
2007_03_15_1833051	13	Buildings from the late 1920s , like Moisei Ginzburg 's Narkomfin Housing and Konstantin Melnikov 's workers ' clubs , among the most influential works of the 20th century , are in ruins .
2007_03_15_1833051	14	More often than not , this history is being replaced with a theme-park version of pre-Revolutionary Russia that glosses over Moscow 's real history .
2007_03_15_1833051	15	Although Mr. Foster 's design never quite descends to this level , its bland slickness is disturbing in its own way .
2007_03_15_1833051	16	The biggest strength of this project is as an urban plan .
2007_03_15_1833051	17	Mr. Foster begins by restoring portions of the historic street grid removed when the Rossiya Hotel was built , which is a reasonable enough approach .
2007_03_15_1833051	18	Two major pedestrian streets are then cut diagonally through the site .
2007_03_15_1833051	19	The main one runs from the edge of the Moscow River toward St. Basil 's Cathedral , with its brightly colored onion domes , and Red Square .
2007_03_15_1833051	20	A second is set on an axis with the distant dome of the Cathedral of Christ the Savior and the local metro station , another Stalinist landmark .
2007_03_15_1833051	21	The crisscrossing streets divide the site into irregular parcels with a triangular plaza at the center that is the heart of the new complex .
2007_03_15_1833051	22	By using the street grid to frame views of nearby monuments , Mr. Foster forges a powerful visual relationship with the surrounding city , orienting you within a historical narrative that stretches from medieval Russia through the Soviet era to the present .
2007_03_15_1833051	23	The view of the Cathedral of Christ the Savior , a gaudy fake that sums up the new Moscow , is the culmination of that history .
2007_03_15_1833051	24	Stalin blew up the original church in the 1930s to make way for the Palace of the Soviets , but it was never completed , and Khrushchev had one of the world 's largest outdoor swimming pools built there .
2007_03_15_1833051	25	After the fall of the Soviet Union , the pool was torn up too , and the church was rebuilt as an ersatz version of the original , rising atop a multistory garage .
2007_03_15_1833051	26	The site 's context demands a powerful statement about the present .
2007_03_15_1833051	27	But the individual buildings Mr. Foster has designed fail us .
2007_03_15_1833051	28	Although still nothing more than sketches , they are adorned with a bizarre blend of historical references .
2007_03_15_1833051	29	Their forms are essentially traditional courtyard blocks with street-level shops connected by a series of covered porticoes .
2007_03_15_1833051	30	The exterior of the performance hall is lined with arcades .
2007_03_15_1833051	31	And the complex sits atop a vast underground mall whose internal corridors reflect the street grid above .
2007_03_15_1833051	32	The ceremonial axis is straight out of Haussmann 's Paris .
2007_03_15_1833051	33	The porticoes evoke the Rue de Rivoli .
2007_03_15_1833051	34	The arcaded facades vaguely conjure the stripped-down classicism of the E.U.R. quarter in Rome , a pinnacle of Fascist architecture .
2007_03_15_1833051	35	( There are no onion domes in the scheme , but Mr. Foster could never have lived that down with his colleagues . )
2007_03_15_1833051	36	Mr. Foster is known as an architect who is more than willing to appease big corporate clients .
2007_03_15_1833051	37	His best buildings have been designed for people longing for something fresh .
2007_03_15_1833051	38	In this case his client is the Russian developer S.T.T. .
2007_03_15_1833051	39	While he doubtless must placate Muscovites who want to obliterate bad memories , what he ends up with is a vague nostalgia , even if his project is unquestionably superior to the postmodernist nonsense that was rising all over Moscow in the 1990s .
2007_03_15_1833051	40	But let 's try to be optimistic .
2007_03_15_1833051	41	In some ways the plan can be seen as a positive turning point .
2007_03_15_1833051	42	Only a few years ago it seemed that Moscow was in the throes of a building boom that was so violent and corrupt that it appeared certain that swaths of precious history would be erased .
2007_03_15_1833051	43	Since then , some patrons have emerged to ensure that a handful of threatened Soviet landmarks are being restored .
2007_03_15_1833051	44	Mr. Foster 's megacomplex could be viewed as a step toward enlightenment , a tentative , somewhat mediocre design that at least tackles the challenge of serious planning in one of the world 's most intriguing cities .
2007_03_15_1833051	45	What we 're still waiting for is the architecture .
2007_03_15_1833052	0	The Russian National Orchestra , founded by the pianist and conductor Mikhail Pletnev in 1990 , began life as a post-Soviet assertion of private enterprise .
2007_03_15_1833052	1	It proclaimed itself independent of government sponsorship , and it stresses to this day that it runs entirely on private financing .
2007_03_15_1833052	2	That is its sociopolitical message .
2007_03_15_1833052	3	Musically it has always been about harnessing the power and precision of the young musicians , who train like gymnasts in Russia 's conservatories , and giving the kind of streamlined performances that , as Westerners learned belatedly , the more famous and established Russian orchestras were no longer producing consistently .
2007_03_15_1833052	4	What this orchestra has taken a while to develop is a distinct sonic thumbprint .
2007_03_15_1833052	5	But in its performance at Avery Fisher Hall on Tuesday evening , with Vladimir Jurowski , its principal guest conductor , on the podium , its personality seemed clearer than ever .
2007_03_15_1833052	6	This is an orchestra that does not strive for lushness , as many American ensembles do , or for a particular woodwind or string timbre , which is an identifying trait of certain central European orchestras .
2007_03_15_1833052	7	Instead its sound is remarkably trim and focused , with sharp-edged , virtuosic brass playing as one of its hallmarks but also a polished ( if never exactly silken ) string sound and agile woodwind work .
2007_03_15_1833052	8	Mr. Jurowski played on these qualities with touches of his own .
2007_03_15_1833052	9	He began with Stravinsky 's early '' Scherzo Fantastique '' ( 1908 ) , a work of vibrant orchestral hues but barely a hint of the rhythmic energy that would make '' The Rite of Spring '' so incendiary only five years later .
2007_03_15_1833052	10	Here the work 's shortcomings were treated as an opportunity : Mr. Jurowski made the most of its links to Russian Romanticism , focusing on its sparkling textures , its athletic trumpet parts and its bright string hues , all effects that sounded tailor-made for this orchestra .
2007_03_15_1833052	11	The Tchaikovsky Violin Concerto was the program 's centerpiece , with Leonidas Kavakos giving a sizzling account of the solo line .
2007_03_15_1833052	12	Mr. Jurowski 's end of things was idiosyncratic .
2007_03_15_1833052	13	The phrasing of the opening tutti , for example , was dry , clipped and sharply accented , and that effect resurfaced later in the movement and again in the finale .
2007_03_15_1833052	14	It was n't objectionable , just a bit odd , and in any case Mr. Kavakos 's balance of pyrotechnics and lyricism usually wrested the attention and kept one from dwelling on the orchestral peculiarities .
2007_03_15_1833052	15	Mr. Kavakos also offered a solo encore , a high-energy account of the '' Furies '' movement from Ysae 's Sonata No. 2 .
2007_03_15_1833052	16	The orchestral playing was unimpeachable in the Tchaikovsky and better than that -- virtuosic , dark-hued and almost opulent -- in Prokofiev 's Symphony No. 5 , which closed the concert .
2007_03_15_1833052	17	The Russian National Orchestra , with Mikhail Pletnev , conductor , and Nikolai Lugansky , piano soloist , will perform tomorrow at the Troy Savings Bank Music Hall in Albany , (518) 273-0038 ; and Sunday at Avery Fisher Hall , Lincoln Center , (212) 721-6500 .
2007_03_15_1833054	0	Whatever other reasons may explain the lack of women 's voices on the nation 's op-ed pages , the lack of women asking to be there is clearly part of the problem .
2007_03_15_1833054	1	Many opinion page editors at major newspapers across the country say that 65 or 75 percent of unsolicited manuscripts , or more , come from men .
2007_03_15_1833054	2	The obvious solution , at least to Catherine Orenstein , an author , activist and occasional op-ed page contributor herself , was to get more women to submit essays .
2007_03_15_1833054	3	To that end Ms. Orenstein has been training women at universities , foundations and corporations to write essays and get them published .
2007_03_15_1833054	4	Uproars over the sparse numbers of women in newspapers , or on news programs , in magazines , and on best-seller lists regularly erupt every couple of years .
2007_03_15_1833054	5	A doozy occurred in 2005 , after the liberal commentator Susan Estrich and Michael Kinsley , then editor of The Los Angeles Times 's opinion pages , got into a nasty scuffle over the lack of female columnists .
2007_03_15_1833054	6	That dustup is what motivated Ms. Orenstein to take her op-ed show on the road , which she has done with support from the Woodhull Institute , an ethics and leadership group for women . ''
2007_03_15_1833054	7	It 's a teachable form , '' Ms. Orenstein said recently over coffee and eggs . ''
2007_03_15_1833054	8	It 's not like writing Hemingway .
2007_03_15_1833054	9	You show people the basics of a good argument , what constitutes good evidence , what 's a news hook , what 's the etiquette of a pitch . ''
2007_03_15_1833054	10	Over the past 18 months several hundred women and men ( though in fewer numbers ) have taken the seminar , which can cost a group up to $ 5,000 , Ms. Orenstein said ( although she has also donated her services ) .
2007_03_15_1833054	11	She has not kept records , but said about two dozen former students have sent her clips of their published essays to say thank you .
2007_03_15_1833054	12	Suzanne Grossman at Woodhull did n't have comprehensive statistics but said that the first pilot session for a dozen women at a Woodhull retreat produced 12 op-ed articles .
2007_03_15_1833054	13	( Some participants wrote more than one . ) ''
2007_03_15_1833054	14	I try to convey the idea that there is a responsibility , '' she said . ''
2007_03_15_1833054	15	Op-ed pages are so enormously powerful .
2007_03_15_1833054	16	It 's one of the few places open to the public .
2007_03_15_1833054	17	Where else is someone like me going to get access ?
2007_03_15_1833054	18	It 's not like I can call up the White House : ` Hello ? ' ''
2007_03_15_1833054	19	About 30 women who also are not in the habit of calling up the White House gathered Monday evening for one of Ms. Orenstein 's seminars .
2007_03_15_1833054	20	Eighteen , mostly from nonprofit organizations , sat around a large conference table in Manhattan against a dazzling backdrop of New York City 's skyline at sunset , while a dozen or so listened in through a speaker phone in Washington .
2007_03_15_1833054	21	They had been invited by SheSource , an online database of women experts , financed by the White House Project , a women 's leadership organization , Fenton Communications and the Women 's Funding Network .
2007_03_15_1833054	22	Ms. Orenstein asked : Could every woman at the large rectangular table name one specific subject that she is an expert in and say why ?
2007_03_15_1833054	23	The author of '' Little Red Riding Hood Uncloaked : Sex , Morality and the Evolution of a Fairy Tale , '' Ms. Orenstein began by saying , '' Little Red Riding Hood '' and writing the words in orange marker on an oversize white pad .
2007_03_15_1833054	24	Of the next four women who spoke , three started with a qualification or apology . ''
2007_03_15_1833054	25	I 'm really too young to be an expert in anything , '' said Caitlin Petre , 23 . ''
2007_03_15_1833054	26	Let 's stop , '' Ms. Orenstein said . ''
2007_03_15_1833054	27	It happens in every single session I do with women , and it 's never happened with men . ''
2007_03_15_1833054	28	Women tend to back away from '' what we know and why we know it , '' she said .
2007_03_15_1833054	29	Next she asked the participants why they thought it important to write op-ed articles .
2007_03_15_1833054	30	Women shouted : '' Change the world , '' '' shape public debate , '' '' offer a new perspective , '' '' influence public policy . '' ''
2007_03_15_1833054	31	You are all such do-gooders , '' Ms. Orenstein said laughing , '' I love this . ''
2007_03_15_1833054	32	She then proceeded to create another kind of list that included fame , money , offers of books , television series and jobs .
2007_03_15_1833054	33	The Rev. Dr. Katherine Hancock Ragsdale , an Episcopal priest and the executive director of Political Research Associates in Boston , frowned . ''
2007_03_15_1833054	34	It 's not why I do it , '' she said .
2007_03_15_1833054	35	That , Ms. Orenstein declared , is a typically female response : '' I never had a man say , ` That 's not why I do it . ' '' ''
2007_03_15_1833054	36	What I want to suggest to you , '' she continued , is that the personal and the public interests are not at odds , and '' the belief that they are mutually exclusive has kept women out of power . ''
2007_03_15_1833054	37	Do n't you want money , credibility , access to aid in your cause ?
2007_03_15_1833054	38	Cristina Page , a spokeswoman for Birth Control Watch in Washington , leaned forward . ''
2007_03_15_1833054	39	I 've never heard anyone say that before , '' she said . ''
2007_03_15_1833054	40	What you 've just said is so important .
2007_03_15_1833054	41	It 's liberating . ''
2007_03_15_1833054	42	Other attendees were similarly enthusiastic after the two-and-a-half-hour session .
2007_03_15_1833054	43	Maureen Lane , a professor at Hunter College and a member of the Drum Major Institute , a research think tank , had taken a longer version of the op-ed writing seminar about 18 months earlier . ''
2007_03_15_1833054	44	It takes me a while to learn , '' she said of her repeat visit . ''
2007_03_15_1833054	45	This is not just ` how you buy real estate and make a fortune , ' '' she said , '' This is thought through . ''
2007_03_15_1833054	46	During the seminar Ms. Orenstein laid out a basic formula for writing a 750-word op-ed piece ( with the caution that '' common sense trumps everything I say '' ) : a lead connected to a news hook , a thesis , three points of evidence , conclusion .
2007_03_15_1833054	47	And do n't forget the '' to be sure '' paragraph in order to pre-empt your opponents ' comeback , she instructed .
2007_03_15_1833054	48	Then she handed out a few samples , including one that a student had published in The Washington Post after completing the training .
2007_03_15_1833054	49	Small clusters of women formed as they worked to trace the formula 's various ingredients in an op-ed article .
2007_03_15_1833054	50	A bunch of women joined together on one side of the table to discuss an op-ed piece by Ms. Orenstein that appeared in June 2004 in The New York Times on the remake of the movie '' The Stepford Wives . '' ''
2007_03_15_1833054	51	The thesis is how we 've internalized a piece of Stepford , '' said Serena Fong , a member of Catalyst , a research organization for women in business .
2007_03_15_1833054	52	Dr. Ragsdale said , '' We started thinking that was the thesis , '' but then decided that '' the point is we have n't come such a long way . '' ''
2007_03_15_1833054	53	Is that the first point or the thesis ? ''
2007_03_15_1833054	54	Maybe there are two theses , someone helpfully suggested .
2007_03_15_1833054	55	A few moments later Dr. Ragsdale noted , '' I 'm not a group exercise kind of person . ''
2007_03_15_1833054	56	Afterward each group got up to present its conclusions . ''
2007_03_15_1833054	57	Is there a to-be-sure paragraph ? ''
2007_03_15_1833054	58	Ms. Orenstein asked the first up .
2007_03_15_1833054	59	Ms. Lane replied : '' Yes , and it begins : ` To be sure . ' ''
2007_03_15_1833054	60	After the presentations Ms. Orenstein returned to the orange-colored words '' Little Red Riding Hood '' written on the pad , saying that if she had limited herself to that subject , her contribution to public debate would be about the size of a tack . ''
2007_03_15_1833054	61	I would have to reframe myself , '' she said , drawing a triangle around the words .
2007_03_15_1833054	62	At each of the three points she explained how she set about enlarging her area of expertise : from Riding Hood to female heroines to women ; from fairy tales to myths to stories we tell and are told ; from the nursery to popular culture .
2007_03_15_1833054	63	To close the evening she asked Sondra Harris , the director of corporate public relations at Charles Schwab , to stand by the pad and go through the same process .
2007_03_15_1833054	64	Ms. Harris walked to the easel and , as she spoke , Ms. Orenstein wrote , '' Teaching women how to invest , '' which quickly grew intothree expansive categories , Money , Women and Power , that were wide-ranging and enticing .
2007_03_15_1833054	65	As Ms. Page said , '' You can definitely have a TV series come out of that . ''
2007_03_15_1833055	0	As one of this summer 's most anticipated and heavily marketed movies , '' Spider-Man 3 , '' the latest in the Sony Pictures blockbuster superhero series , will be hard to miss .
2007_03_15_1833055	1	But this week at ShoWest , the movie industry 's annual convention for thousands of theater owners , filling four days and two Las Vegas hotels , a giant poster in the convention area is pretty much all the promotion it is getting .
2007_03_15_1833055	2	Three years ago , leading up to '' Spider-Man 2 , '' Sony 's efforts did not cut such a low profile .
2007_03_15_1833055	3	Conventiongoers were treated to a special preview of the main action sequence , as spider-costumed acrobats descended on black cables from the ceiling of Le Theatre Des Arts at the Paris Hotel here .
2007_03_15_1833055	4	The other major Hollywood studios are following similar no-frills scripts at what is the principal industry showcase for mainstream movies .
2007_03_15_1833055	5	A frayed relationship between the major studios and exhibitors , cost-cutting across the board and consolidation among the national theater chains has turned a promotional event for big-budget movies into one that is not promoting very many big-budget movies . ''
2007_03_15_1833055	6	It 's expensive , '' explained Richard Cook , the chairman of Walt Disney Studios .
2007_03_15_1833055	7	Last year Disney screened Pixar 's '' Cars '' for the convention , but on Tuesday it showed only a trailer of '' Pirates of the Caribbean : At World 's End , '' and 12 minutes of the next Pixar animated movie , '' Ratatouille . '' ''
2007_03_15_1833055	8	You still have to sell the movie , '' he added . ''
2007_03_15_1833055	9	You just do it in a different way . ''
2007_03_15_1833055	10	Mass events at places like ShoWest have been replaced by one-on-one contact with the exhibitors responsible for the lion 's share of American cineplexes , like AMC , Regal and Cinemark .
2007_03_15_1833055	11	Studio executives say they can cover most of the country with a few phone calls or a visit to an exhibitor 's headquarters in Kansas City , Mo. , or Knoxville , Tenn. .
2007_03_15_1833055	12	Mr. Cook said Disney executives would spend much of ShoWest in private meetings with the large exhibitors , promoting coming movies .
2007_03_15_1833055	13	And just a couple of weeks ago , Paramount played host on its Hollywood lot to executives from a small , regional chain , Pacific Theaters , showing them scenes from two high-end movies still in production , '' Drillbit Taylor '' and '' Sweeney Todd . ''
2007_03_15_1833055	14	As recently as three years ago , exhibitors were treated to the full-on glamour treatment by Paramount , with a cavalcade of stars from the studio 's lineup of films , including Gwyneth Paltrow , Jim Carrey , Meryl Streep and a dozen others , attending a lavish dinner for the ShoWest delegates .
2007_03_15_1833055	15	The cost for the evening , according to a Paramount executive , was close to $ 6 million .
2007_03_15_1833055	16	It did not , however , result in greater theatrical bookings for Paramount films . ''
2007_03_15_1833055	17	In the old days , when we had a huge dais of stars , it was pretty sexy and cool , '' said Rory Bruer , the domestic distribution president for Sony . ''
2007_03_15_1833055	18	Now ShoWest has evolved in a far more practical , business manner .
2007_03_15_1833055	19	It 's become about the whole operational aspect of theaters . ''
2007_03_15_1833055	20	This means presentations about new projectors and sound systems , and debates over advertising costs , the rating systems and the relative merits of popcorn makers .
2007_03_15_1833055	21	Delegates are also invited to sample panels , like one about the hearing-impaired and another on the dangers of trans fat at the concession stand . ''
2007_03_15_1833055	22	Nuts and bolts , that 's why we come -- for the seminars , the trade show , '' said Brian MacLeod , the vice president for operations at Empire Theaters , a 54-theater chain based in Canada . ''
2007_03_15_1833055	23	It 's always nice to see the stars , but that does n't help me with my job directly . ''
2007_03_15_1833055	24	But the shift at ShoWest is also a sign of continuing tension between the Hollywood studios and the exhibition chains , a demotion of sorts , as festivals in places like Toronto and even Venice have absorbed more attention from the news media .
2007_03_15_1833055	25	Though the industry 's domestic box-office gross revenues rose 5.5 percent in 2006 after a disastrous drop in 2005 ( and is off to a good start this year , thanks to movies like '' 300 '' and '' Ghost Rider '' ) , the major studios still complain that theaters are not doing enough to lure customers off their couches and into the multiplex .
2007_03_15_1833055	26	Among the studios ' desires : hiring more ushers to cut down on cellphone use and other noise .
2007_03_15_1833055	27	Meanwhile , exhibitors resent Hollywood 's pressure to shorten the interval between the theatrical first run of a film and its DVD release .
2007_03_15_1833055	28	That interval , known as a window , shrank an average of 10 days last year , to three months and 25 days , according to John Fithian , president of the National Association of Theater Owners .
2007_03_15_1833055	29	Exhibitors are concerned that people wo n't make the trek to the theater if they know the movie will soon show up at the local video store . ''
2007_03_15_1833055	30	What message are we sending to the patron with these short windows ? ''
2007_03_15_1833055	31	he said in his speech on Tuesday to exhibitors , betraying annoyance . ''
2007_03_15_1833055	32	Get the DVD really fast , '' just because the movie stank ?
2007_03_15_1833055	33	he asked , using a more vulgar term .
2007_03_15_1833055	34	He added , '' That part was n't in the script . ''
2007_03_15_1833055	35	Asked later about tension with the studios , he said , '' I would n't say it 's completely dissipated , but it 's certainly improved . ''
2007_03_15_1833055	36	Exhibitors have also not rushed to install digital projectors in their theaters , an expensive process whose cost they are sharing with Hollywood studios .
2007_03_15_1833055	37	After years of discussions with manufacturers , there are now 2,300 screens across the country with digital projectors , still a small fraction of the nation 's 37,000 .
2007_03_15_1833055	38	The higher-quality equipment is not expected to be widely installed until 2009 , when a few high-profile movies in 3D requiring digital projection ( like James Cameron 's '' Avatar '' ) are scheduled for released .
2007_03_15_1833055	39	Screenings and stars have not been completely banished from ShoWest ; the actor Shia LaBeouf came with the director Michael Bay and 20 minutes of their movie , '' Transformers . ''
2007_03_15_1833055	40	But the dream machine has lost some of its dazzle .
2007_03_15_1833055	41	The studios are instead using ShoWest to promote some of their lesser-known releases rather than big-budget spectacles .
2007_03_15_1833055	42	MGM ( now a modest-size distributor ) showed '' Mr. Brooks , '' a psychological thriller with Kevin Costner and Demi Moore ( though it excluded reporters from the screening ) .
2007_03_15_1833055	43	And Paramount screened a small movie , '' Disturbia , '' also starring Mr. LaBeouf . ''
2007_03_15_1833055	44	We have a bunch of movies with a lot of profile , '' said Rob Moore , president of worldwide marketing and distribution at Paramount , explaining the decision not to show the studio 's most anticipated films . ''
2007_03_15_1833055	45	I do n't need to show ` Shrek 3 ' or ` Blades of Glory ' to anybody . ''
2007_03_15_1833059	0	A huge explosion on Wednesday in a hunting supplies store here killed at least six people and wounded nine , and a few hours later a suicide bomber detonated explosives strapped to his chest in a bazaar in the eastern province of Khost , killing five people and wounding 38 , officials said .
2007_03_15_1833059	1	The early morning explosion in Kabul shook the city and turned an outdoor market near the store into a mass of debris .
2007_03_15_1833059	2	Afghan officials said that the explosion appeared to have been an accident and that it had occurred in a place where gunpowder and dynamite were stored .
2007_03_15_1833059	3	Relatives of the store 's owners were digging in the debris on Wednesday to try to find the victims .
2007_03_15_1833059	4	The blast also destroyed more than a dozen other shops and two vehicles .
2007_03_15_1833059	5	The suicide bombing came hours later in the provincial capital , Khost .
2007_03_15_1833059	6	Four civilians and a police officer were killed , and the wounded included nine police officers and two children , said the provincial public health director , Dr. Muhammadin , who , like many Afghans , uses only one name .
2007_03_15_1833059	7	The attack was apparently aimed at a police convoy patrolling the crowded bazaar .
2007_03_15_1833059	8	It was the fourth attack in 24 hours by suspected insurgents in the volatile southern and eastern areas of Afghanistan , where fighters linked to the Taliban are active .
2007_03_15_1833059	9	Two suicide attacks and a roadside bomb killed four people and wounded at least 10 in southern Afghanistan on Tuesday .
2007_03_15_1833059	10	Arsallah Jamal , the governor of Khost Province , blamed '' the enemy of Afghanistan '' for the attack , a term he has used for fighters suspected of being allied with the ousted Taliban government and Al Qaeda . ''
2007_03_15_1833059	11	We want the international community to help us more and pressure our neighboring countries to stand firm on the campaign against international terrorism , '' he said by phone , in a clear reference to Pakistan , where militants are believed to be hiding in the border areas .
2007_03_15_1833060	0	A government-appointed committee examining Israel 's failures during the war in Lebanon last summer says it will publish an interim report in mid - to late April apportioning responsibility to top officials , heightening uncertainty about the future of the beleaguered prime minister , Ehud Olmert , and his government .
2007_03_15_1833060	1	The committee , led by a retired judge , Eliyahu Winograd , announced its intention on Tuesday , saying the report would include '' individual conclusions pertaining to the personal responsibility of the prime minister , the defense minister and the army chief of staff . ''
2007_03_15_1833060	2	That set off a flurry of debate about the possibility that the government would not serve out its term , scheduled to run three more years .
2007_03_15_1833060	3	Lt. Gen. Dan Halutz , the wartime chief of staff , resigned in January .
2007_03_15_1833060	4	In Gaza , after meetings between the Palestinian president , Mahmoud Abbas , of Fatah , and the prime minister , Ismail Haniya , of Hamas , each side said that the new unity government would be unveiled by Thursday and that it would be put to a vote of confidence in the Palestinian parliament on Saturday .
2007_03_15_1833060	5	Palestinian news media reported that the thorny issue of who would be interior minister , a post that controls several security apparatuses , had been resolved .
2007_03_15_1833060	6	Media reports said he is Hani Kawasmi , a civil servant in the Interior Ministry who belongs to neither party .
2007_03_15_1833060	7	Also on Wednesday , Reuters said that a nonbinding report by experts from the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization called on Israel to halt excavations near Jerusalem 's most sacred Islamic site and to proceed only under international supervision .
2007_03_15_1833060	8	The excavations near a religious site holy to both Muslims and Jews set off widespread Muslim protests last month .
2007_03_15_1833060	9	The report says , though , that the excavations for a pedestrian walkway have been done according to professional standards .
2007_03_15_1833060	10	Mark Regev , a spokesman for the Israeli Foreign Ministry , said he had not seen the report but understood that it exonerated Israel from endangering the Muslim holy site . ''
2007_03_15_1833060	11	The report strongly confirms what we have been saying all along -- that what Israel is doing is benign , '' he said .
2007_03_15_1833060	12	If that is the case , he added , '' there 's no reason why we ca n't continue , '' though he left open the possibility of an intensified consultation process .
2007_03_15_1833060	13	The Winograd committee does not have the legal standing of a full state commission of inquiry .
2007_03_15_1833060	14	It will not assess the legal liability of officials under scrutiny or demand their removal .
2007_03_15_1833060	15	But the committee is widely expected to criticize the performance of the top political and military echelons in the 34-day conflict , and has a similar weight to that of a state commission in the eyes of the public . ''
2007_03_15_1833060	16	It is an issue of public accountability , '' said Shlomo Avineri , a professor of political science at Hebrew University of Jerusalem . ''
2007_03_15_1833060	17	If the language is very strong , the criticism will create a dynamic of its own . ''
2007_03_15_1833060	18	The interim report is likely to focus on the army 's preparedness for the war , and the government decision-making process that led to it .
2007_03_15_1833060	19	Questions have also been raised in Israel about whether clear goals were set for the war , and what , if anything , was achieved .
2007_03_15_1833060	20	Several days into the war , Mr. Olmert justified the military campaign in Lebanon that followed the July 12 capture of two Israeli soldiers and the killing of three more in a cross-border raid by Hezbollah , the Lebanese Shiite militant group .
2007_03_15_1833060	21	Hezbollah responded to Israeli retaliation by bombarding northern Israel with rockets . ''
2007_03_15_1833060	22	When missiles are launched at our residents and cities , our answer will be war , '' Mr. Olmert told Parliament on July 17 .
2007_03_15_1833060	23	Israeli news media reported that Mr. Olmert had testified to the Winograd panel that the theoretical decision , after a capture attempt , to respond to any future seizure by Hezbollah with a broad military campaign was made four months before , in March 2006 .
2007_03_15_1833060	24	That account has been challenged by political and military figures who denied knowledge of any early plans .
2007_03_15_1833060	25	The two captured soldiers have not been returned .
2007_03_15_1833060	26	Mr. Olmert leads a solid government coalition with a firm majority in Parliament .
2007_03_15_1833060	27	But he is already operating under investigations of suspicions of improprieties , and his approval ratings are at a record low for an Israeli prime minister .
2007_03_15_1833060	28	The committee 's announcement raised speculation about whether Mr. Olmert 's Kadima Party would unite behind a new leader if he resigned , or split , with some members returning to Likud .
2007_03_15_1833060	29	The Likud leader , Benjamin Netanyahu , apparently hopes that enough members would defect to allow him to form a new governing coalition in a parliamentary move , without early elections .
2007_03_15_1833061	0	A political and legal maelstrom has erupted after Pakistan 's president , Gen. Pervez Musharraf , unceremoniously suspended the country 's chief justice last week , in a step that lawyers and rights activists have called an assault on the independence of the judiciary .
2007_03_15_1833061	1	The suspension of Chief Justice Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry , who did not shy away from taking on cases that challenged the government , has set off immense controversy and threatens to spiral into a constitutional crisis , according to lawyers and analysts here .
2007_03_15_1833061	2	That sense of crisis has deepened as Chief Justice Chaudhry has refused to resign and has vowed to defend himself against unspecified charges before a judicial panel this week .
2007_03_15_1833061	3	General Musharraf has declared the chief justice '' nonfunctional '' until the judicial panel can rule on the charges against him .
2007_03_15_1833061	4	Opponents of the president say that under the Constitution he can not dismiss or suspend him .
2007_03_15_1833061	5	Editorials and op-ed articles in leading newspapers have condemned the action by the president , who also holds the post of army chief .
2007_03_15_1833061	6	Opposition political parties have been equally critical of the government and sided with the top judge .
2007_03_15_1833061	7	Thousands of lawyers across the country have boycotted court proceedings , staged hunger strikes and organized protests .
2007_03_15_1833061	8	A growing wave of public sympathy has swelled behind Chief Justice Chaudhry , whose appearance on Tuesday before the five-member Supreme Judicial Council was accompanied by high drama .
2007_03_15_1833061	9	Hundreds of lawyers gathered outside the Supreme Court to give Chief Justice Chaudhry a hero 's welcome .
2007_03_15_1833061	10	Wearing black arm and head bands , lawyers and activists chanted slogans -- '' Go , Musharraf , go ! ''
2007_03_15_1833061	11	and '' A regime of bullet and baton will not do '' -- in the face of a heavy contingent of police officers .
2007_03_15_1833061	12	Two private television channels were reprimanded by the government and taken off the air for a few minutes after they showed the chief justice trying to march toward the Supreme Court amid a melee between supporters and the police .
2007_03_15_1833061	13	The Supreme Judicial Council adjourned the hearing until Friday .
2007_03_15_1833061	14	The exact charges against the chief justice have not been made public , but there are allegations of misconduct and misuse of authority .
2007_03_15_1833061	15	The chief justice has denied the allegations and called the composition of the judicial panel unconstitutional . ''
2007_03_15_1833061	16	They are absolutely useless allegations , '' a defiant Chief Justice Chaudhry was quoted by the news media here as saying as he entered the Supreme Court . ''
2007_03_15_1833061	17	I am not going to resign . ''
2007_03_15_1833061	18	The chief justice says he has been kept under house arrest since Friday -- something the government denies -- and in a written statement issued to the news media on Tuesday , he said his family was being mistreated and denied basic amenities .
2007_03_15_1833061	19	Many say the charges against him are politically motivated .
2007_03_15_1833061	20	Chief Justice Chaudhry has drawn the ire of the government because '' he began to take the constitutional guarantee of judicial independence too seriously and began to poke the judicial finger into holy waters , '' said Babar Sattar , a lawyer and newspaper columnist based in Islamabad .
2007_03_15_1833061	21	Chief Justice Chaudhry had considerably embarrassed the government by overturning the much-publicized privatization of a steel mill , which tainted Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz for approving the underpriced sale of a major national asset .
2007_03_15_1833061	22	The chief justice also took up cases of '' forced disappearances '' -- people believed to have been picked up by the country 's powerful intelligence agencies without due process of law .
2007_03_15_1833061	23	Human rights groups have expressed concern over the disappearance of at least 400 people in that manner since Pakistan joined the American-led effort to curb terrorism in 2001 .
2007_03_15_1833061	24	In addition , a number of politically charged cases are likely to come before the Supreme Court in the next few months .
2007_03_15_1833061	25	Those cases are expected to include one challenging the legality of General Musharraf 's holding the posts of president and army chief simultaneously and one in which the court is asked to rule on whether the present Parliament can re-elect the general to another term as president .
2007_03_15_1833061	26	Previous public stances taken by Chief Justice Chaudhry implied that the court was unlikely to toe the government line .
2007_03_15_1833061	27	While many here admire his judicial activism and his willingness to take up human rights cases , the chief justice 's gruff style offended many lawyers and government officials .
2007_03_15_1833061	28	An orchestrated vilification campaign was conducted in the news media , questioning his conduct and his desire for protocol and what his critics called excessive pomp and show .
2007_03_15_1833061	29	An open letter addressed to the chief justice by Naeem Bokhari , a flamboyant lawyer and television talk show host , criticized Chief Justice Chaudhry for his style , conduct and alleged nepotism .
2007_03_15_1833061	30	The letter is thought to have been the catalyst for the step taken by General Musharraf .
2007_03_15_1833061	31	Lawyers and human rights activists have condemned what they term a breach of a fundamental principle of law that no one can be condemned unheard . ''
2007_03_15_1833061	32	It is a defining moment , '' said Imran Khan , a onetime famous cricket player turned politician . ''
2007_03_15_1833061	33	The chief justice was supposed to uphold not only the rights of individual citizens but also of institutions and the Constitution .
2007_03_15_1833061	34	When the state can not protect his rights , how can it protect women 's rights or any other individuals ' rights ?
2007_03_15_1833061	35	Ayaz Mir , a leading columnist , said in an interview on Tuesday that the consequences now might be more than the president had anticipated . ''
2007_03_15_1833061	36	I think that Musharraf has lost the script and events are snowballing out of his control , '' Mr. Mir said . ''
2007_03_15_1833061	37	What this entire episode has done is to underline his inability to comprehend the ramifications of events and his growing inability to keep a grip over the government . ''
2007_03_15_1833062	0	The Venerable Maha Ghosananda , a Buddhist monk who led the rebuilding of his religion in Cambodia , calling for peace and reconciliation after the overthrow of the Khmer Rouge in 1979 , died Monday in Northampton , Mass. .
2007_03_15_1833062	1	He was in his late 70s and lived in Providence , R.I. , and Leverett , Mass. .
2007_03_15_1833062	2	The death was confirmed by Christina Trinchero , a spokeswoman for Cooley Dickinson Hospital in Northampton .
2007_03_15_1833062	3	Cambodian monks elected Maha Ghosananda ( his monastic name ) as a supreme Buddhist patriarch in 1988 .
2007_03_15_1833062	4	By then , his efforts to bring solace to a nation in which more than 1.5 million people were starved , worked to death or executed under the Communist dictatorship of Pol Pot had inspired many to call him '' the Cambodian Gandhi . ''
2007_03_15_1833062	5	In his 2002 book '' The Future of Peace : On the Front Lines With the World 's Great Peacemakers , '' Scott A. Hunt , a professor of Buddhism at the University of California , Berkeley , wrote that Maha Ghosananda 's ability to forgive those '' responsible for the murder of his entire family is incomprehensible , '' until one heard his explanation of Buddhism .
2007_03_15_1833062	6	Maha Ghosananda said he '' does not question that loving one 's oppressors -- Cambodians loving the Khmer Rouge -- may be the most difficult attitude to achieve , '' then added , '' But it is the law of the universe that retaliation , hatred and revenge only continue the cycle . ''
2007_03_15_1833062	7	Reconciliation , he continued , '' means that we see ourselves as the opponent ; for what is the opponent but a being in ignorance , and we ourselves are also ignorant of many things . ''
2007_03_15_1833062	8	Somdet Phra Maha Ghosananda was born in Takeo , Cambodia , in 1929 .
2007_03_15_1833062	9	He was initiated into the Cambodian Buddhist Order in 1943 .
2007_03_15_1833062	10	In 1969 , he received a doctorate from Nalanda University in Bihar State , India .
2007_03_15_1833062	11	He was living in a monastery in southern Thailand when a five-year civil war ended in Cambodia in 1976 , with Pol Pot establishing what he called Democratic Kampuchea .
2007_03_15_1833062	12	Within days , almost the entire population of Phnom Penh , the capital , had been marched into the countryside to do forced labor .
2007_03_15_1833062	13	The Khmer Rouge closed about 3,600 Buddhist temples throughout the country .
2007_03_15_1833062	14	By the time Vietnamese forces overthrew the regime 44 months later , only about 3,000 of Cambodia 's 60,000 Buddhist priests were still alive .
2007_03_15_1833062	15	By then , Maha Ghosananda had already trekked from one refugee camp to another along the border with Thailand , establishing Buddhist temples and training new monks .
2007_03_15_1833062	16	He continued that work throughout the country after the ouster of Pol Pot .
2007_03_15_1833062	17	Maha Ghosananda moved to Massachusetts in the late 1980s at the invitation of a Buddhist order in Leverett .
2007_03_15_1833062	18	But in 1991 he returned to Cambodia to lead a 16-day pilgrimage across the country -- gathering followers from village after village -- in the first of what became known as the Dhammayietra Walks for Peace and Reconciliation .
2007_03_15_1833062	19	In 1998 , the Niwano Peace Foundation of Japan awarded Maha Ghosananda its peace prize , saying in its citation that '' through these walks , Maha Ghosananda became a bridge of peace -- bringing together people who had been separated by war -- and wiped away their fears with his call for peace . ''
2007_03_15_1833062	20	Pointing out that Maha Ghosananda had promoted nonviolence as a remedy for other causes , including deforestation and the use of land mines , the foundation also said , '' In both spirit and deed , he has shown the way to a fundamental resolution of regional and ethnic strife around the world . ''
2007_03_15_1833063	0	Barbara Gittings , a prominent gay rights activist who a decade before the Stonewall rebellion of 1969 was agitating for the rights of lesbians and gay men , died on Feb. 18 at her home in Kennett Square , Pa. .
2007_03_15_1833063	1	The cause was breast cancer , said her partner , Kay Tobin Lahusen .
2007_03_15_1833063	2	At a time when few gay men and women dared come out in private , much less in public , Ms. Gittings was a vocal -- and highly visible -- figure in the fledgling gay rights movement .
2007_03_15_1833063	3	In the late 1950s , she founded the New York chapter of the Daughters of Bilitis , the first national organization for lesbians .
2007_03_15_1833063	4	In the 1960s , she took part in early gay rights demonstrations at the White House and elsewhere .
2007_03_15_1833063	5	In the early 1970s , she helped lobby the American Psychiatric Association to change its stance on homosexuality ; in 1973 , the association rescinded its definition of homosexuality as a mental disorder . ''
2007_03_15_1833063	6	She was one of the rare people in the homophile movement -- before Stonewall -- who took a militant stance , '' David Carter , the author of '' Stonewall : The Riots That Sparked the Gay Revolution '' ( St. Martin 's , 2004 ) , said in a telephone interview . ''
2007_03_15_1833063	7	And she not only took a militant stance , but she was in the forefront . ''
2007_03_15_1833063	8	Ms. Gittings also worked to make information about gay men and lesbians more widely available in libraries .
2007_03_15_1833063	9	Though not a librarian by training , she was for many years the head of the American Library Association 's Gay Task Force .
2007_03_15_1833063	10	( It is known today as the Gay , Lesbian , Bisexual and Transgendered Round Table . )
2007_03_15_1833063	11	In that capacity , she oversaw and edited the association 's comprehensive bibliography of literature by and about gay men and lesbians .
2007_03_15_1833063	12	As Ms. Gittings often said in interviews , she became keenly aware of the need for such a bibliography as a young woman , when she scoured local libraries , seeking , but seldom finding , something that would help her understand her own life .
2007_03_15_1833063	13	Barbara Gittings was born on July 31 , 1932 , in Vienna , where her father was a member of the United States diplomatic corps .
2007_03_15_1833063	14	Returning to the United States when Barbara was young , the family eventually settled in Wilmington , Del. .
2007_03_15_1833063	15	When she was a teenager , her father caught her reading '' The Well of Loneliness , '' the 1928 novel of lesbian love by the English writer Radclyffe Hall .
2007_03_15_1833063	16	He told her to burn the book .
2007_03_15_1833063	17	He did so by letter , for he could not bring himself to speak to her .
2007_03_15_1833063	18	Ms. Gittings entered Northwestern University , intending to study drama .
2007_03_15_1833063	19	But she was increasingly distracted by the need to learn as much as she could about homosexuality .
2007_03_15_1833063	20	She haunted the libraries of Chicago , unearthing little that was relevant and less that was encouraging . ''
2007_03_15_1833063	21	I had to find bits and pieces under headings like ` sexual perversion ' and ` sexual aberration ' in books on abnormal psychology , '' Ms. Gittings told the publication American Libraries in 1999 . ''
2007_03_15_1833063	22	I kept thinking , ` It 's me they 're writing about , but it does n't feel like me at all . ' ''
2007_03_15_1833063	23	She left Northwestern after her freshman year , and throughout her decades of activism supported herself with clerical jobs .
2007_03_15_1833063	24	In 1958 , commuting from her home in Philadelphia , Ms. Gittings started the New York chapter of the Daughters of Bilitis , which was founded in San Francisco in 1955 ; she later edited the organization 's national newsletter , The Ladder .
2007_03_15_1833063	25	In 1965 , she took part in one of the first gay rights pickets of the White House , an effort to end discrimination against gay men and lesbians in federal employment .
2007_03_15_1833063	26	Ms. Gittings received many awards , among them honorary membership in the American Library Association .
2007_03_15_1833063	27	The Free Library of Philadelphia named its gay and lesbian collection for her .
2007_03_15_1833063	28	This week , the New York Public Library acquired the papers of Ms. Gittings and Ms. Lahusen , which chronicle more than half a century in the gay rights movement .
2007_03_15_1833063	29	Besides Ms. Lahusen , her companion of 46 years , Ms. Gittings is survived by a sister , Eleanor Gittings Taylor of San Diego .
2007_03_15_1833063	30	With Ms. Lahusen , Ms. Gittings lived for many years in Philadelphia and Wilmington before moving to Kennett Square in January . ''
2007_03_15_1833063	31	Before Barbara died , we went jointly into an assisted-living facility here , '' Ms. Lahusen said by telephone . ''
2007_03_15_1833063	32	Our last bit of activism was to come out in the newsletter of our assisted-living facility . ''
2007_03_15_1833064	0	F. Clark Howell , credited with transforming the study of human origins from just '' stones and bones '' to a broader discipline drawing on biology , ecology , geology and primatology , died on Saturday at his home in Berkeley , Calif. .
2007_03_15_1833064	1	The death was announced yesterday by the University of California , Berkeley , where he was a professor emeritus of anthropology .
2007_03_15_1833064	2	Dr. Howell learned last year that he had cancer , the announcement said .
2007_03_15_1833064	3	Rising to prominence 50 years ago , as the science of human origins made the first in a succession of discoveries in Africa , Dr. Howell worked with Louis and Mary Leakey and then their son , Richard .
2007_03_15_1833064	4	The Leakeys established East Africa as the likely nursery of human evolution .
2007_03_15_1833064	5	Dr. Howell led or participated in fossil-hunting excavations around the world , in Turkey , Spain and China , as well as Ethiopia , Kenya , South Africa and Tanzania .
2007_03_15_1833064	6	It was as leader of an Omo Basin expedition in southern Ethiopia from 1968 to 1973 , colleagues say , that he established the multidisciplinary approach to modern paleoanthropology , the science of early human origins . ''
2007_03_15_1833064	7	When you look at a modern project , whether in Tanzania or South Africa or Ethiopia , you find Clark 's stamp everywhere , '' said Tim D. White , a Berkeley professor of integrative biology and successful hunter of early human fossils . ''
2007_03_15_1833064	8	He personified modern paleoanthropology . ''
2007_03_15_1833064	9	By that , Dr. White said he meant that Dr. Howell 's research was not confined by geography or constricted by academic specialties . ''
2007_03_15_1833064	10	He was as much a Paleolithic archaeologist interested in prehistory as a physical anthropologist interested in anatomy , '' Dr. White said . ''
2007_03_15_1833064	11	He integrated the physical , biological and behavioral sciences . ''
2007_03_15_1833064	12	Dr. White was co-director with Dr. Howell of the Human Evolution Research Center , which Dr. Howell founded at the university in 1970 .
2007_03_15_1833064	13	After retiring as a professor in 1991 , Dr. Howell joined excavations in Spain and Turkey and returned to Ethiopia with Dr. White for fossil studies related to the recent discovery of a new hominid genus and species , Ardipithecus ramidus .
2007_03_15_1833064	14	Colleagues said this research in the Middle Awash Valley was notable on two counts .
2007_03_15_1833064	15	It appeared to extend the trail of human ancestors back nearly six million years , almost twice as early as the hominid species , Australopithecus afarensis , commonly known as Lucy .
2007_03_15_1833064	16	In addition , Dr. Howell trained many Africans on the discovery team .
2007_03_15_1833064	17	One of them , Giday WoldeGabriel of Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico , said Dr. Howell '' was a genuine advocate for the advancement of Africans '' as full participants in fossil-hunting projects .
2007_03_15_1833064	18	As a founder and trustee of the Leakey Foundation , officials of the organization said , Dr. Howell had a wide influence on the field by steering research grants to young scientists engaged in new directions of scholarship .
2007_03_15_1833064	19	Likewise , he had earlier provided financial backing at a crucial stage in the work of Jane Goodall on chimpanzees and other projects on orangutans and gorillas and studies of modern human hunter-gatherers .
2007_03_15_1833064	20	Don Dana , vice president of the Leakey Foundation board , praised Dr. Howell as '' the one who took paleoanthropology from a fossil-recovery type of science to a science where we had to understand the geology , the flora and fauna , the chemistry , everything . ''
2007_03_15_1833064	21	Francis Clark Howell was born on Nov. 27 , 1925 , in Kansas City , Mo. .
2007_03_15_1833064	22	He served in the Navy in World War II and then entered the University of Chicago to study anthropology .
2007_03_15_1833064	23	He graduated in 1949 and received his doctorate in 1953 .
2007_03_15_1833064	24	After two years as an anatomy instructor at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis , he joined the faculty at Chicago as a physical anthropologist , becoming a full professor in 1962 .
2007_03_15_1833064	25	He moved to Berkeley in 1970 .
2007_03_15_1833064	26	Surviving are his wife , Betty Ann Howell of Berkeley ; a son , Brian David Howell of Berkeley ; a daughter , Jennifer Clare Howell , and a granddaughter , Alisa Howell-Smith , of McMinnville , Ore. ; and two sisters , Margaret Johnson and Elizabeth Howell of Charlotte , N.C. .
2007_03_15_1833064	27	In addition to his many scholarly publications , Dr. Howell wrote a popular book , '' Early Man , '' an entry in the Time-Life Nature Library series in 1965 .
2007_03_15_1833064	28	The book sparked the interest of Tim White , then a teenager , in anthropology , eventually leading to his close scientific collaboration with the author .
2007_03_15_1833065	0	The New York City Council passed a bill yesterday to ban the use of metal bats in high school baseball games , securing enough votes to override a potential veto by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg .
2007_03_15_1833065	1	The vote set up a possible legal challenge from the metal-bat industry .
2007_03_15_1833065	2	Industry officials , who opposed the bill , said they believed that the Council was the first legislative body in the nation to pass such a measure .
2007_03_15_1833065	3	The vote was a long-sought victory for the bill 's original sponsor , James S. Oddo , a Staten Island Republican , who began pushing for a ban more than six years ago against intense opposition led by bat manufacturers .
2007_03_15_1833065	4	He had originally sought to include Little League and independent leagues in the ban .
2007_03_15_1833065	5	He later narrowed his bill to draw broader Council support . ''
2007_03_15_1833065	6	I know this is not the most pressing issue on the minds of New Yorkers , '' he said shortly before the vote , '' but I really believe in this bill .
2007_03_15_1833065	7	There is risk in all sports , and there is risk in baseball playing with a wooden bat , but when the risk becomes unreasonable , people have to act . ''
2007_03_15_1833065	8	The City Council speaker , Christine C. Quinn , who rallied support for the measure among council members , said , '' We think this is an appropriate safety step for us to protect our high school athletes . ''
2007_03_15_1833065	9	The bill passed 40-6 with two abstentions .
2007_03_15_1833065	10	Two-thirds of the 51 members on the Council , or 34 votes , are needed to override a veto .
2007_03_15_1833065	11	Speaking before yesterday 's vote , Mayor Bloomberg declined to say whether he would veto the legislation . ''
2007_03_15_1833065	12	I have been called by professional baseball players , who are friends of mine , on both sides of the issue , '' Mr. Bloomberg said . ''
2007_03_15_1833065	13	I 'll look at the data and try to decide whether or not it 's an appropriate thing for the city to do , to get involved , and if so , what the science says . ''
2007_03_15_1833065	14	The use of aluminum bats , which were first introduced in the early 1970s , has been debated for years both from a competitive standpoint and increasingly for safety reasons .
2007_03_15_1833065	15	Critics of the bats say balls fly off them faster , giving pitchers less time to react .
2007_03_15_1833065	16	In 2003 , for instance , Brandon Patch , an 18-year-old American Legion pitcher in Montana , was killed when a line drive off a metal bat smashed into his left temple .
2007_03_15_1833065	17	His mother and uncle supported the bill .
2007_03_15_1833065	18	But industry officials say there have been no reliable studies showing that metal bats pose greater risk of injury than wooden bats .
2007_03_15_1833065	19	A number of coaches , leagues and athletic organizations , including Little League International and the New York Catholic High Schools Athletic Association , opposed the bill . ''
2007_03_15_1833065	20	This is not a safety issue , '' said Jim Darby , a spokesman for Easton Sports , a leading bat maker based in Van Nuys , Calif. .
2007_03_15_1833065	21	He added that his company and the industry would '' look at all the different options out there '' to block the legislation , including possible legal action .
2007_03_15_1833065	22	In voting against the bill , Councilman Tony Avella of Queens said , '' As much as this is an emotional and sensitive issue , sometimes you have to have facts , and the statistics are just not there . ''
2007_03_15_1833065	23	Councilman Peter F. Vallone Jr. of Queens responded by calling the ban '' common sense . '' ''
2007_03_15_1833065	24	Anyone who has been on a ball field knows aluminum bats hit harder , '' he said .
2007_03_15_1833065	25	In other City Hall actions yesterday , the mayor postponed signing a bill to regulate the city 's growing pedicab industry .
2007_03_15_1833065	26	The bill limits the number of pedicabs to 325 , down from what industry representatives estimate is now 500 .
2007_03_15_1833065	27	It would also require drivers to post their rates , force owners to carry liability insurance and ban the small electric motors that some riders use to provide a boost for tired legs .
2007_03_15_1833065	28	The pedicab industry said the bill threatened its drivers ' livelihood .
2007_03_15_1833065	29	Several people raised those concerns at a public hearing before the planned signing , causing the mayor to delay it . ''
2007_03_15_1833065	30	The mayor listened , and in light of the concerns he heard , he decided that since he has more time to act , he 'll take advantage of that , '' said Stu Loeser , the mayor 's spokesman .
2007_03_15_1833065	31	The mayor has until March 30 to act on the bill , Mr. Loeser said .
2007_03_15_1833065	32	The mayor did sign several other bills into law yesterday , including three measures intended to make nightclubs safer .
2007_03_15_1833065	33	One requires certain cabarets and dance halls to install video surveillance cameras at entrances and exits .
2007_03_15_1833065	34	Another requires clubs with multiple violations to hire independent monitors at the clubs ' expense to help them comply .
2007_03_15_1833065	35	The third bill allows the city to use nuisance abatement laws to shut down businesses that sell fake identifications to minors .
2007_03_15_1833065	36	The Council , meanwhile , passed a pair of bills requiring business owners to provide helmets and safety equipment to employees who use bicycles as part of their work and to post bicycle safety rules and guidelines .
2007_03_15_1833065	37	Another bill that passed would put into law the city regulation adopted by the Board of Health in December that bans trans fats in restaurant cooking .
2007_03_15_1833065	38	Mr. Vallone , the bill 's sponsor , said putting the ban in the city 's legal code would make it harder for future administrations to overturn it .
2007_03_15_1833068	0	Almost 40 years ago , when Irene Marsh was a young woman , she took a few months of computer science courses .
2007_03_15_1833068	1	But when Ms. Marsh realized that would not help her find a job in this Appalachian furniture region , she dropped out and went to work in a factory making tabletops .
2007_03_15_1833068	2	Then , like thousands of other furniture makers here in the last five years , she lost her job to workers overseas , after 37 years at one company .
2007_03_15_1833068	3	But Ms. Marsh , who recently sat with a mouse and keyboard in a basic-skills classroom at Caldwell Community College a few miles south of here , may yet have her chance at a computer job .
2007_03_15_1833068	4	Last month , the Internet search giant Google announced that it would take advantage of the area 's underused electric power grid , cheap land and robust water supply to build a '' server farm '' -- a building full of computers that will become part of the company 's worldwide network .
2007_03_15_1833068	5	Google says it hopes laid-off furniture workers , most of whom never graduated from high school , will be among the 250 employees at two facilities on the 215-acre site , much of which was once a lumberyard .
2007_03_15_1833068	6	Ms. Marsh , 58 , intends to apply . ''
2007_03_15_1833068	7	Of course , you know , it 's come a long way , '' she said cheerfully . ''
2007_03_15_1833068	8	Back then you used to have punch cards and all that .
2007_03_15_1833068	9	They needed a whole room for one big gigantic computer . ''
2007_03_15_1833068	10	That Google chose Lenoir , a town that still uses some 18th-century techniques to make its signature products , may seem odd : Server farms require relatively little human labor , and they do not produce anything , not even baby computers .
2007_03_15_1833068	11	But the choice of Lenoir , in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains , bodes well for other struggling manufacturing economies in the South , as Google is already considering two sites in South Carolina for similar facilities .
2007_03_15_1833068	12	Google will not reveal how many server farms it has or intends to build , but they are important components in its race to stay ahead of competitors like Microsoft and Yahoo .
2007_03_15_1833068	13	Since the deal in Lenoir ( pronounced leh-NORE ) was announced in February , city and county officials have found themselves on the defensive , criticized for the secrecy of the negotiations and the package of incentives , potentially worth $ 260 million , that Google will receive .
2007_03_15_1833068	14	At Google 's request , the state legislature passed a law exempting some high-tech businesses from paying sales tax on electricity -- a tax the company says it would not pay in many other states .
2007_03_15_1833068	15	And as long as the server farm is operational , the city and county will forgive 100 percent of the company 's personal property taxes and 80 percent of its real estate taxes for up to 30 years .
2007_03_15_1833068	16	The deal 's critics point out that although Google said it would invest $ 600 million and create 250 jobs at an average salary of $ 48,000 , it made no minimum guarantees , often considered an important part of shielding economic development deals from accusations that they are corporate giveaways .
2007_03_15_1833068	17	The incentive package is one of the largest ever in the state , and when it is broken down per job , it is as much as $ 1.24 million each . ''
2007_03_15_1833068	18	I agree that jobs are what we need , '' said T. J. Rohr , the only city councilman to vote against the incentives ( on principle , he said ; he is a Libertarian ) . ''
2007_03_15_1833068	19	But what 's the limit that you 're willing to pay for a job ? ''
2007_03_15_1833068	20	Local officials argue that the company will pay hundreds of thousands in franchise fees , sales taxes and payroll taxes and that it has filled local hotels with construction workers , bought tons of stone and concrete and hired security guards .
2007_03_15_1833068	21	Since the deal was announced , a former Winn-Dixie store , on the market for more than a year , has sold , and the town mall is under contract , officials said . ''
2007_03_15_1833068	22	Here 's what I 've asked people , too : What 's the disadvantage ? ''
2007_03_15_1833068	23	said David Barlow , the mayor . ''
2007_03_15_1833068	24	What if they were n't coming ?
2007_03_15_1833068	25	Then we 'd have 100 percent of nothing . ''
2007_03_15_1833068	26	Most of the criticism has come not from locals but from the state 's two biggest newspapers , The Charlotte Observer and The News & Observer of Raleigh , which have , among other things , questioned the secrecy employed in negotiating the deal .
2007_03_15_1833068	27	At times , things have gotten personal . ''
2007_03_15_1833068	28	God bless them if they can learn how to run a server farm , '' a Charlotte Observer columnist wrote of Lenoir 's work force . ''
2007_03_15_1833068	29	A lot of folks in Charlotte and Atlanta and D.C. already know how . ''
2007_03_15_1833068	30	Tim Sanders , a county commissioner during the bulk of the negotiations , said officials simply researched competing sites and tried to make a better offer .
2007_03_15_1833068	31	He said Google had already paid $ 4 million to the city and county to offset some infrastructure costs , while the local governments have lost nothing . ''
2007_03_15_1833068	32	We 're being criticized like we 're a bunch of country hicks out here and we ca n't count , '' Mr. Sanders said .
2007_03_15_1833068	33	Mr. Barlow and Mr. Sanders considered the deal so important that they went door to door to ask some 35 homeowners to sell their land to amass a tract of the size Google wanted to buy . ''
2007_03_15_1833068	34	I dreaded living here if Google did not choose that site , '' Mr. Barlow said .
2007_03_15_1833068	35	Still , local residents have wondered how many of them will be qualified for the jobs Google has to offer .
2007_03_15_1833068	36	( The company says contractors will employ landscapers , janitors and security workers in addition to the 250 jobs . )
2007_03_15_1833068	37	Kyle Kiziak , 22 , who works for a welding supply company , said his stepfather was recently laid off from his job as a truck driver . ''
2007_03_15_1833068	38	He sits there and thinks , ` Will they hire someone like me ? ' ''
2007_03_15_1833068	39	Lloyd Taylor , Google 's director of global operations , said there was a false assumption that the data center would have '' a team of rocket scientists holed up in a room . ''
2007_03_15_1833068	40	Many of the company 's computers , he said , can self-diagnose problems and be repaired by trained workers .
2007_03_15_1833068	41	Google is already helping the community college develop a technology training program .
2007_03_15_1833068	42	And , he said , the company believes that furniture makers have '' a great work ethic . ''
2007_03_15_1833068	43	The need for jobs , economic diversification and good news is dire .
2007_03_15_1833068	44	Lenoir 's furniture industry has been decimated by overseas competition , and the transformation has been swift .
2007_03_15_1833068	45	The unemployment rate went from one of the state 's lowest , 2.4 percent , in 2000 , to 6.9 percent last year , after peaking at 9.8 percent in 2003 .
2007_03_15_1833068	46	Some 5,000 furniture jobs have been lost .
2007_03_15_1833068	47	Many workers in their 40s and 50s , who raised families and paid mortgages on factory salaries , have had to go back to school .
2007_03_15_1833068	48	G. Alex Bernhardt Sr. , chairman and chief executive of the Bernhardt Furniture Company , said the industry had collapsed so quickly because a depression after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks coincided with a substantial increase in China 's capacity to handle furniture manufacturing jobs , leading to a series of difficult announcements to Lenoir 's workers . ''
2007_03_15_1833068	49	I usually say to them , ' I shop at Wal-Mart , I think most of you shop at Wal-Mart -- we ca n't have it both ways , ' '' Mr. Bernhardt said during an interview in his office .
2007_03_15_1833068	50	Even though his company is a major taxpayer that does not get the same breaks promised to Google , Mr. Bernhardt said , he is enthusiastic about the center . ''
2007_03_15_1833068	51	They 're bringing something new and fresh to the community that we need , '' he said . ''
2007_03_15_1833068	52	People who have to pay for those incentives , like Bernhardt , are not complaining about it . ''
2007_03_15_1833068	53	Then Mr. Bernhardt began to muse about the county 's transition from agrarian to industrial and now , he hopes , to a knowledge-based economy . ''
2007_03_15_1833068	54	My grandfather started the first furniture factory in Lenoir , '' he said . ''
2007_03_15_1833068	55	I wonder how long that took them , '' he said . ''
2007_03_15_1833068	56	It certainly did n't take only five years . ''
2007_03_15_1833068	57	Correction : March 19 , 2007 , Monday An article on Thursday about plans by the Internet search giant Google to build two facilities in Lenoir , N.C. , misstated the month it announced the decision .
2007_03_15_1833068	58	It was January , not February .
2007_03_15_1833069	0	Federal appellate judges here ruled Wednesday that a terminally ill woman using marijuana was not immune to federal prosecution simply because of her condition , and in a separate case a federal judge dismissed most of the charges against a prominent advocate for the medicinal use of the drug .
2007_03_15_1833069	1	The woman , Angel McClary Raich , says she uses marijuana on doctors ' recommendation to treat an inoperable brain tumor and a battery of other serious ailments .
2007_03_15_1833069	2	Ms. Raich , 41 , asserts that the drug effectively keeps her alive , by stimulating appetite and relieving pain , in a way that prescription drugs do not .
2007_03_15_1833069	3	She wept when she heard the decision . ''
2007_03_15_1833069	4	It 's not every day in this country that someone 's right to life is taken from them , '' said Ms. Raich , appearing frail during a news conference in Oakland , where she lives . ''
2007_03_15_1833069	5	Today you are looking at someone who really is walking dead . ''
2007_03_15_1833069	6	In 2002 , she and three other plaintiffs sued the government , seeking relief from federal laws outlawing marijuana .
2007_03_15_1833069	7	The case made its way to the Supreme Court , and in 2005 , the court ruled against Ms. Raich , finding that the federal government had the authority to prohibit and prosecute the possession and use of marijuana for medical purposes .
2007_03_15_1833069	8	But the justices left elements of Ms. Raich 's case to a lower court to consider .
2007_03_15_1833069	9	On Wednesday , a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit found that while they sympathized with Ms. Raich 's plight and had seen '' uncontroverted evidence '' that she needed marijuana to survive , she lacked the legal grounds to exempt herself from federal law .
2007_03_15_1833069	10	The court '' recognizes the use of marijuana for medical purposes is gaining traction , '' the decision read . ''
2007_03_15_1833069	11	But that legal recognition has not yet reached the point where a conclusion can be drawn that the right to use medical marijuana is ` fundamental . ' ''
2007_03_15_1833069	12	Eleven states have medical marijuana laws on the books , and the New Mexico Legislature is poised to approve a medical marijuana bill there , with the support of Gov. Bill Richardson .
2007_03_15_1833069	13	Medical-marijuana advocates estimate more than 100,000 Americans use the drug to treat medical conditions .
2007_03_15_1833069	14	California was the first state to legalize medical marijuana , in a 1996 ballot measure , Proposition 215 .
2007_03_15_1833069	15	That measure set off a decade-long fight over a variety of legal issues surrounding marijuana , including state rights and '' common law necessity '' defenses like the one Ms. Raich was trying to use .
2007_03_15_1833069	16	Graham Boyd , director of the Drug Law Reform Project of the American Civil Liberties Union , which has an unrelated medical marijuana case pending before a federal judge in San Jose , said the decision in Ms. Raich 's case was a setback for the movement but not a crippling one . ''
2007_03_15_1833069	17	Today is just one chapter in a story that is still not over , '' Mr. Boyd said Robert Raich , Ms. Raich 's husband and lawyer , said she might appeal the case to the full Ninth Circuit .
2007_03_15_1833069	18	In the other ruling on Wednesday , a judge in United States District Court here handed a victory to the marijuana advocate , Ed Rosenthal .
2007_03_15_1833069	19	Mr. Rosenthal , 62 , said federal prosecutors had unfairly made him a target with an array of drug , money-laundering and tax-evasion charges , many of which closely mirrored charges he was convicted of in 2003 , when he was growing medical marijuana under California 's law at a dispensary in Oakland .
2007_03_15_1833069	20	That conviction was overturned last year by a federal appeals court , which found evidence of jury misconduct .
2007_03_15_1833069	21	Mr. Rosenthal had asked the judge , Charles R. Breyer , for a dismissal at a hearing this month , suggesting that the prosecution was vindictive .
2007_03_15_1833069	22	On Wednesday , Mr. Breyer obliged in part , dismissing the charges of money laundering and tax evasion , but leaving the marijuana charges in place .
2007_03_15_1833069	23	And while Mr. Breyer said that he believed the prosecutors had acted in good faith , that nonetheless '' the presumption of vindictiveness has not been rebutted . ''
2007_03_15_1833069	24	Joseph Elford , a lawyer for Mr. Rosenthal , said the case had been '' a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources . ''
2007_03_15_1833070	0	Struggling with a restive Labor Party in his final months of power , Prime Minister Tony Blair faced down a significant mutiny in Parliament on Wednesday , winning a vote to renew Britain 's nuclear deterrent only with the support of opposition lawmakers .
2007_03_15_1833070	1	But the vote raised a broader issue for some in Parliament , and outside , who questioned how Britain could press for nuclear nonproliferation , particularly in Iran and North Korea , if it was planning to spend $ 40 billion to create a new generation of nuclear submarines to carry American-supplied Trident missiles .
2007_03_15_1833070	2	Before the vote , three lawmakers who are low-ranking ministerial aides from the Labor Party quit their jobs to protest the renewal and one of them , Nigel Griffiths , said , '' We must lead the world in campaigning for the eradication of the nuclear threat and we must lead by example . ''
2007_03_15_1833070	3	About 90 Labor legislators -- a quarter of Labor 's lawmakers -- rebelled against the government 's plan to renew the submarine program .
2007_03_15_1833070	4	Speaking in Parliament before the vote , Mr. Blair said , '' I believe it is important that we recognize that although it is impossible to predict the future , the one thing that is certain is the uncertainty of it . '' ''
2007_03_15_1833070	5	For that reason , I think it is sensible we take this decision today , '' he added .
2007_03_15_1833070	6	He contended that Britain would undermine its ability to press for disarmament if it scrapped its nuclear arsenal -- the smallest among the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council . ''
2007_03_15_1833070	7	There is absolutely no evidence whatever that if Britain now renounced its independent nuclear deterrent that would improve the prospects of getting multilateral disarmament , '' he said . ''
2007_03_15_1833070	8	I think the reverse is the case . ''
2007_03_15_1833070	9	Traditionally , Labor has displayed a deep vein of antiwar and antinuclear sentiment and was formally committed to unilateral nuclear disarmament for many years .
2007_03_15_1833070	10	Hundreds of people protested outside Parliament as lawmakers voted .
2007_03_15_1833070	11	On the London subway on Wednesday , antinuclear protesters handed out leaflets while wearing T-shirts proclaiming , '' Tony loves W.M.D. , '' the initials for weapons of mass destruction .
2007_03_15_1833070	12	Some church leaders joined a demonstration at a naval base in Scotland , where the Vanguard-class submarines that carry the nuclear missiles are based . ''
2007_03_15_1833070	13	In my judgment the U.K. 's continued possession of nuclear weapons is no longer simply maintaining the ` balance of terror , ' but fueling the development of new nuclear weapons systems around the world , '' Patrick O'Donoghue , the Roman Catholic bishop of Lancaster , said in a statement .
2007_03_15_1833070	14	The foreign secretary , Margaret Beckett , told lawmakers before Wednesday 's vote that Britain would cut its arsenal of nuclear weapons by 20 percent this year , to fewer than 160 , which would be a 75 percent reduction since the end of the cold war .
2007_03_15_1833070	15	Britain 's four Vanguard-class submarines each carry 16 American-supplied Trident long-range missiles with British nuclear warheads .
2007_03_15_1833070	16	They are supposed to maintain permanent patrols around the globe .
2007_03_15_1833070	17	Both Mr. Blair and his likely successor , Gordon Brown , say Britain should embark on building a second generation of submarines because the present vessels will go out of service by 2024 and it will take 17 years to design and build replacements .
2007_03_15_1833070	18	The Labor Party has a majority of over 60 among the 646 members of the lower House of Commons .
2007_03_15_1833070	19	Mr. Blair has faced rebellions in the past , notably among the nearly 140 Labor lawmakers who opposed the invasion of Iraq .
2007_03_15_1833070	20	He won that vote in March 2003 , when the opposition Conservatives voted in favor of the invasion .
2007_03_15_1833070	21	But he lost a vote on an antiterrorism measure in November 2005 -- the first such defeat since Labor won power in 1997 .
2007_03_15_1833070	22	In Wednesday 's ballot , legislators cast votes for two measures .
2007_03_15_1833070	23	The first , which the government opposed , said that there was no need yet to decide on the renewal of the nuclear deterrent .
2007_03_15_1833070	24	Mr. Blair won defeat of that motion , 413 to 167 , with others absent or abstaining , meaning that roughly 90 Labor legislators had broken ranks with his party , some had abstained and many of the almost 200 Conservatives had voted with Labor .
2007_03_15_1833070	25	The second was a straight vote on whether the nuclear submarine fleet should be renewed .
2007_03_15_1833070	26	Mr. Blair won that vote by 409 to 161 , with a rebellion of around 85 Labor legislators .
2007_03_15_1833070	27	Earlier the Conservative opposition leader , David Cameron , pledged to support the government in renewing the submarine program -- a policy the Conservatives have long supported .
2007_03_15_1833070	28	By depicting Mr. Blair as reliant on Conservatives , the opposition seeks to highlight what it calls weakness on the part of Mr. Blair .
2007_03_15_1833071	0	The police fired on protesters in eastern India early Wednesday , killing at least 11 people at a demonstration against one of the new Chinese-style economic zones .
2007_03_15_1833071	1	The violence erupted when the police tried to enter Nandigram , a rural area in West Bengal State , where the Salim Group of Indonesia has proposed building a vast chemical hub .
2007_03_15_1833071	2	Protesters had blockaded the area for several weeks , and it was effectively off limits to state law enforcement .
2007_03_15_1833071	3	The Nandigram strife has become a parable of a larger debate roiling India over whether and how the government acquires agricultural land and hands it over for industrial development .
2007_03_15_1833071	4	The central government announced in January that it would temporarily suspend the approval of new zones and review rules for acquiring land and compensating landowners and farmers .
2007_03_15_1833071	5	The Special Economic Zones at issue are especially attractive to companies because they offer long-term tax breaks .
2007_03_15_1833071	6	Applications are pending in India for zones devoted to development as varied as technology companies and power plants .
2007_03_15_1833071	7	Roughly two-thirds of Indians rely on agriculture for their livelihood , and farmland conversion is an emotional and politically charged issue .
2007_03_15_1833071	8	West Bengal , which is governed by the Communist Party of India ( Marxist ) , has emerged as the center of that debate .
2007_03_15_1833071	9	The state 's government has faced protests in another area , Singur , over converting nearly 1,000 acres of agricultural land into an automobile factory .
2007_03_15_1833071	10	Last year , 11 people were killed in protests over the building of a steel plant in another eastern state , Orissa .
2007_03_15_1833072	0	The clashes were the bloody culmination of routine , if risky , police work : One officer was shot in a Harlem restaurant on Tuesday night , and another was stabbed in the head in a Brooklyn subway station about 90 minutes later .
2007_03_15_1833072	1	In each case , officers approached men they considered suspicious and tried to frisk them for weapons .
2007_03_15_1833072	2	In Harlem , Robert Tejada , 35 , an officer in plain clothes , was shot twice by a man he and three other officers in plain clothes had followed into a small restaurant , Cafe 22 , on Adam Clayton Powell Jr. .
2007_03_15_1833072	3	Boulevard near 136th Street , the police said .
2007_03_15_1833072	4	The suspect , Corey Mickins , 25 , fought back when the officers found that he was carrying a 9-millimeter pistol , the police said .
2007_03_15_1833072	5	Officer Tejada , who was wearing a bullet-resistant vest , was in stable condition yesterday at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia hospital , the police said .
2007_03_15_1833072	6	Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said he probably would not have survived without the vest .
2007_03_15_1833072	7	Mr. Mickins , whose criminal record included an attempted murder charge , was fatally shot by the other officers .
2007_03_15_1833072	8	The police said yesterday that the four officers clearly identified themselves before approaching Mr. Mickins .
2007_03_15_1833072	9	About 90 minutes later in Brooklyn , Angel Cruz , 30 , a transit officer , was alone when he encountered two men smoking cigarettes on a platform of the Broadway Junction subway station in East New York .
2007_03_15_1833072	10	Officer Cruz ordered both men upstairs to a mezzanine area of the station , where he intended to issue them summonses for smoking , the police said .
2007_03_15_1833072	11	The officer also asked the men if they were armed , the police said .
2007_03_15_1833072	12	One man cooperated and turned over a Swiss Army knife , but the other man , identified as Hugo Hernandez , 22 , became belligerent and punched Officer Cruz when he tried to frisk him , said Paul J. Browne , a police spokesman .
2007_03_15_1833072	13	Mr. Hernandez 's companion rushed out of the station and was not involved or charged in what escalated into a life-and-death struggle between Officer Cruz and Mr. Hernandez that sent both to hospitals .
2007_03_15_1833072	14	Mr. Browne described a fierce struggle : Officer Cruz tried to subdue Mr. Hernandez , who pulled out a six-inch hunting knife and slashed the officer over his left ear .
2007_03_15_1833072	15	Officer Cruz staggered backward and fell to the ground near a pay phone while Mr. Hernandez threatened him again with the knife .
2007_03_15_1833072	16	Officer Cruz responded by firing three times at Mr. Hernandez , but it was unclear if any of those shots hit him .
2007_03_15_1833072	17	Mr. Hernandez attacked Officer Cruz again , plunging the knife so hard into the officer 's temple that it entered his skull , Mr. Browne said , adding that the police had interviewed six witnesses to the attack .
2007_03_15_1833072	18	Mr. Cruz then fired two more shots at Mr. Hernandez , who turned and fled downstairs to the subway platform .
2007_03_15_1833072	19	At that point , although '' he was bleeding profusely , '' Mr. Browne said , Officer Cruz ran after Mr. Hernandez down the length of the platform .
2007_03_15_1833072	20	Other officers who had been summoned found Mr. Hernandez lying on the platform and Officer Cruz kneeling on one knee about three feet away , appearing as if he was about to lose consciousness .
2007_03_15_1833072	21	Officer Cruz was in serious but stable condition at Jamaica Hospital Medical Center , the police said .
2007_03_15_1833072	22	Mr. Hernandez , who was charged yesterday with attempted first-degree murder of a police officer and criminal possession of a weapon , was in guarded condition at Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center after being shot twice in the elbow by Officer Cruz , the police said .
2007_03_15_1833072	23	Mr. Hernandez 's criminal record includes five arrests in New Jersey .
2007_03_15_1833072	24	In 2003 and 2004 , he was charged twice with assaulting police officers in Netcong , Mr. Browne said .
2007_03_15_1833072	25	That led to his deportation to Guatemala in July 2005 , the authorities said .
2007_03_15_1833072	26	Michael Gilhoody , a spokesman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement , said yesterday that Mr. Hernandez had been deported as a felon for life and that it was unclear how he had returned to the area .
2007_03_15_1833072	27	Mr. Gilhoody said Mr. Hernandez 's mere presence in this country could be prosecuted as a federal felony but that any action by the federal government would await the outcome of his prosecution and potential prison term on the charges in New York . ''
2007_03_15_1833072	28	When released from custody , he would revert directly to us , '' Mr. Gilhoody said .
2007_03_15_1833072	29	Officer Cruz was '' stabbed on a subway platform trying to protect this city , '' Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg told reporters yesterday . ''
2007_03_15_1833072	30	And he went into the hospital and had multihour surgery .
2007_03_15_1833072	31	He 's in the I.C.U. , and our prayers are with him .
2007_03_15_1833072	32	Hopefully , he will come out of this fine . ''
2007_03_15_1833072	33	But I just think it 's another example of the kinds of risk that the men and women who work in our Police Department endure every day . ''
2007_03_15_1833072	34	Mr. Hernandez had been living in Freeport , Long Island , with his brother , Roberto , who said yesterday that Mr. Hernandez had experienced bouts of serious depression throughout his life .
2007_03_15_1833072	35	He said Mr. Hernandez received some treatment recently at Nassau University Medical Center and was scheduled to meet yesterday with a representative of an outpatient psychiatric facility on Long Island .
2007_03_15_1833072	36	Roberto Hernandez said the episode Tuesday night could only have resulted from his brother 's depression . ''
2007_03_15_1833072	37	The word for it is insanity , '' he said . ''
2007_03_15_1833072	38	He could not have been himself . ''
2007_03_15_1833074	0	Mark Zoller , a gregarious forward on the University of Pennsylvania basketball team , shared a dorm room three years ago with a skinny , soft-spoken freshman reserve guard who seemed particularly determined not to fade away . ''
2007_03_15_1833074	1	He wanted to develop into being a more vocal leader , '' Zoller said .
2007_03_15_1833074	2	Ibrahim Jaaber had come to Penn with a modest basketball background .
2007_03_15_1833074	3	Only one Division II college had offered him a scholarship when he played at Elizabeth High School in New Jersey , so he decided to go to a prep school to enhance his profile .
2007_03_15_1833074	4	Jaaber starred at the Peddie School , a private school in Hightstown , N.J. , then became a standout guard for Penn while it won the last three Ivy League championships .
2007_03_15_1833074	5	He had the talent to succeed , but adaptability and persistence also helped him reach the N.C.A.A. tournament .
2007_03_15_1833074	6	Jaaber 's interest in topics like leadership and group dynamics led him to major in sociology .
2007_03_15_1833074	7	Although Jaaber is not as loquacious as Zoller or the senior forward Stephen Danley are , his voice carries more clout . ''
2007_03_15_1833074	8	When I came here , I had no idea where I 'd be going , '' Jaaber said last week before a practice .
2007_03_15_1833074	9	Penn ( 22-8 ) , the 14th seed in the South Region , is not being given much of a chance to beat No. 3 seed Texas A&M ( 25-6 ) in a first-round game today in Lexington , Ky. .
2007_03_15_1833074	10	The Quakers have not won an N.C.A.A. tournament game since 1994 . ''
2007_03_15_1833074	11	So why not do something special our last time out ? ''
2007_03_15_1833074	12	Jaaber was born in Brooklyn , lived for a while in North Carolina , and spent most of his childhood in Richmond , Va. , in a neighborhood that he and his mother described as unsafe , before moving to Elizabeth when he was a high school sophomore . ''
2007_03_15_1833074	13	I think he had a better opportunity in Elizabeth for someone else to acknowledge his playing , '' his mother , Aisha Jaaber , said in a telephone interview .
2007_03_15_1833074	14	As a senior , Jaaber helped Elizabeth win the 2002 Union County championship .
2007_03_15_1833074	15	The only scholarship offer he received was from Stonehill College , a Division II program in Easton , Mass. .
2007_03_15_1833074	16	Jaaber thought he could do better .
2007_03_15_1833074	17	Chris Potash , the first-year coach at the Peddie School , had seen Jaaber play once at Elizabeth and had received a scouting report on him from two college assistant coaches .
2007_03_15_1833074	18	Jaaber could help his program , Potash thought .
2007_03_15_1833074	19	But how could Peddie help Jaaber ?
2007_03_15_1833074	20	Peddie had finished 5-15 the year before Potash arrived .
2007_03_15_1833074	21	He had a full scholarship offer in hand , and he had no guarantee that he could parlay one year at a prep school into a Division I offer . ''
2007_03_15_1833074	22	He always had this confidence and self-reliance , '' Potash , now an assistant coach at Drew University , said in a telephone interview . ''
2007_03_15_1833074	23	It was a situation where he took a chance .
2007_03_15_1833074	24	We 've had other kids who took that postgraduate chance , and it was n't worthwhile for them . ''
2007_03_15_1833074	25	Before he played a game at Peddie , Jaaber received an offer from a small Division I college that Potash would not name .
2007_03_15_1833074	26	Jaaber stayed at Peddie .
2007_03_15_1833074	27	He averaged 24 points , 8 rebounds and 8 assists in his year there .
2007_03_15_1833074	28	Peddie lost by 3 points in the Middle Atlantic Prep League semifinals to Blair Academy , a team that included Luol Deng and Charlie Villanueva , who are now playing in the N.B.A. Potash said Jaaber was the best player on the floor that night . ''
2007_03_15_1833074	29	At Peddie , I was able to step into a leadership role , '' Jaaber said , '' and it was n't all sports-related .
2007_03_15_1833074	30	It pretty much gave me a chance to stand out in a lot of ways . ''
2007_03_15_1833074	31	He averaged 6.5 points as a freshman reserve at Penn and 11.5 points as a sophomore .
2007_03_15_1833074	32	He was the Ivy League player of the year last season , when Penn finished 20-9 and lost to Texas , 60-52 , in the first round of the tournament .
2007_03_15_1833074	33	Fran Dunphy , Penn 's coach for 17 seasons , took the job at Temple last April .
2007_03_15_1833074	34	Glen Miller , previously the head coach at Brown , was hired to replace Dunphy , and he soon asked Jaaber if he could move to point guard from shooting guard . ''
2007_03_15_1833074	35	We do n't have a pure point guard in the program , '' Miller said . ''
2007_03_15_1833074	36	That 's an adjustment .
2007_03_15_1833074	37	But he 's accepted it with a good approach , a good attitude . ''
2007_03_15_1833074	38	Jaaber 's scoring average has dropped by 2.3 points a game , to 15.9 from 18.2 , but he has 159 assists , 3 shy of the team 's single-season record set by David Klatsky in 2001 .
2007_03_15_1833074	39	Jaaber was named as the league 's player of the year again .
2007_03_15_1833074	40	Jaaber has gained weight over the course of the season and has grown a wispy goatee .
2007_03_15_1833074	41	Penn students love him , chanting '' Ibby Jaaber '' after he makes a big basket .
2007_03_15_1833074	42	But he still expects a lot from himself .
2007_03_15_1833074	43	In some ways , nothing has changed . ''
2007_03_15_1833074	44	Most of the time , I feel like I 'm in a bubble when I 'm on the court , '' Jaaber said . ''
2007_03_15_1833074	45	Even though people are watching me , I 'm in my head when I 'm playing the game . ''
2007_03_15_1833075	0	A Canadian philosopher who believes spirituality is an essential part of the study of philosophy and the social sciences has won the $ 1.5 million Templeton Prize for advancement and research of spiritual matters .
2007_03_15_1833075	1	The recipient , Charles Taylor , 75 , is a professor of law and philosophy at Northwestern University in Evanston , Ill. , and professor emeritus at McGill University in Montreal .
2007_03_15_1833075	2	Professor Taylor has written extensively on the sense of self and how it is defined by morals and what one considers good .
2007_03_15_1833075	3	People operate in the register of spiritual issues , he said , and separating those from the humanities and the social sciences leads to flawed conclusions . ''
2007_03_15_1833075	4	The deafness of many philosophers , social scientists and historians to the spiritual dimension can be remarkable , '' Professor Taylor said in prepared remarks yesterday at the announcement of the prize at the Church Center for the United Nations in New York .
2007_03_15_1833075	5	This is damaging , he said , because it '' affects the culture of the media and educated public opinion in general . ''
2007_03_15_1833075	6	Professor Taylor , a Roman Catholic who said in an interview that he was heavily influenced by documents from the Second Vatican Council that he read as a young man in Quebec , is studying how spirituality influences those who commit random violence and whether traditionally spiritual motivations like a sense of purpose could be a factor .
2007_03_15_1833075	7	Professor Taylor said his work '' digs into the kinds of human motivation that do n't usually arise '' in sociological studies of violence , like the '' search for meaning . ''
2007_03_15_1833075	8	He said he would use the prize money to advance his research .
2007_03_15_1833075	9	The prize was established in 1972 by the investor and philanthropist Sir John Templeton and always exceeds the monetary value of the Nobel Prize because of Sir John 's belief that advances in the spiritual realm can reap greater benefits than those in the secular .
2007_03_15_1833075	10	Professor Taylor will be awarded the prize by Prince Philip at Buckingham Palace on May 2 .
2007_03_15_1833075	11	John M. Templeton Jr. , the president of the Templeton Foundation , said in a statement that Professor Taylor had often staked a '' lonely position '' in discussions of public policy and the humanities , but one that provides '' a fresh understanding of the many problems of the world and , potentially , how we might together resolve them . ''
2007_03_15_1833077	0	American Electric Power , a major electric utility , is planning the largest demonstration yet of capturing carbon dioxide from a coal-fired power plant and pumping it deep underground .
2007_03_15_1833077	1	Various experts consider that approach , known as sequestration , essential to reining in climate change by preventing the gas from being added to the atmospheric blanket that promotes global warming .
2007_03_15_1833077	2	The project , to be announced Thursday by American Electric Power , based in Columbus , Ohio , will use a new process -- so far tested only at laboratory scale -- that uses chilled ammonia to absorb the gas for collection .
2007_03_15_1833077	3	The process was developed by Alstom , a major manufacturer of generating equipment , and aims to reduce the amount of energy required to capture the carbon dioxide .
2007_03_15_1833077	4	Some experts have estimated that nearly a third of a power plant 's energy output might be needed to pull carbon dioxide from the waste stream .
2007_03_15_1833077	5	Alstom hopes to hold it to 15 percent .
2007_03_15_1833077	6	The cost must be kept as low as possible if the technology is to be used on a wide scale .
2007_03_15_1833077	7	Congress is seen as unlikely to impose enormously expensive restraints on emissions .
2007_03_15_1833077	8	And under proposals to cap emissions nationally and let companies trade credits for extra reductions , only the cheapest methods of reducing greenhouse gases would thrive in the marketplace .
2007_03_15_1833077	9	A report released Wednesday by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology called for prompt work on demonstrating the necessary sequestration technologies .
2007_03_15_1833077	10	The co-chairman of that study , Ernest J. Moniz , a former assistant secretary of energy , said the unusually large scale of the American Electric project made it '' quite relevant . ''
2007_03_15_1833077	11	Climate policy specialists said the project was a significant test of the technology and also a sign that American Electric , which relies on coal for fuel , is expecting carbon emission limits of some kind .
2007_03_15_1833077	12	The initial trial , at the company 's Mountaineer plant in New Haven , W.Va. , will take a portion of the carbon dioxide from the flue , compress it into liquid form at more than 1,000 pounds of pressure per square inch , and inject it 9,000 feet below the earth 's surface , a technique that experts say is not well understood but would be essential to large-scale carbon sequestration .
2007_03_15_1833077	13	The project will begin next year , the company said .
2007_03_15_1833077	14	A demonstration 6 to 12 times that size , which would be commercial scale , will be conducted soon after at a plant in Oklahoma . ''
2007_03_15_1833077	15	This basically represents jumping ahead , '' said Stuart M. Dalton , director of generation at the Electric Power Research Institute , a utility consortium , in Palo Alto , Calif. .
2007_03_15_1833077	16	His organization has helped organize a test , one-sixth the size of the West Virginia test , that is supposed to begin this year at a coal-fired power plant in Wisconsin .
2007_03_15_1833077	17	That carbon will be re-released .
2007_03_15_1833077	18	Some plants use a different separation technology to capture and sell food-grade carbon dioxide , used in making carbonated beverages .
2007_03_15_1833077	19	Worldwide , there are several places where carbon dioxide is injected into deep wells , but none are power plants .
2007_03_15_1833077	20	At the Natural Resources Defense Council , an environmental group , David G. Hawkins , a climate expert , said , '' Under any plausible scenarios of global coal use , we are going to need carbon dioxide capture and storage . ''
2007_03_15_1833077	21	But Mr. Hawkins and other environmentalists said that Congress should not wait for the outcome of demonstrations like American Electric 's to order mandatory controls on carbon emissions .
2007_03_15_1833077	22	Michael G. Morris , the president , chairman and chief executive of the utility , said in a telephone interview that sequestration would be necessary for society but was also enlightened self-interest on the part of his company .
2007_03_15_1833077	23	The Energy Department has concentrated on a different technology , converting coal to a gas and taking the carbon out before the gas is burned .
2007_03_15_1833077	24	American Electric is also pursuing that technology , but the chilled-ammonia method is applicable to traditional coal plants that use pulverized coal technology , and dozens of them are on the drawing boards . ''
2007_03_15_1833077	25	You , me and everyone else needs to understand that the government talks big and moves slow , '' Mr. Morris said .
2007_03_15_1833077	26	He said the demonstration would cost $ 800 million , including work to remove conventional pollutants like soot and sulfur dioxide before carbon separation .
2007_03_15_1833077	27	The company will seek federal grants and will ask state regulators to let it charge customers .
2007_03_15_1833077	28	Carbon from the larger trial at the Oklahoma plant will be sold for injection into old oil fields where pressure and production have fallen .
2007_03_15_1833078	0	When asked to identify the two most important items from their list of 10 public policy commandments , most antigovernment crusaders pick ( 1 ) public spending shall be kept to an absolute minimum and ( 2 ) the state shall not transfer income from rich to poor .
2007_03_15_1833078	1	No government heeds these admonitions in any literal sense .
2007_03_15_1833078	2	Yet they have had a profound impact on public policy decisions , especially in the United States .
2007_03_15_1833078	3	Often , however , their impact has been the opposite of what antigovernment crusaders intended .
2007_03_15_1833078	4	The problem is that many compellingly advantageous public policies can not be enacted without violating the two commandments .
2007_03_15_1833078	5	Every significant policy change benefits some people and harms others .
2007_03_15_1833078	6	If the gains to winners substantially outweigh the costs to losers , solutions can always be found that allow everyone to come out ahead .
2007_03_15_1833078	7	But those solutions often involve higher taxes and income transfers to the poor .
2007_03_15_1833078	8	Regulations that limit auto emissions are a case in point .
2007_03_15_1833078	9	Because these regulations increase car prices , legislators in most jurisdictions exempt older vehicles to avoid imposing unacceptable costs on the mostly low-income motorists who drive them .
2007_03_15_1833078	10	Yet the cost to society of this exemption far outweighs its benefit for the poor .
2007_03_15_1833078	11	For example , although fewer than 10 percent of the vehicles in Los Angeles are more than 15 years old , these cars account for more than half the smog .
2007_03_15_1833078	12	Exempting the old cars thus necessitates much stricter regulations for new ones .
2007_03_15_1833078	13	But the cheapest ways of reducing emissions from new cars have long since been adopted .
2007_03_15_1833078	14	According to a RAND Corporation study , meeting air quality targets by further tightening new-car standards is several times as costly as meeting those targets by eliminating the exemption for older vehicles .
2007_03_15_1833078	15	By raising taxes on high-income motorists , the government could finance vouchers that would enable low-income motorists to scrap their older vehicles in favor of cleaner used cars of more recent vintage .
2007_03_15_1833078	16	The required taxes would be much smaller than the resulting savings from not having to adopt such costly standards for new vehicles .
2007_03_15_1833078	17	Both rich and poor motorists would win .
2007_03_15_1833078	18	The problem is that taking these steps would violate the two commandments .
2007_03_15_1833078	19	Antigovernment crusaders have prevailed for now .
2007_03_15_1833078	20	The ostensible champions of economic efficiency , they have kept government budgets smaller and blocked some transfers to low-income families .
2007_03_15_1833078	21	In the process , however , they have made everyone poorer .
2007_03_15_1833078	22	Some believe that minimal government is synonymous with economic efficiency .
2007_03_15_1833078	23	But it is not .
2007_03_15_1833078	24	As the emissions example illustrates , economic efficiency sometimes requires that government play a larger role .
2007_03_15_1833078	25	This example is part of a much broader pattern .
2007_03_15_1833078	26	In health care , for example , the private insurance system employed in the United States delivers worse outcomes at substantially higher cost than the single-payer system employed in virtually every other industrial country .
2007_03_15_1833078	27	But switching to the single-payer system would require higher taxes and increased benefits for low-income citizens , steps that would violate the two commandments .
2007_03_15_1833078	28	So for now , we remain saddled with a system that everyone agrees is dysfunctional .
2007_03_15_1833078	29	In the realm of antipoverty policy , most economists agree that raising the earned-income tax credit would be the most efficient way of increasing the living standard of the working poor .
2007_03_15_1833078	30	Under this program , general tax revenues support income subsidies to those whose earnings fall below a given threshold .
2007_03_15_1833078	31	Its compelling advantage is that unlike a higher minimum wage , it does not discourage hiring .
2007_03_15_1833078	32	But raising taxes to increase the earned-income tax credit would violate the two commandments .
2007_03_15_1833078	33	Because the most efficient antipoverty policy is deemed politically unfeasible , many economists support current legislative proposals to raise the minimum wage for the first time in a decade .
2007_03_15_1833078	34	If this legislation passes , antigovernment crusaders will be able to claim , truthfully , to have prevented an increase in the federal budget .
2007_03_15_1833078	35	But they will have won a hollow victory .
2007_03_15_1833078	36	For unlike an increase in the earned-income tax credit , an increase in the minimum wage not only limits job creation for the least - skilled workers , it also raises the prices of goods they produce .
2007_03_15_1833078	37	Over all , it would have been cheaper to raise the earned-income tax credit .
2007_03_15_1833078	38	Antigovernment crusaders have also prevented the adoption of energy policies that would produce better outcomes for all .
2007_03_15_1833078	39	For example , economists of all political stripes have argued that a stiff tax on gasoline would relieve traffic congestion , reduce greenhouse gases , accelerate the development of energy-saving technologies and reduce dependence on foreign oil .
2007_03_15_1833078	40	But it would also impose significant economic hardship on low-income families , making it necessary to increase transfer payments to those families .
2007_03_15_1833078	41	Both the tax on gasoline and the transfers to low-income families would be clear violations of the two commandments .
2007_03_15_1833078	42	And so gasoline taxes continue to be far lower in the United States than in other industrial countries .
2007_03_15_1833078	43	That democratic forces limit the economic hardship that government can impose on low-income families is a good thing .
2007_03_15_1833078	44	But sometimes imposing hardships on those families would create far larger gains for society as a whole .
2007_03_15_1833078	45	In such cases , we can always devise solutions that make everyone better off .
2007_03_15_1833078	46	But it is impossible to put these solutions into practice without violating the two commandments .
2007_03_15_1833078	47	Is it better to solve a problem by spending two extra dollars in the private sector than by spending one additional dollar in the public sector ?
2007_03_15_1833078	48	The two commandments insist , preposterously , that it is .
2007_03_15_1833078	49	Economic efficiency is a worthy goal because when the economic pie grows larger , everyone can have a larger slice than before .
2007_03_15_1833078	50	Antigovernment crusaders deserve credit for emphasizing the importance of this goal .
2007_03_15_1833078	51	But as events of recent years have repeatedly demonstrated , they are often the biggest obstacles to its achievement .
2007_03_15_1833078	52	ECONOMIC SCENE Robert H. Frank , an economist at the Johnson School of Management at Cornell University , is the author of '' The Economic Naturalist , '' which will be published this spring .
2007_03_15_1833079	0	An unusual coalition of industrial and developing countries began pushing Wednesday for stringent limits on the world 's most popular refrigerant for air-conditioners , as evidence mounts that the refrigerant harms the earth 's ozone layer and contributes to global warming .
2007_03_15_1833079	1	The coalition is pitted against China , which has become the world 's leading manufacturer of air-conditioners that use the refrigerant , HCFC-22 .
2007_03_15_1833079	2	Most window air-conditioners and air-conditioning systems in the United States use this refrigerant , as well .
2007_03_15_1833079	3	International pressure has grown rapidly this winter for quick action . ''
2007_03_15_1833079	4	We scientifically have proof : if we accelerate the phaseout of HCFC , we are going to make a great contribution to climate change , '' said Romina Picolotti , the chief of Argentina 's environmental secretariat .
2007_03_15_1833079	5	An accelerated phaseout of the refrigerant could speed up by five years the healing of the ozone layer of the atmosphere .
2007_03_15_1833079	6	It could also cut emissions of global-warming gases by the equivalent of at least one-sixth of the reductions called for under the Kyoto Protocol .
2007_03_15_1833079	7	The United States joined Argentina , Brazil , Iceland , Mauritania and Norway on Wednesday in notifying the Ozone Secretariat of the United Nations Environment Program that they want to negotiate an accelerated phaseout of hydrochlorofluorocarbons , or HCFC 's , at an international conference in Montreal in September .
2007_03_15_1833079	8	The conference is tied to the 20th anniversary of the signing of the Montreal Protocol , which has reduced emissions of most ozone-depleting gases but left a loophole for HCFC-22 production by developing countries .
2007_03_15_1833079	9	China has repeatedly said it will honor all current rules of the Montreal Protocol but does not want to add new ones .
2007_03_15_1833079	10	Recent studies have shown that steeply rising production of HCFC-22 by China , India and other developing countries has slowed the healing of the ozone layer , which protects humans , animals and vegetation from the sun 's dangerous ultraviolet rays .
2007_03_15_1833079	11	A report last week by five American and European scientists found that sharp cutbacks in emissions of ozone-depleting gases since 1987 have been far more effective in combating global warming than the Kyoto Protocol , the 1997 agreement that was aimed directly at limiting climate change .
2007_03_15_1833079	12	HCFC 's and other ozone-depleting gases are extremely powerful warming gases .
2007_03_15_1833079	13	Gram for gram , the ones used as refrigerants have thousands of times the global-warming effect of carbon dioxide .
2007_03_15_1833079	14	The ozone-depleting gases are released in far smaller quantities , though , than carbon dioxide , which is emitted when fossil fuels are burned by vehicle engines , power plants and other users .
2007_03_15_1833079	15	The report by the European and American experts , published last week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , found that the Montreal Protocol had proved to be 5.5 times as effective as the Kyoto accord was intended to be in cutting emissions of global-warming gases .
2007_03_15_1833079	16	The Montreal agreement has been in force much longer and applies to developing and industrial nations alike , while the Kyoto Protocol has binding limits only for industrial nations .
2007_03_15_1833079	17	The report has caught the attention of countries in the Pacific and Indian Oceans that fear that global warming will lead to a rise in sea levels and a significant loss of their limited land . ''
2007_03_15_1833079	18	As small island nations , our main concern is that whatever touches the climate has to be dealt with fairly quickly , '' said Sateeaved Seebaluck , permanent secretary in the environment ministry of Mauritius , an island nation well east of Africa in the Indian Ocean .
2007_03_15_1833079	19	Mr. Seebaluck said that a flurry of news reports about HCFC-22 this winter had been widely e-mailed among specialists and had led to greatly increased international interest in addressing the problem .
2007_03_15_1833079	20	The Montreal Protocol currently allows developing countries to keep increasing their production of HCFC-22 until 2016 , and then freezes production at that level until 2040 , when it is supposed to be halted .
2007_03_15_1833079	21	But that schedule was devised in the early 1990s , when HCFC-22 was used mainly in industrial nations ; developing countries were seen as too poor ever to afford much of the chemical .
2007_03_15_1833079	22	The Kyoto Protocol then exempted HCFC-22 and other ozone-depleting substances from production and consumption limits on the grounds that the Montreal agreement had already addressed those matters .
2007_03_15_1833079	23	Use of HCFC-22 has soared in the third world with the economic growth of China , India and other countries , along with the sharp drop in air-conditioner costs that has accompanied China 's growing skill in making them cheaply .
2007_03_15_1833079	24	Mr. Seebaluck said Mauritius 's use of HCFC-22 had risen more than 100-fold in the last six years because of a boom in hotel construction and the rapid expansion of the fishing industry , which uses a lot of refrigeration to preserve freshness .
2007_03_15_1833079	25	The use in India and China , far larger markets , has been rising as much as 35 percent a year lately , with specialists predicting that similar growth could last through 2016 .
2007_03_15_1833079	26	Industrial nations are required to phase out HCFC-22 by 2020 , but most are moving faster .
2007_03_15_1833079	27	The European Union phased it out in 2004 .
2007_03_15_1833079	28	The United States will ban domestic production in 2010 and is considering whether to ban imports then , as well .
2007_03_15_1833079	29	China has begun making air-conditioners with more modern refrigerants for the European market .
2007_03_15_1833079	30	But by continuing to produce HCFC-22 for markets elsewhere , the Chinese have been able to claim hundreds of millions of dollars a year in payments from an obscure United Nations agency .
2007_03_15_1833079	31	The payments are to compensate Chinese chemical factories for incinerating a waste gas generated as part of the manufacturing process for HCFC-22 .
2007_03_15_1833079	32	If the Chinese industry switches to modern refrigerants , it would no longer produce the waste gas and so would lose the credits .
2007_03_15_1833079	33	India has a large and growing HCFC-22 industry that is also reaping a fortune in credits .
2007_03_15_1833079	34	But the Indian government has largely stayed on the sidelines in international talks , while China has called for industrial nations to pay even more for the incineration of waste gases from HCFC-22 production ; China proposes to spend much of that to develop its renewable-energy industry .
2007_03_15_1833079	35	A big problem is that no one has agreed what should replace HCFC-22 .
2007_03_15_1833079	36	The chemicals requiring the fewest changes to air-conditioner designs avoid harm to the ozone layer but are still as potent , gram for gram , in terms of global warming .
2007_03_15_1833079	37	Mack McFarland , chief atmospheric scientist at DuPont , said the company had developed a chemical that also has little effect on global warming .
2007_03_15_1833079	38	But the chemical is suitable only for vehicle air-conditioners , not the building air-conditioners that now rely on HCFC-22 .
2007_03_15_1833079	39	Environmentalists contend that chemical companies and air-conditioner makers are too slow to embrace other refrigerants , like ammonia or carbon dioxide , that may pose technical challenges but could be better for the ozone layer and global warming . ''
2007_03_15_1833079	40	Industry certainly is somewhat concerned about some of those chemicals because some of them do n't promise a lot of profits , '' said Alexander von Bismarck , campaigns director of the Environmental Investigation Agency , a Washington advocacy group .
2007_03_15_1833079	41	David Doniger , climate policy director at the Natural Resources Defense Council , said that even switching to new commercial refrigerants that are potent global-warming agents could help the environment .
2007_03_15_1833079	42	Air-conditioners designed for the new refrigerants tend to be more energy-efficient and often do not use as much refrigerant , he said .
2007_03_15_1833080	0	Bowing to a native son 's passion for proper punctuation and etymological exactitude , the General Assembly has put the English-speaking world on notice : the possessive case of '' Arkansas '' requires an '' 's . ''
2007_03_15_1833080	1	As in , Arkansas 's many wonders .
2007_03_15_1833080	2	Please , not Arkansas ' . ''
2007_03_15_1833080	3	It 's esoteric , I agree , '' said one of those wonders , Parker L. Westbrook , 81 , a stickler for language and an authority on all things Arkansan , including its politics , '' but that does n't mean it is n't important . ''
2007_03_15_1833080	4	Indeed , a resolution passed Tuesday by the Senate requires that spelling in all official documents .
2007_03_15_1833080	5	The measure , written by Mr. Westbrook , was approved by the House last week .
2007_03_15_1833080	6	Gov. Mike Beebe is expected to sign it .
2007_03_15_1833080	7	Although not every manual of style agrees with the resolution , which does not specify criminal sanctions for failure to comply , the silent second '' s '' in Arkansas demands an apostrophe and a third '' s '' to form the possessive , Mr. Westbrook insisted , lest precision count for nothing .
2007_03_15_1833080	8	( For the record , the style manual at The New York Times agrees with Mr. Westbrook . )
2007_03_15_1833080	9	Had the State Legislature not decreed in 1881 that the name '' Arkansas '' would end with a silent 's , ' there would be no cause for concern , he said . ''
2007_03_15_1833080	10	This is not an apostrophe battle , '' he added . ''
2007_03_15_1833080	11	It 's a war to recognize the definition of the word ` silent . ' ''
2007_03_15_1833080	12	There was some silent rolling of eyes amid the ayes , but no legislator dared seriously challenge the research or the resolve of Mr. Westbrook .
2007_03_15_1833080	13	Since 1949 , he has been an aide to a governor , two United States senators and two congressmen .
2007_03_15_1833080	14	They included Representative Boyd A. Tackett , whose grandson , State Representative Steven P. Harrelson , Democrat of Texarkana , sponsored the resolution . ''
2007_03_15_1833080	15	As much as anything it 's a tribute to Parker , '' Mr. Harrelson said with a chuckle , citing Mr. Westbrook 's dedication to historic preservation .
2007_03_15_1833081	0	The sex offender who was convicted last week of the rape and murder of Jessica Lunsford , 9 , in 2005 should be executed , a jury recommended on Wednesday .
2007_03_15_1833081	1	The 12-member jury deliberated about an hour before voting , 10 to 2 .
2007_03_15_1833081	2	to recommend the death penalty for the murderer , John E. Couey .
2007_03_15_1833081	3	It had found Mr. Couey guilty of first-degree murder , burglary , kidnapping and sexual battery . ''
2007_03_15_1833081	4	This is justice for Jessie , '' Jessica 's father , Mark Lunsford , said outside the courthouse . ''
2007_03_15_1833081	5	In the penalty phase of the trial , which began Tuesday , defense lawyers argued for a life sentence .
2007_03_15_1833081	6	They presented mental health experts who said Mr. Couey , 48 , is retarded and has other mental problems .
2007_03_15_1833081	7	Experts called by the prosecution rejected those views . ''
2007_03_15_1833081	8	Mental health issues had nothing to do with this crime , '' the prosecutor , Ric Ridgway , said in closing arguments . ''
2007_03_15_1833081	9	If this is not the person who deserves the death penalty , who does ? ''
2007_03_15_1833081	10	Mr. Couey 's lawyer , Alan Fanter , asked jurors to let his client live , saying , '' Justice is not vengeance . ''
2007_03_15_1833081	11	The jury recommendation will be heavily considered by Judge Richard A. Howard of Circuit Court in Citrus County .
2007_03_15_1833081	12	The judge will make the final determination in several weeks .
2007_03_15_1833081	13	Jessica 's family reported her missing in February 2005 when they realized that she had disappeared from her bedroom in Homosassa , 55 miles north of Tampa .
2007_03_15_1833081	14	Her body was found three weeks later .
2007_03_15_1833081	15	The authorities said she had been buried alive outside Mr. Couey 's mobile home .
2007_03_15_1833081	16	Mr. Couey confessed and directed investigators to the body .
2007_03_15_1833081	17	Judge Howard did not allow the confession in the trial because Mr. Couey had not been granted a lawyer when he confessed .
2007_03_15_1833081	18	The trial was moved 300 miles to Miami because of heavy publicity .
2007_03_15_1833081	19	Mr. Couey , convicted in 1991 for exposing and fondling himself in the presence of a 5-year-old girl , was registered as a sex offender , but skipped counseling sessions and moved without telling parole officers .
2007_03_15_1833081	20	In April 2005 , the Florida Legislature passed the Jessica Lunsford Act , which requires prison sentences of at least 25 years for child molesting and permanent electronic monitoring for many sex offenders .
2007_03_15_1833082	0	REMEMBER the perky commercials that began with the ringing of a doorbell followed by the words '' Avon calling '' ?
2007_03_15_1833082	1	Now , years later , Avon wants to ring billions of doorbells at the same time with the largest campaign in its 121-year history .
2007_03_15_1833082	2	The campaign , now getting under way , carries the upbeat theme '' Hello tomorrow . ''
2007_03_15_1833082	3	The ads are the first work from a new Avon creative agency , Soho Square in New York , part of the WPP Group , which has been developing the campaign since September 2005 . ''
2007_03_15_1833082	4	It was a journey in getting there , '' said Elizabeth Smith , executive vice president at Avon Products in New York , who is president for Avon North American and global marketing . ''
2007_03_15_1833082	5	It was not a matter of , ` Gee , I love that brand , ' '' she added , explaining what the campaign is meant to accomplish , but rather an effort to express that Avon '' is the company that best understands and empowers women . ''
2007_03_15_1833082	6	The campaign seeks to recruit sales representatives to join the more than five million who already work for Avon , as well as to build morale among employees of the company , which recently went through layoffs .
2007_03_15_1833082	7	The campaign also has a worldwide scope , in keeping with a recent reorganization of Avon by Andrea Jung , its chief executive , to make more decisions along global lines in areas like marketing .
2007_03_15_1833082	8	To reflect the ambitious nature of the campaign , Avon plans to increase ad spending this year to $ 340 million , compared with $ 250 million in 2006 and $ 135 million in 2005 . ''
2007_03_15_1833082	9	We feel wonderful about the message , '' Ms. Smith said , '' and we 're backing it up with the dollars . ''
2007_03_15_1833082	10	A marketing expert said that the campaign might still fall short . ''
2007_03_15_1833082	11	The issue remains as to whether Ms. Jung can use this effort to enthuse and energize her five million sales representatives , '' said Peter Sealey , a former marketing executive for companies like Coca-Cola . ''
2007_03_15_1833082	12	Maybe she can rally the troops , '' said Mr. Sealey , who is adjunct professor of marketing at the Drucker School of Management at Claremont Graduate University , but he said the real issue was what he called a conflict between relying on a sales force and embracing the opportunity to sell in a more '' pervasive and personal '' way , through the Internet .
2007_03_15_1833082	13	The campaign has an online component , at avon.com , where Avon has been selling products for the last decade , along with television commercials , print advertisements and brochures .
2007_03_15_1833082	14	There is also a cause-marketing element .
2007_03_15_1833082	15	Avon is founding a Hello Tomorrow Fund and pledges to donate money through it to organizations in 18 countries that help women in areas like business development and community service .
2007_03_15_1833082	16	The campaign has a broader reach than the sales force and company employees , Ms. Smith said .
2007_03_15_1833082	17	It is also intended to burnish the Avon brand image among consumers as well as help sell Avon products like lipsticks , skin lotions , fragrances and moisturizers . ''
2007_03_15_1833082	18	Avon is one of those classic brands that everyone knows , '' said Nicola Bell , client services director at Soho Square , '' but they 've come to a point in time when they needed to re-energize the brand across all audiences . ''
2007_03_15_1833082	19	After research by the agency determined that Avon had to '' look for a more fresh , contemporary expression of its values in terms of empowering and supporting women , '' Ms. Bell said , a decision was made to speak in an optimistic tone as epitomized by the '' Hello tomorrow '' theme . ''
2007_03_15_1833082	20	The category is full of advertising that can sometimes make women feel a little guilty about the way they look and be a bit judgmental , '' Ms. Bell said . ''
2007_03_15_1833082	21	We 're saying , ` Look to the future with optimism , look at aging with confidence . ' ''
2007_03_15_1833082	22	The idea that a women 's beauty and skin care brand can take a positive approach , in contrast to the typical pitch for the category , is gaining popularity .
2007_03_15_1833082	23	For example , a sibling agency of Soho Square , Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide , has been lauded for ads for the Dove brand sold by Unilever , which can be seen online at Web sites that include dove.com and campaignforrealbeauty.com .
2007_03_15_1833082	24	The initial two commercials in the Avon campaign , looking to recruit sales representatives , feature actual saleswomen , the company says .
2007_03_15_1833082	25	In one spot , the women are extremely enthusiastic , making statements like '' I love my job , '' '' I love the fact that Avon sells itself '' and '' Anyone can do this . ''
2007_03_15_1833082	26	In the other spot , the tone is more measured .
2007_03_15_1833082	27	The saleswomen make statements like '' We do business online now . ''
2007_03_15_1833082	28	One praises Avon for introducing '' new products that fit into your life , not the other way around . ''
2007_03_15_1833082	29	Another describes how the money she makes helps put her children through college .
2007_03_15_1833082	30	Ms. Smith said the two points of view were deliberate , to appeal to different types of prospective sales representatives . ''
2007_03_15_1833082	31	Some people have more pragmatic reasons , '' she added , and '' some have more entrepreneurial vision . ''
2007_03_15_1833082	32	The commercials , as well as the rest of the campaign , were tested in Avon markets , including Brazil , China and Poland , Ms. Smith said , and '' to a country it worked on the same emotional level . ''
2007_03_15_1833082	33	The campaign is at least the third recent effort for a marketer that uses '' Hello '' as a welcoming word .
2007_03_15_1833082	34	The minitrend may have started with ads last summer for Level vodka , sold by V&S Vin & Sprit , which carry the headline '' Hello delicious . ''
2007_03_15_1833082	35	Next came a commercial for the Apple iPhone , which began appearing during the Academy Awards show on Feb. 25 .
2007_03_15_1833082	36	The spot features snippets from movies and TV shows in which stars like Marilyn Monroe , Jackie Gleason and Robert Redford answer the telephone .
2007_03_15_1833082	37	The commercial , which can also be watched on apple.com , ends with the words '' Hello '' and '' Coming in June '' onscreen .
2007_03_15_1833082	38	Typically , such convergence is coincidental , according to a leading Madison Avenue creative executive , who said it could be difficult to trace sources of inspiration . ''
2007_03_15_1833082	39	Maybe it 's the planets , '' said Sal DeVito , creative director at DeVito/Verdi , known for campaigns for advertisers like Daffy 's , Legal Sea Foods and New York magazine . ''
2007_03_15_1833082	40	It 's happened to us a few times . ''
2007_03_15_1833083	0	Web search companies collect records of the searches that people conduct , a fact that has long generated fears among privacy advocates and some Internet users that valuable personal data could be misused .
2007_03_15_1833083	1	Now Google is taking a step to ease those concerns .
2007_03_15_1833083	2	The company keeps logs of all searches , along with digital identifiers linking them to specific computers and Internet browsers .
2007_03_15_1833083	3	It said on Wednesday that it would start to make those logs anonymous after 18 to 24 months , making it much harder to connect search records to a person .
2007_03_15_1833083	4	Under current practices , the company keeps the logs intact indefinitely . ''
2007_03_15_1833083	5	We have decided to make this change with feedback from privacy advocates , regulators worldwide and , of course , from our users , '' said Nicole Wong , Google 's deputy general counsel .
2007_03_15_1833083	6	But it is unclear whether the change will have its intended effect .
2007_03_15_1833083	7	Privacy advocates reacted with a mix of praise and dismay to it . ''
2007_03_15_1833083	8	This is really the first time we have seen them make a decision to try and work out the conflict between wanting to be pro-privacy and collecting all the world 's information , '' said Ari Schwartz , deputy director of the Center for Democracy and Technology , an advocacy group . ''
2007_03_15_1833083	9	They are not going to keep a profile on you indefinitely . ''
2007_03_15_1833083	10	Others were less enthusiastic . ''
2007_03_15_1833083	11	I think it is an absolute disaster for online privacy , '' said Marc Rotenberg , executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center .
2007_03_15_1833083	12	Mr. Rotenberg said his organization has been trying to combat efforts by law enforcement officials to require online services to retain search records for long periods of time .
2007_03_15_1833083	13	He said that 18 to 24 months was too long , and added that because of Google 's dominant position , it would most likely set a de facto standard for data retention .
2007_03_15_1833083	14	Ms. Wong said Google uses the search data internally only to improve its search engine and other services .
2007_03_15_1833083	15	She added that Google would release search data only if compelled by a subpoena .
2007_03_15_1833083	16	Even so , Google was the only major search engine to resist a Justice Department subpoena for vast amounts of search data last year -- a move that drew praise from privacy advocates .
2007_03_15_1833083	17	Just how personally revealing such data can be became evident last year , when AOL released records of the searches conducted by 657,000 Americans for the benefit of researchers .
2007_03_15_1833083	18	While AOL did not identify the people behind the searches , reporters from The New York Times were able to track down some of them quickly through their search requests .
2007_03_15_1833083	19	The ensuing flap caused AOL to tighten its privacy policies .
2007_03_15_1833083	20	The company now keeps search histories for only 13 months and does not link them to Internet protocol addresses -- digital tags that can identify a specific computer .
2007_03_15_1833083	21	For its part , Yahoo keeps search data for '' as long as it is useful , '' said a spokeswoman , Nissa Anklesaria .
2007_03_15_1833083	22	And Microsoft said that while it does not keep search histories alongside I.P. addresses , it can connect the two if law enforcement requests it .
2007_03_15_1833083	23	For Web companies , tying search histories to individuals or groups can be lucrative .
2007_03_15_1833083	24	Companies like Microsoft and Yahoo , for instance , use such information to customize the ads they display .
2007_03_15_1833083	25	While Google does not currently do this so-called behavioral targeting , some analysts believe it might do so in the future .
2007_03_15_1833083	26	Google may be tightening its privacy policy around search logs , but the company recently relaxed its privacy practices in another area .
2007_03_15_1833083	27	Earlier this year , Google users who signed up for services like Gmail that require them to sign in started to be automatically enrolled in a service called personalized search .
2007_03_15_1833083	28	The service tracks a user 's search history and tailors search results accordingly .
2007_03_15_1833083	29	Previously , users had to specifically choose to enroll in personalized search .
2007_03_15_1833083	30	Users can opt out of the personalized search service and delete their search history .
2007_03_15_1833083	31	Still , some analysts believe Google should give users more notice . ''
2007_03_15_1833083	32	I do n't know that a lot of people have realized that that kind of change has happened , '' said Danny Sullivan , who edits the blog SearchEngineLand.com . ''
2007_03_15_1833083	33	You can delete your search history at any time -- if you remember . ''
2007_03_15_1833084	0	Sixty years ago , The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists of Chicago created its so-called Doomsday Clock to alert the world to the perils of the post-Hiroshima age .
2007_03_15_1833084	1	The editors originally set the clock at seven minutes to midnight and over the years have moved the big hand closer or farther away depending on the perceived threat of nuclear war .
2007_03_15_1833084	2	In 1953 , they moved it to two minutes to midnight , and most recently , in January , put it at five minutes till .
2007_03_15_1833084	3	The magazine 's staff is now on an additional kind of alert .
2007_03_15_1833084	4	It was declared a finalist yesterday for a National Magazine Award for general excellence and is counting the days to May 1 , when the awards , the industry 's most prestigious , will be announced at a ceremony in Lincoln Center .
2007_03_15_1833084	5	The magazine , now called The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists , is one of five nominees for general excellence for magazines with a circulation under 100,000 .
2007_03_15_1833084	6	It is way under , at just 10,000 .
2007_03_15_1833084	7	Another nominee is last year 's winner , The Virginia Quarterly Review , which is among the finalists in the fiction category , a category that it also won last year .
2007_03_15_1833084	8	Other nominees for general excellence in the under-100 ,000 set were I.D. , Metropolis and Print .
2007_03_15_1833084	9	The New Yorker magazine had the most nominations again this year , nine , including general excellence in its circulation category of one million to two million .
2007_03_15_1833084	10	The other general-excellence finalists in that circulation category were : Entertainment Weekly , Field & Stream , More Magazine , and Rolling Stone .
2007_03_15_1833084	11	In the biggest circulation category , over two million , the nominees for general excellence were : Glamour , which won two years ago ; Martha Stewart Living ; National Geographic ; O , The Oprah Magazine ; and Time , which won last year .
2007_03_15_1833084	12	A complete list of finalists can be found at www.magazine.org .
2007_03_15_1833084	13	The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists , based at the University of Chicago , has won one National Magazine Award before , in 1987 , for its single issue devoted to Chernobyl .
2007_03_15_1833084	14	This year 's nomination for general excellence is based on three issues , including one that debated whether a nuclear attack on the United States was more likely or less likely now , five years after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks .
2007_03_15_1833084	15	Mark Strauss , editor of the bulletin , said he received word of the nomination in an e-mail message yesterday from the American Society of Magazine Editors , which sponsors the awards in association with the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism .
2007_03_15_1833084	16	He said the small staff , with four editors and one art director , celebrated by '' taking five minutes out to pat ourselves on the back '' and then returned to putting out the next issue . ''
2007_03_15_1833084	17	Deadlines wait for no one , '' Mr. Strauss said .
2007_03_15_1833085	0	When it comes to the birth of a sinkhole , a big bang there is not .
2007_03_15_1833085	1	Shofi Ieslam did not hear one , anyway .
2007_03_15_1833085	2	He was working the day shift as a doorman at 10 East 96th Street .
2007_03_15_1833085	3	The sinkhole at the street end of his building 's canopy evolved from near-nothingness . ''
2007_03_15_1833085	4	It was a warp , '' he said . ''
2007_03_15_1833085	5	Then it started to grow . ''
2007_03_15_1833085	6	So he was '' Present at the Creation , '' but Dean Acheson , secretary of state in the Truman administration , had something else in mind when he wrote that book .
2007_03_15_1833085	7	Franz Joseph Haydn made an oratorio of '' The Creation , '' but that was about something larger than this sinkhole . ''
2007_03_15_1833085	8	I 'd say it 's a cab and a half long , '' said Eugene Cottrell , the superintendent at 8 East 96th Street .
2007_03_15_1833085	9	But this is New York , the world capital of bumper-to-bumper squeezes .
2007_03_15_1833085	10	This is why he immediately added , '' Two cabs if you 're a good parker . ''
2007_03_15_1833085	11	The pavement was cracked , like a layer cake with a firm top layer that has been attacked by a hungry eater .
2007_03_15_1833085	12	Or maybe the deep-down layer that shifts and cracks in an earthquake and is then pictured in a geology textbook that one only dimly remembers when contemplating an hours-old sinkhole from the sidewalk .
2007_03_15_1833085	13	As if the sinkhole were not large enough , workers with jackhammers arrived and enlarged it .
2007_03_15_1833085	14	They cut a bigger , more precise rectangle around the area .
2007_03_15_1833085	15	Mark Norton , who was visiting from Charlotte , N.C. , and staying with friends around the corner , described the process in a way that made it sound like what a dentist does , drilling away the decayed part of a tooth and a bit more .
2007_03_15_1833085	16	It was far , far shallower than the 330-foot-deep sinkhole that swallowed a dozen homes and killed two teenagers in Guatemala City last month .
2007_03_15_1833085	17	Nor was 96th Street fouled by odors or shaken by the tremors that accompanied that sinkhole .
2007_03_15_1833085	18	Anne Canty , a deputy commissioner of the city 's Department of Environmental Protection , the agency responsible for repairing the problem , said the cause of what she called the '' street collapse '' had not been determined , but it appeared to involve a sewer under 96th Street .
2007_03_15_1833085	19	Mr. Ieslam , the doorman , remembered seeing someone doing repairs a month ago in a manhole nearby . ''
2007_03_15_1833085	20	Maybe something spread underneath and this warp started , '' he said , '' or the thing that would start the warp started . ''
2007_03_15_1833086	0	As a T-Mobile subscriber , Ken Grunski , a businessman in San Diego , knew that his cellphone would work during a trip to Tanzania .
2007_03_15_1833086	1	What he did not expect was the bill : $ 800 for 10 days ' use . ''
2007_03_15_1833086	2	I did n't think I was going to use my phone that much , '' Mr. Grunski said . ''
2007_03_15_1833086	3	But two to three 10-minute calls a day , and it adds up . ''
2007_03_15_1833086	4	What a shame that Mr. Grunski did not heed his own company 's advice .
2007_03_15_1833086	5	If he had , he would have saved himself a bundle .
2007_03_15_1833086	6	Mr. Grunski owns Telestial , a company that sells SIM cards , small chips that replace those in cellphones sold by T-Mobile and Cingular and lower the costs of calls when overseas .
2007_03_15_1833086	7	While his American phone worked abroad without one , Mr. Grunski was paying sky-high rates because he was roaming in a foreign country .
2007_03_15_1833086	8	T-Mobile charged him $ 5 a minute to roam in Tanzania .
2007_03_15_1833086	9	If Mr. Grunski had used one of the SIM cards he sells , he would have paid $ 1.15 a minute to call the United States and his calls -- averaging 16 minutes a day -- would have cost him $ 184 , rather than $ 800 .
2007_03_15_1833086	10	While Americans have embraced the convenience of using cellphones , trying to dial from overseas often brings surprises .
2007_03_15_1833086	11	Even if the phone works , voice mail may not .
2007_03_15_1833086	12	Depending on the handset , coverage can be spotty .
2007_03_15_1833086	13	Make the wrong choices , and you may find a huge bill .
2007_03_15_1833086	14	The right tactics to avoid those headaches depend on which carrier you use , the length of your trip and your destination .
2007_03_15_1833086	15	GSM vs. CDMA A majority of the world 's cellphone subscribers -- 82 percent -- use the GSM technology standard , according to the GSM Association .
2007_03_15_1833086	16	In the United States , the major carriers use two systems .
2007_03_15_1833086	17	Cingular ( now AT&T ) and T-Mobile use GSM , while Sprint and Verizon use CDMA , an incompatible technology .
2007_03_15_1833086	18	CDMA technology is found in North America , as well as some Asian countries , but it is basically nonexistent in Europe , Australia and South Africa .
2007_03_15_1833086	19	As a result , Sprint and Verizon customers can use their phones in just 26 countries .
2007_03_15_1833086	20	( AT&T and T-Mobile customers can potentially use theirs in over a hundred . )
2007_03_15_1833086	21	When traveling in non-CDMA countries , Sprint and Verizon customers can rent or purchase GSM phones from those providers .
2007_03_15_1833086	22	Sprint rents a Motorola Razr for $ 58 for the first week , and $ 70 for two weeks , plus $ 1.29 to $ 4.99 a minute of airtime .
2007_03_15_1833086	23	Verizon charges $ 3.99 a day to rent , plus $ 1.49 to $ 4.99 a minute .
2007_03_15_1833086	24	Verizon also sells three combo CDMA-GSM models , priced from $ 150 to $ 600 with a two-year contract .
2007_03_15_1833086	25	Cingular and T-Mobile customers have more options -- if their existing phones can pick up multiple frequencies .
2007_03_15_1833086	26	To complicate matters , the American GSM standard operates on 850 and 1,900 megahertz , while the rest of the GSM world uses 900 and 1,800 megahertz .
2007_03_15_1833086	27	To use an American GSM cellphone in a foreign country , the handset you own must be tri-band or quad-band and able to operate on one or both of the frequencies used outside the United States .
2007_03_15_1833086	28	The Cingular and T-Mobile Web sites , as well as Telestial 's and others , list the predominant frequencies used in each country , and show if your phone can operate on one or both overseas bands .
2007_03_15_1833086	29	To protect against fraud , American cellphones are typically blocked from making calls when used abroad .
2007_03_15_1833086	30	Before traveling , call your provider and ask to have that restriction removed .
2007_03_15_1833086	31	A Temporary SIM Card GSM phones use SIM cards ( subscriber identity modules ) , tiny electronic chips that hold a cellphone 's '' brains , '' including the subscriber 's contact numbers and phone number .
2007_03_15_1833086	32	( CDMA phones store such information directly in the hardware . )
2007_03_15_1833086	33	GSM customers can avoid sky-high roaming charges by replacing their American SIM cards with ones from other countries .
2007_03_15_1833086	34	For example , travelers to Britain can pick up a SIM card from the British carrier Vodafone ; once inserted , it gives the phone a temporary British phone number .
2007_03_15_1833086	35	Calls within Britain and to the United States would be much cheaper .
2007_03_15_1833086	36	For example , T-Mobile charges its customers $ 1.99 a minute for using their phones in Britain , whether calling a pub in London or your home in New Jersey .
2007_03_15_1833086	37	Insert a prepaid British SIM card instead , and local calls drop to 26 cents a minute , while calls back to the United States cost 9 to 14 cents a minute .
2007_03_15_1833086	38	Another benefit when using overseas SIM cards is that incoming calls are typically free in most countries .
2007_03_15_1833086	39	Overseas SIM cards can be purchased before you travel from companies like Cellular Abroad ( www.cellularabroad.com ) and Telestial ( www.telestial.com ) or at local shops in foreign countries .
2007_03_15_1833086	40	Unlocking the Phone Even if you have a GSM phone that operates on both overseas frequencies , domestic cellphone providers do not want you to use your phone with another company 's SIM card , because they do not make any money when you do .
2007_03_15_1833086	41	To prevent your doing so , cellphones bought through Cingular and T-Mobile are electronically locked -- they accept only their own company 's SIM cards .
2007_03_15_1833086	42	Before you throw your phone off the Eiffel Tower in frustration , know that there are several ways to unlock your phone and avoid those high overseas roaming rates .
2007_03_15_1833086	43	Cingular and T-Mobile will unlock their customers ' phones under certain conditions .
2007_03_15_1833086	44	Cingular will provide unlock codes to customers whose contracts have expired , who have canceled their service and paid an early termination fee , or who have paid a full rather than subsidized price for their phones , according to Rich Blasi , a Cingular Wireless spokesman .
2007_03_15_1833086	45	T-Mobile has more lenient policies .
2007_03_15_1833086	46	It will provide the unlock code to any customer after 90 days of service , but no more than one unlock code will be provided every 90 days , said Graham Crow , a T-Mobile spokesman .
2007_03_15_1833086	47	If you do not meet these requirements , you can still get your phone unlocked from a private company .
2007_03_15_1833086	48	For a few dollars , the Travel Insider ( www.thetravelinsider.com ) and UnlockTelecom ( www.unlocktelecom.co.uk ) will provide your phone 's specific unlocking code .
2007_03_15_1833086	49	Other GSM Phones Cellphone customers with dual-band GSM phones that can not be used overseas can always purchase unlocked quad-band phones from third-party providers .
2007_03_15_1833086	50	These phones can be used solely when traveling outside the United States .
2007_03_15_1833086	51	Since they are unlocked , they can also be used instead of your current phone on your American network .
2007_03_15_1833086	52	Because the phone is not subsidized by a carrier , the price is higher .
2007_03_15_1833086	53	For example , an unlocked quad-band Motorola Razr V3 can be bought for $ 140 from Cellular Blowout ( www.cellular-blowout.com ) .
2007_03_15_1833086	54	Cellular Abroad and Telestial also sell unlocked phones .
2007_03_15_1833086	55	A Few More Tips When entering numbers in your phone , always add the plus ( + ) sign and the country code ; that way , the number can be dialed automatically no matter from what country you are calling .
2007_03_15_1833086	56	Store your GSM phone 's numbers in the phone itself , rather than the SIM card .
2007_03_15_1833086	57	Then the numbers will still be available to you when you use an overseas SIM card .
2007_03_15_1833086	58	To transfer them to a new phone easily , store them on a device like Backup-Pal ( www.backup-pal.com ) , an external U.S.B. memory unit .
2007_03_15_1833086	59	While you will not pay any charges for incoming calls when you use a foreign SIM card , tell your American callers to get an overseas calling plan from their phone company before you ask them to ring you .
2007_03_15_1833086	60	If they do not , they could be paying the same sky-high rates that you just avoided .
2007_03_15_1833086	61	And if you take your American phone overseas , make sure that its battery charger is dual voltage ; without one , all the effort to get your phone to work in other countries may go up in smoke the first time you plug it in .
2007_03_15_1833086	62	CIRCUITS Correction : March 17 , 2007 , Saturday An article in the Circuits pages of Business Day on Thursday about using cellphones overseas misstated the charge to T-Mobile USA customers for placing a call in Britain .
2007_03_15_1833086	63	It is 99 cents a minute , not $ 1.99 .
2007_03_15_1833086	64	The article also referred incorrectly to the status of CDMA cellphone technology in Australia .
2007_03_15_1833086	65	While CDMA phones from American carriers do not operate there , other CDMA phones are in use ; they are not '' basically nonexistent . ''
2007_03_15_1833086	66	And the article also referred incompletely to a source of low rates for calls from Britain .
2007_03_15_1833086	67	The rates -- 26 cents a minute for local calls and 9 to 14 cents a minute for calls to the United States -- are available with use of a SIM card sold by Telestial .
2007_03_15_1833087	0	WHILE New York State does not subscribe to the death penalty for the moment , the federal government does .
2007_03_15_1833087	1	Over the last few years there has been a surge in death penalty prosecutions authorized by the United States attorney general , both nationwide and in federal cases in New York .
2007_03_15_1833087	2	But these have resulted in disproportionately few death penalty verdicts , at enormous costs and burdens to the judicial system .
2007_03_15_1833087	3	A more prudent and realistic approach in the way the government seeks the death penalty is warranted .
2007_03_15_1833087	4	Federal death penalty prosecutions reappeared in 1988 , and since 1990 the attorneys general have authorized 416 prosecutions nationwide : 180 during the 1990s , an average of 18 per year ; and 236 from 2000 to the present , a jump to almost 40 per year .
2007_03_15_1833087	5	In New York State , 12 were authorized during the 1990s ; since then , 30 more .
2007_03_15_1833087	6	Given the time required to prepare and defend against a death penalty prosecution , many of those cases have yet to be tried .
2007_03_15_1833087	7	Of those that have been tried , 50 resulted in death penalty verdicts .
2007_03_15_1833087	8	But because of the long judicial review process before someone is put to death , there have been only three federal executions , the most notable being Timothy McVeigh 's .
2007_03_15_1833087	9	( One benefit of this protracted process is that 197 state death row inmates have been exonerated . )
2007_03_15_1833087	10	In New York , 17 of the authorized cases have been tried , but only one death penalty verdict returned -- the recent case against Ronell Wilson , convicted of murdering two police officers .
2007_03_15_1833087	11	In the Eastern District of New York ( covering Brooklyn , Queens , Staten Island and Nassau and Suffolk Counties ) , where I am a judge , there were three death penalty trials from 1990 to 2005 .
2007_03_15_1833087	12	That number was already matched this year , and there are six more cases scheduled for trial .
2007_03_15_1833087	13	What have all these death penalty prosecutions cost the taxpayers , who pay for both defense -- the Constitution guarantees the right to counsel for those who , as is usually the case , ca n't afford it -- and prosecution ?
2007_03_15_1833087	14	I recently presided over a trial in which the jury quickly rejected the death penalty .
2007_03_15_1833087	15	The vouchers submitted by the defense alone exceeded $ 500,000 .
2007_03_15_1833087	16	Assuming the cost of prosecution to be at least equal ( efforts to obtain that figure from the Department of Justice were unavailing ) , $ 1 million would be a fair estimate for the trial alone .
2007_03_15_1833087	17	Had there been a death verdict , an appeal would have added many more dollars .
2007_03_15_1833087	18	Thus , we have probably spent more than $ 17 million on the 17 federal death penalty trials in New York State , with one death verdict to show for it .
2007_03_15_1833087	19	And taxpayers will be footing the $ 9 million bill for the nine death penalty cases in the Eastern District .
2007_03_15_1833087	20	All this as the federal judicial system is struggling with unprecedented budget cuts .
2007_03_15_1833087	21	In the Eastern District , some 25 assistant United States attorney positions remain unfilled , presumably contributing to a marked reduction ( 38 percent from 2003 to 2005 ) in criminal filings .
2007_03_15_1833087	22	The Probation Department 's budget has been cut by $ 680,000 from the last fiscal year ( making it harder to keep tabs on former inmates requiring supervision ) , and Pre-Trial Services ' by almost $ 100,000 ( making it harder to supervise those on bail awaiting trial ) .
2007_03_15_1833087	23	And while the Marshals Service has been called upon to provide additional resources and security to handle the surfeit of death penalty cases , its operating budget , exclusive of salaries , has been cut by about 32 percent , from $ 549,000 to $ 375,000 .
2007_03_15_1833087	24	During the death penalty case I recently presided over , I was told that the Marshals Service had no funds to provide security for the jurors , requiring money to be taken initially from the court 's budget .
2007_03_15_1833087	25	Costs are not the only concern .
2007_03_15_1833087	26	The nine cases in my court this year have been distributed among the court 's 24 judges .
2007_03_15_1833087	27	It takes about three weeks to select a jury qualified for a death penalty case , and months to try the case ; judges will therefore be less available for other judicial work .
2007_03_15_1833087	28	Similarly , a death penalty prosecution depletes the resources of the prosecutor 's office , making it more difficult to attend to the backlog of cases that do n't involve the death penalty .
2007_03_15_1833087	29	What should be done ?
2007_03_15_1833087	30	In 1995 , Judge Alex Kozinski of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit , who is highly regarded by the conservative Federalist Society and who is not opposed to the death penalty , gave a speech at Case Western Reserve University of Law in which he noted that '' the number of executions compared to the number of people who have been sentenced to death is minuscule '' and concluded that '' whatever purposes the death penalty is said to serve -- deterrence , retribution , assuaging the pain suffered by victims ' families -- those purposes are not served by the system as it now operates . ''
2007_03_15_1833087	31	Judge Kozinski added that the costs of death penalty prosecutions far outweighed the results , and that because of the proliferation of such prosecutions '' there would have to be one execution every day for the next 26 years '' to handle the volume .
2007_03_15_1833087	32	He recommended that death penalty prosecutions should only be brought against '' the most depraved killers . ''
2007_03_15_1833087	33	This , he said , would ensure that we convict only as many people as '' we truly have the means and the will to execute '' and that '' the few who suffer the death penalty really are the worst of the very bad -- mass murderers , hired killers , terrorists . ''
2007_03_15_1833087	34	I find myself in agreement with my colleague , whose observations have come home to roost .
2007_03_15_1833087	35	But before we can effect change , we must understand how cases become death penalty prosecutions .
2007_03_15_1833087	36	In 1972 , in the landmark case of Furman v. Georgia , the Supreme Court declared unconstitutional all capital punishment statutes that provided unguided and unchecked discretion to jurors in deciding who should live or die .
2007_03_15_1833087	37	This effectively invalidated all existing federal death penalties .
2007_03_15_1833087	38	Federal death penalty prosecutions lay dormant until 1988 , when Congress enacted detailed constitutional procedures ; at that time , only drug-related homicides were eligible for the death penalty .
2007_03_15_1833087	39	In 1994 , a year before Judge Kozinski 's speech , Congress enacted the Federal Death Penalty Act , which , by the Department of Justice 's count , added the possibility of the death penalty for 60 more offenses under 13 existing and 28 new statutes .
2007_03_15_1833087	40	With the federal government back in the business of death penalty prosecutions , the critical task of selecting whom to prosecute was given to the attorney general : an internal Attorney General 's Review Committee on Capital Cases makes a recommendation to the attorney general ( after receiving the local United States attorney 's recommendation and submissions from defense counsel ) , who then makes the final decision .
2007_03_15_1833087	41	Therefore , it is incumbent on the attorney general , in discharging his awesome responsibility , to heed Judge Kozinski 's advice that the death penalty should only be for the most depraved killers .
2007_03_15_1833087	42	He should also note Justice Clarence Thomas 's observation , writing for the Supreme Court majority in a capital case , that the government has '' a strong interest in having the jury express the conscience of the community on the ultimate question of life or death . ''
2007_03_15_1833087	43	In convicting Mr. Wilson and rejecting the death penalty in all of the other 16 death penalty cases , New Yorkers have sent a clear signal to the attorney general : He should be more circumspect and realistic in authorizing death penalty prosecutions , lest the judicial system be overwhelmed , the community 's will ignored and taxpayer dollars improvidently spent .
2007_03_15_1833087	44	Op-Ed Contributor Frederic Block is a judge for the United States District Court in Brooklyn .
2007_03_15_1833087	45	Correction : March 17 , 2007 , Saturday An Op-Ed article on Thursday , about the cost of death penalty cases , misstated the number of state death row inmates who have been exonerated .
2007_03_15_1833087	46	Since 1973 , 123 have been exonerated , according to the Death Penalty Information Center , not 197 .
2007_03_15_1833088	0	Senator Carl Levin has always been one of the most serious participants in the Iraq debate .
2007_03_15_1833088	1	He 's one of those politicians who could actually pass a test of Middle East cultural literacy -- who could tell you what the Mahdi Army is or whether Al Qaeda is a Sunni or Shiite organization .
2007_03_15_1833088	2	He 's one of the Democrats who generally has n't formed his Iraq position with an eye to Iowa primary voters or the party 's donor base .
2007_03_15_1833088	3	Which is why it 's significant that his speeches during yesterday 's Senate war debate were so utterly unconvincing .
2007_03_15_1833088	4	The essential Levin argument was that the Iraqi leaders have been shirking their duties and it 's time to force them to get serious . ''
2007_03_15_1833088	5	It is time for Congress to explain to the Iraqis that it is your country , '' Levin declared .
2007_03_15_1833088	6	It is time to shift responsibility for Iraq firmly onto Iraqi shoulders , and give them the incentives they need to make the tough choices .
2007_03_15_1833088	7	The Democratic timetable resolution , Levin concluded , '' will deliver a cold dose of reality to Iraqi leaders . ''
2007_03_15_1833088	8	But does anybody think that Iraqi leaders , many of whom have seen their brothers and children gunned down , need a cold dose of reality delivered from the U.S. Congress ?
2007_03_15_1833088	9	Does anybody buy the Levin model of reality , which holds that Iraqi leaders are rational game theorists who just need to have their incentives rearranged in order to make peace ?
2007_03_15_1833088	10	Does anybody believe the rifts in Iraqi society can be bridged by a few '' tough choices '' made by the largely reviled Green Zone politicians ?
2007_03_15_1833088	11	The Democrats spent three years attacking the Bush administration for ignoring intelligence , but now they 're making the Republicans look like pikers .
2007_03_15_1833088	12	In this debate , they have rigorously ignored the latest intelligence estimates , which take a much deeper , more organic view of Iraqi reality than the technocratic , top-down approach Levin was articulating Wednesday afternoon .
2007_03_15_1833088	13	The intelligence agencies paint a portrait of a society riven at its base with sectarian passion .
2007_03_15_1833088	14	They describe a society not of rational game theorists but of human beings beset by trauma -- of Sunnis failing to acknowledge their minority status , of Shiites bent on winner-take-all domination , of self-perpetuating animosities , disintegrating bonds and a complex weave of conflicts .
2007_03_15_1833088	15	The intelligence agencies see chaos if the U.S. withdraws .
2007_03_15_1833088	16	Carl Levin , based on phantom intelligence , sees newly incentivized Iraqis returning to reason and moderation .
2007_03_15_1833088	17	The fact is there are two serious approaches to U.S. policy in Iraq , and the Democratic leaders , for purely political reasons , are caught in the middle , and even people like Carl Levin are beginning to sound silly .
2007_03_15_1833088	18	One serious position is heard on the left : that there 's nothing more we can effectively do in Iraq .
2007_03_15_1833088	19	We 've spent four years there and have not been able to quell the violence .
2007_03_15_1833088	20	If the place is headed for civil war , there 's nothing we can do to stop it , and we certainly do n't want to get caught in the middle .
2007_03_15_1833088	21	The only reasonable option is to get out now before more Americans die .
2007_03_15_1833088	22	The second serious option is heard on the right .
2007_03_15_1833088	23	We have to do everything we can to head off catastrophe , and it 's too soon to give up hope .
2007_03_15_1833088	24	The surge is already producing some results .
2007_03_15_1833088	25	Bombing deaths are down by at least a third .

2007_03_15_1833088	27	An oil agreement has been reached , tribes in Anbar Province are chasing Al Qaeda , cross-sectarian political blocs are emerging .
2007_03_15_1833088	28	We should perhaps build on the promise of the surge with regional diplomacy or a soft partition , but we certainly should not set timetables for withdrawal .
2007_03_15_1833088	29	The Democratic leaders do n't want to be for immediate withdrawal because it might alienate the centrists , and they do n't want to see out the surge because that would alienate the base .
2007_03_15_1833088	30	What they want to do is be against Bush without accepting responsibility for any real policy , so they have concocted a vaporous policy of distant withdrawal that is divorced from realities on the ground .
2007_03_15_1833088	31	Say what you will about President Bush , when he thinks a policy is right , like the surge , he supports it , even if it 's going to be unpopular .
2007_03_15_1833088	32	The Democratic leaders , accustomed to the irresponsibility of opposition , show no such guts .
2007_03_15_1833088	33	As a result , nobody loves them .

2007_03_15_1833088	37	What we get is foreign policy narcissism .

2007_03_15_1833089	0	The national unemployment rate came in at 4.5 percent last week and was generally characterized as pretty good .
2007_03_15_1833089	1	But whatever universe those numbers came from , it was not the universe that black men live in .
2007_03_15_1833089	2	Black American males inhabit a universe in which joblessness is frequently the norm , where the idea of getting up each morning and going off to work can seem stranger to a lot of men than the dream of hitting the lottery , where the dignity that comes from supporting oneself and one 's family has too often been replaced by a numbing sense of hopelessness .
2007_03_15_1833089	3	What I 'm talking about is extreme joblessness -- joblessness that is coursing through communities and being passed from one generation to another , like a deadly virus .
2007_03_15_1833089	4	Forget , for a moment , the official unemployment numbers .
2007_03_15_1833089	5	They understate the problem of joblessness for all groups .
2007_03_15_1833089	6	Far more telling is the actual percentage of people in a given segment of the working-age population that is jobless .
2007_03_15_1833089	7	Black men who graduate from a four-year college do reasonably well in terms of employment , compared with other ethnic groups .
2007_03_15_1833089	8	But most black men do not go to college .
2007_03_15_1833089	9	In big cities , more than half do not even finish high school .
2007_03_15_1833089	10	Their employment histories are gruesome .
2007_03_15_1833089	11	Over the past few years , the percentage of black male high school graduates in their 20s who were jobless ( including those who abandoned all efforts to find a job ) has ranged from well over a third to roughly 50 percent .
2007_03_15_1833089	12	Those are the kinds of statistics you get during a depression .
2007_03_15_1833089	13	For dropouts , the rates of joblessness are staggering .
2007_03_15_1833089	14	For black males who left high school without a diploma , the real jobless rate at various times over the past few years has ranged from 59 percent to a breathtaking 72 percent . ''
2007_03_15_1833089	15	Seventy-two percent jobless ! ''
2007_03_15_1833089	16	said Senator Charles Schumer , chairman of Congress 's Joint Economic Committee , which held a hearing last week on joblessness among black men . ''
2007_03_15_1833089	17	This compares to 29 percent of white and 19 percent of Hispanic dropouts . ''
2007_03_15_1833089	18	Senator Schumer described the problem of black male unemployment as '' profound , persistent and perplexing . ''
2007_03_15_1833089	19	Jobless rates at such sky-high levels do n't just destroy lives , they destroy entire communities .
2007_03_15_1833089	20	They breed all manner of antisocial behavior , including violent crime .
2007_03_15_1833089	21	One of the main reasons there are so few black marriages is that there are so many black men who are financially incapable of supporting a family . ''
2007_03_15_1833089	22	These numbers should generate a sense of national alarm , '' said Senator Schumer .
2007_03_15_1833089	23	However much this epidemic of joblessness may hurt , very little is being done about it .
2007_03_15_1833089	24	According to the Labor Department , only 97,000 new jobs were created in February .
2007_03_15_1833089	25	That 's not even enough to accommodate new entrants to the work force .
2007_03_15_1833089	26	And then there 's the question of who 's getting the new jobs .
2007_03_15_1833089	27	According to statistics compiled by the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University in Boston , the only groups that have experienced a growth in jobs since the last recession are older workers and immigrants .
2007_03_15_1833089	28	People can howl all they want about how well the economy is doing .
2007_03_15_1833089	29	The simple truth is that millions of ordinary American workers are in an employment bind .
2007_03_15_1833089	30	Steady jobs with good benefits are going the way of Ozzie and Harriet .
2007_03_15_1833089	31	Young workers , especially , are hurting , which diminishes the prospects for the American family .
2007_03_15_1833089	32	And blacks , particularly black males , are in a deep danger zone .
2007_03_15_1833089	33	Instead of addressing this issue constructively , government officials have responded by eviscerating programs that were designed to move young people from disadvantaged backgrounds into the labor market .
2007_03_15_1833089	34	Robert Carmona , president of Strive , an organization that helps build job skills , told Senator Schumer 's committee , '' What we 've seen over the last several years is a deliberate disinvestment in programs that do work . ''
2007_03_15_1833089	35	What 's needed are massive programs of job training and job creation , and a sustained national effort to bolster the education backgrounds of disadvantaged youngsters .
2007_03_15_1833089	36	So far there has been no political will to do any of that .
2007_03_15_1833089	37	You get lip service .
2007_03_15_1833089	38	But when you walk into the neighborhoods and talk to the young people , you find that very little , if anything , is being done .
2007_03_15_1833089	39	Which is why the real-world employment environment has become so horrendous for so many .
2007_03_15_1833091	0	A screaming baby girl has been forcibly weaned from breast milk and taken , dehydrated , to an emergency room , so that the nation 's borders will be secure .
2007_03_15_1833091	1	Her mother and more than 300 other workers in a leather-goods factory in New Bedford , Mass. , have been terrorized -- subdued by guns and dogs , their children stranded at school -- so that the country will notice that the Bush administration is serious about enforcing immigration laws .
2007_03_15_1833091	2	Meanwhile , tens of thousands of poor Americans , lacking the right citizenship papers , have been denied a doctor 's care so that not a penny of Medicaid will go to a sick illegal immigrant .
2007_03_15_1833091	3	As the country waits for Congress and the president to enact immigration reform , the indecency of existing policies is becoming intolerable .
2007_03_15_1833091	4	The immigrant underclass is in a growing state of misery and fear .
2007_03_15_1833091	5	States and localities have rushed to fill the vacuum of Congressional inaction with a jumble of enforcement regimes .
2007_03_15_1833091	6	Farmers are worrying about crops rotting as their immigrant workers retreat further into the shadows .
2007_03_15_1833091	7	Officials in Colorado have settled on one solution : replacing those workers with prison chain gangs .
2007_03_15_1833091	8	Senator Edward Kennedy , infuriated after visiting a New Bedford church basement and hearing tales of separated families and sick children , has given up on drafting a new immigration bill .
2007_03_15_1833091	9	He has decided instead to get Congress moving quickly by reintroducing a bill passed last year by the Senate Judiciary Committee .
2007_03_15_1833091	10	That bill -- sponsored by Senator Arlen Specter , then the committee 's chairman -- was seriously flawed to start and further distorted by harsh Republican amendments .
2007_03_15_1833091	11	Mr. Kennedy clearly believes that the urgent priority is to get the bipartisan coalition for immigration reform back on the bus and to fix problems while the bus is moving .
2007_03_15_1833091	12	His frustrations are understandable , but he will have to work hard to make sure that he and the bill do not compromise too much .
2007_03_15_1833091	13	And there is a lot in the Specter bill to be concerned about .
2007_03_15_1833091	14	Parts of it were cut and pasted from a cruel immigration bill that passed the House , including draconian measures to speed immigrants ' deportation and deny them protection in the courts .
2007_03_15_1833091	15	It came with an arbitrary cutoff date , leaving anyone who arrived here illegally after 2004 in the cold .
2007_03_15_1833091	16	What is urgently needed is decency , proportionality and bipartisanship to resolve this festering debate .
2007_03_15_1833091	17	Whenever and however the Senate revisits immigration , the bottom line must be the same : a bill that combines border security and workplace enforcement with diligent protection of workers ' rights and a path to citizenship for immigrants who work for it .
2007_03_15_1833091	18	The alternative , the blundering and punitive status quo , is a path of misery .
2007_03_15_1833092	0	The annual session of China 's National People 's Congress , now concluding , is not quite the ritual of absolute fealty it used to be .
2007_03_15_1833092	1	Reporters get to chase delegates in the hallways , and insiders say there have been some lively debates in the closed sessions .
2007_03_15_1833092	2	Still , the two-week gathering of 2,980 carefully vetted delegates remained largely a choreographed show to put the stamp of legality on decisions already made .
2007_03_15_1833092	3	And just so democracy did n't get out of hand , authorities warned some dissidents to steer clear of foreign journalists while the congress was meeting and put others under house arrest .
2007_03_15_1833092	4	The decisions up for ratification included a major new property law that would give private property greater security by putting it on a legal par with public ownership .
2007_03_15_1833092	5	If the Communist leaders are willing to put aside ideology to continue their remarkable economic boom , why not take another essential step and make the congress a real legislature that listens to the unmuzzled views of real people ?
2007_03_15_1833092	6	And follow that up with an independent -- and uncorrupted -- judiciary that can make sure that all of China 's citizens get the benefits of the rule of law .
2007_03_15_1833092	7	An early draft of the property law provoked an acrimonious debate between ideologues , for whom property rights are heresy , and the growing moneyed class , which wants to protect its assets .
2007_03_15_1833092	8	It is also not clear whether the current version will adequately address the expropriation of collectively owned land from peasants for development -- one of the biggest sources of rural unrest .
2007_03_15_1833092	9	In his two-hour opening speech to the congress , Prime Minister Wen Jiabao proclaimed the government 's intention to '' pay closer attention to promoting social development and improving people 's well-being . ''
2007_03_15_1833092	10	But even if the laws rubber-stamped by the congress do reflect a greater sensitivity to one part of public opinion -- those who are driving the boom -- they are the product of an authoritarian leadership that still holds itself above the law and the muzzled majority of the population .
2007_03_15_1833092	11	The conflicts revealed by the property law are not simply growing pains of a red-hot economy , as China 's leaders would have it , to be resolved by shifting perks or property rights .
2007_03_15_1833092	12	They are the conflicts of a changing society that can be worked out only in full and open debate -- in the press , on the Internet , in a real courtroom and by a real congress .
2007_03_15_1833093	0	So far , the housing bust has been mainly about subprime lenders going broke , bankers and investors trying to avoid the fallout , and regulators rousing -- too late , apparently -- from hibernation .
2007_03_15_1833093	1	The story yet to unfold involves the millions of American families who are in danger of losing their homes .
2007_03_15_1833093	2	Last December , the nonpartisan Center for Responsible Lending estimated that 1.7 million homeowners were in harm 's way .
2007_03_15_1833093	3	Fresh evidence of a meltdown -- from the Mortgage Bankers Association -- suggests that estimate may be too low .
2007_03_15_1833093	4	The association reported this week that the share of mortgages entering the foreclosure process in the last quarter of 2006 was at its highest level since the group began keeping track 37 years ago .
2007_03_15_1833093	5	Borrowers with subprime loans have been hardest hit , but all major loan types have been affected , as the housing market weakens amid upward adjustments in monthly payments on many mortgages .
2007_03_15_1833093	6	The personal tragedy is only the start .
2007_03_15_1833093	7	Borrowers presently faced with losing their homes stand to lose $ 164 billion of wealth in the process .
2007_03_15_1833093	8	Whole communities pay the price .
2007_03_15_1833093	9	Foreclosures tend to cluster in neighborhoods , leading to sharp declines in property values , business investment and tax revenues .
2007_03_15_1833093	10	Responding to the mortgage bankers ' grim report , Senator Christopher Dodd , chairman of the Banking Committee and a presidential hopeful , broached the possibility of federal help for struggling homeowners .
2007_03_15_1833093	11	The most plausible relief measures -- detailed in a new report by the Center for American Progress , a liberal research and advocacy group -- involve federal boosts to existing state and local programs .
2007_03_15_1833093	12	Those include counseling to help strapped families plan for rising monthly payments and renegotiate their loans , legal aid and short-term loans for eligible borrowers .
2007_03_15_1833093	13	One study shows that a federal grant of $ 25 million could replicate proven local programs in other areas now experiencing spikes in foreclosures .
2007_03_15_1833093	14	Mr. Dodd and his fellow lawmakers could be particularly effective at this stage in framing the case for federal help .
2007_03_15_1833093	15	Relief would be a cost-effective , humane response to homeowners trapped by complex , unmanageable -- and , in a growing number of cases , seemingly predatory -- loans .
2007_03_15_1833093	16	Time and resources to renegotiate those loans or sell an unaffordable property could save many families and communities from calamity .
2007_03_15_1833094	0	There 's a good reason that military officers avoid commenting on politics , society and public policy .
2007_03_15_1833094	1	The results are usually bad .
2007_03_15_1833094	2	Consider the offensive comments that Gen. Peter Pace , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , made this week about gay people .
2007_03_15_1833094	3	They carried a special measure of hurt coming from the nation 's highest military officer when thousands of gay men and lesbians are serving their country in Iraq .
2007_03_15_1833094	4	By refusing to apologize , General Pace compounded the injury and reminded the entire country of what happened the last time the top brass took on this subject .
2007_03_15_1833094	5	It was Gen. Colin Powell 's public rebuke of a new president , Bill Clinton , for even entertaining the idea of allowing homosexuals to serve openly that led to the '' do n't ask , do n't tell '' policy .
2007_03_15_1833094	6	It is a bad system , which has ruined people 's lives and hurt the military , but it still is the policy , established by General Pace 's civilian bosses , and it allows gay people to serve as long as they do n't say anything about their orientation .
2007_03_15_1833094	7	Which made it all the more offensive to read that General Pace told the editorial board of The Chicago Tribune that he believes homosexuality is an intolerable immoral act equivalent to adultery .
2007_03_15_1833094	8	Instead of apologizing , General Pace later said his mistake was focusing his comments on his view of morality instead of on military policy .
2007_03_15_1833094	9	General Pace is wrong in every way , and out of step .
2007_03_15_1833094	10	An increasing number of Americans in and out of the military now recognize that the current policy is indefensible .
2007_03_15_1833094	11	Those Americans include Gen. John Shalikashvili , who was chairman of the Joint Chiefs when the benighted policy was adopted .
2007_03_15_1833094	12	In an Op-Ed article in this newspaper in January , General Shalikashvili wrote that conversations with gay soldiers and marines had showed him '' that gays and lesbians can be accepted by their peers . ''
2007_03_15_1833094	13	General Pace should still apologize for his remarks , forthrightly .
2007_03_15_1833094	14	Then perhaps some good could come out of his bigoted remarks if they added to the growing movement on Capitol Hill to finally allow gay men and lesbians to serve openly in the military .

2007_03_15_1833098	1	Union-organizing efforts often start with employees ' being pressured to sign cards by union organizers .
2007_03_15_1833098	2	As evidenced by the outcome of the elections , not all card-signing employees vote for the union .
2007_03_15_1833098	3	Employees will sign cards to appear sympathetic to the union with the knowledge that they can express their true opinions by secret ballot .
2007_03_15_1833098	4	And some will sign cards out of respect for their co-workers ' right to an election while remaining opposed to organizing the workplace .
2007_03_15_1833098	5	The process of union organizing may need repair , but the secret ballot should be maintained as a democratic means of expressing the employees ' true intentions .

2007_03_15_1833100	0	To the Editor : Re '' ` Mistakes ' Made on Prosecutors , Gonzales Admits '' ( front page , March 14 ) : The latest case of the White House 's being caught in the middle of a campaign to punish its political opponents serves only to illustrate how inappropriately and blatantly this administration will act to further its agenda .
2007_03_15_1833100	1	The popular wisdom dictates that the Justice Department should always remain above party politics and independent of the administration in power .
2007_03_15_1833100	2	When this relationship is shown to be one involving joint efforts of political manipulation and acts of coercion against United States attorneys , the integrity and the reputation of the Justice Department and its leadership are seriously compromised .
2007_03_15_1833100	3	Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales must resign if the Justice Department has any chance of regaining its place as a trusted and apolitical stalwart of our government .
2007_03_15_1833100	4	Whether he knew about the e-mail messages and other communication between the White House and his department is irrelevant .
2007_03_15_1833100	5	Simply the fact that these illicit actions occurred on his watch is reason enough that he should step down and allow a new attorney general without the type of close ties to the administration that Mr. Gonzales brought to the job be appointed by President Bush and approved by the Senate .
2007_03_15_1833100	6	If the Justice Department continues to be led by Mr. Gonzales and his team , the only logical scenario will include a series of hearings and investigations that will undoubtedly result in a weakened and dangerously hampered department unable to focus on its vitally important goals and objectives .
2007_03_15_1833100	7	The American people deserve a Justice Department that can function the way it should rather than with one arm tied behind its political back .
2007_03_15_1833100	8	Alan Safron Woodcliff Lake , N.J. March 14 , 2007 To the Editor : So Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales agrees that '' mistakes were made '' in the dismissal of federal prosecutors .
2007_03_15_1833100	9	Well , how about unmaking those mistakes , by hiring those prosecutors back ?
2007_03_15_1833100	10	Piri Halasz New York , March 14 , 2007 To the Editor : Where was the outrage when Janet Reno dismissed all 93 United States attorneys when President Bill Clinton took office in 1993 ?
2007_03_15_1833100	11	Peter Alperin San Francisco , March 14 , 2007 To the Editor : Once again , a senior member of the Bush administration pleads ignorance .
2007_03_15_1833100	12	Knowing nothing of the dismissal of United States attorneys , our attorney general apparently feels that ignorance is bliss .
2007_03_15_1833100	13	Consider , however : A commanding general interviews two of his senior officers after a lost battle .
2007_03_15_1833100	14	The first tells him , '' I moved slowly , I mismanaged my troops , I made mistakes , I got beat . ''
2007_03_15_1833100	15	The second officer says : '' Battle ?
2007_03_15_1833100	16	There was a battle ? ''
2007_03_15_1833100	17	Which officer would be kept on ?
2007_03_15_1833100	18	David Gustafson Hopkins , Minn. , March 14 , 2007 To the Editor : You quote Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales as saying , '' I acknowledge that mistakes were made here , '' and proceed to characterize his statement as a mea culpa .
2007_03_15_1833100	19	Where is the '' mea '' in this culpa ?
2007_03_15_1833100	20	Steven M. Wenner Longmeadow , Mass. .
2007_03_15_1833100	21	March 14 , 2007 To the Editor : Re '' Politics , Pure and Cynical '' ( editorial , March 14 ) : I must give credit to the Bush administration for one thing : getting me to start agreeing with New York Times editorials .
2007_03_15_1833100	22	I also note , as you do , that if the Bush administration had had its way , Harriet E. Miers , the White House participant in this political hatchet job , would now be sitting on the Supreme Court .
2007_03_15_1833100	23	Alberto R. Gonzales as attorney general ?
2007_03_15_1833100	24	Harriet Miers on the Supreme Court ?
2007_03_15_1833100	25	Two utterly unqualified people for two of the most important positions in the law .
2007_03_15_1833100	26	Donald Nawi Scarsdale , N.Y. , March 14 , 2007 To the Editor : Re '' Familiar Fallback for Officials : ` Mistakes Were Made ' '' ( news article , March 14 ) : Your history of how politicians have carefully avoided saying '' I made a mistake '' was a delight !
2007_03_15_1833100	27	I especially enjoyed the reference to a new tense , the '' past exonerative . ''
2007_03_15_1833100	28	I am well into my 80s and I have seen many politicians come and go .
2007_03_15_1833100	29	There is a special place in my heart for a politician from my youth , Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia of New York , the man we lovingly called '' The Little Flower . ''
2007_03_15_1833100	30	Mayor La Guardia once said , '' When I make a mistake , it 's a beaut ! ''
2007_03_15_1833100	31	How refreshing it would be for someone -- for example , one of our candidates for president -- to borrow that memorable phrase for a campaign speech !

2007_03_15_1833101	0	To the Editor : Re '' Another Warning on Warming '' ( editorial , March 11 ) : Anyone who still has any doubts about the problem of pollution and global warming need only visit China .
2007_03_15_1833101	1	Two weeks ago , I spent five days in eastern China , from Shanghai to Beijing .
2007_03_15_1833101	2	The air pollution was staggering .
2007_03_15_1833101	3	Not once did I see the sun or clouds or even a hint of blue sky .
2007_03_15_1833101	4	Instead , the entire skyline was a murky , hazy , ugly gray .
2007_03_15_1833101	5	The way it looks sometimes when it 's about to rain , yet there was no precipitation .
2007_03_15_1833101	6	I thought that I was on another planet , one with a different atmosphere from the Earth 's .
2007_03_15_1833101	7	When I returned to the United States , the first thing I did was to run outside to see the blue sky again .
2007_03_15_1833101	8	This can not be the legacy we wish to leave our children .
2007_03_15_1833101	9	Robert M. Miller New York , March 11 , 2007
2007_03_15_1833102	0	Following are excerpts from the interview on Tuesday with Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton about Iraq : I think we have a remaining military as well as political mission , trying to contain the extremists .
2007_03_15_1833102	1	I think we have a vital national security interest and obligation to try to help the Kurds manage their various problems in the north so that one of our allies , Turkey , is not inflamed , and they are able to continue with their autonomy .
2007_03_15_1833102	2	I think we have a vital national security interest -- if the Iraqis ever get their act together -- to continue to provide logistical support , air support , training support .
2007_03_15_1833102	3	I do n't know that that is going to be feasible , but I would certainly entertain it .
2007_03_15_1833102	4	And I think we have a remaining vital national security interest in trying to prevent Iran from crossing the border and having too much influence inside Iraq .
2007_03_15_1833102	5	And so it will be up to me to try to figure out how to protect those national security interests and continue to take our troops out of this urban warfare , which I think is a loser , and I do not believe that it can be successful .
2007_03_15_1833102	6	If we had done it right from the beginning , we might have had a fighting chance .
2007_03_15_1833102	7	We did not , and I think it is beyond our control now .
2007_03_15_1833102	8	But what we can do is to almost take a line sort of north of -- between Baghdad and Kirkuk , and basically put our troops into that region , the ones that are going to remain for our antiterrorism mission , for our northern support mission , for our ability to respond to the Iranians , and to continue to provide support , if called for , for the Iraqis .
2007_03_15_1833102	9	One of the things that I would hope to be able to do is to be able to get the unvarnished , honest opinions of a lot of the people who would have to make these decisions and fulfill these missions .
2007_03_15_1833102	10	I 've had enough private conversations with enough generals and colonels and captains , that there is a lot of dissension about what we 're doing and how we 're doing it and how successful we can be doing it .
2007_03_15_1833102	11	And I think we 've got to try to strip out the ideology and the particular passions of our current leadership and try to take a very unvarnished look at where we are and what it would take to try to achieve any of these missions over a reasonable period of time .
2007_03_15_1833102	12	If there is not any political resolution , the civil war will continue , and we need to get out of the way .
2007_03_15_1833102	13	So , yes , there will still be Al Qaeda and other extremist elements operating in Baghdad , but we 're not going to be putting pressure on the Iraqi government to limit their response , or to prevent self-defense on the part of people in the neighborhoods who are being subjected to this reign of violence .
2007_03_15_1833102	14	It is going to happen if we stay there a year , if we stay there five years , unless there is some resolution , and I do not yet see that .
2007_03_15_1833102	15	Look , I think the American people are done with Iraq .
2007_03_15_1833102	16	I think they are at a point where , whether they thought it was a good idea or not , they have seen misjudgment , and blunder after blunder , and their attitude is , What is this getting us ?
2007_03_15_1833102	17	What is this doing for us ?
2007_03_15_1833102	18	No one wants to sit by and see mass killing .
2007_03_15_1833102	19	It 's going on every day !
2007_03_15_1833102	20	Thousands of people are dying every month in Iraq .
2007_03_15_1833102	21	Our presence there is not stopping it .
2007_03_15_1833102	22	And there is no potential opportunity that I can imagine where it could .
2007_03_15_1833102	23	This is an Iraqi problem ; we can not save the Iraqis from themselves .
2007_03_15_1833102	24	If we had a different attitude going in there , if we had stopped the looting immediately , if we had asserted our authority -- you can go down the lines , if , if , if -- But we did n't do it .
2007_03_15_1833103	0	Installing Adobe Reader Q. I ca n't seem to download Adobe Acrobat so I can print some rebate forms .
2007_03_15_1833103	1	What can I do ?
2007_03_15_1833103	2	A. Adobe makes several programs that can read Portable Document Format ( PDF ) files , a format used for everything from official tax forms from the I.R.S. to newsletters , rebate forms and magazines .
2007_03_15_1833103	3	Adobe Acrobat and Adobe Reader ( formerly called Adobe Acrobat Reader ) are the two main programs the company offers for working with PDF files , but there are several differences between them to keep in mind .
2007_03_15_1833103	4	Adobe Acrobat , which lets you create , edit and save your own PDF files , comes in several versions aimed at business and graphics professionals .
2007_03_15_1833103	5	The program can cost up to several hundred dollars , depending on which version you get .
2007_03_15_1833103	6	You can purchase the software in stores or by clicking the Store link at www.adobe.com .
2007_03_15_1833103	7	Adobe Reader , on the other hand , is a free program used mostly for displaying and printing PDF files .
2007_03_15_1833103	8	Adobe has versions of the free software for many types of systems , including Windows ( 95 through Vista ) , old and new versions of the Macintosh operating system , Linux , Unix and even hand-held organizers that run the Palm , Pocket PC or Symbian systems .
2007_03_15_1833103	9	You can download Adobe Reader by going to the downloads page on Adobe 's site ( a shortcut is at tinyurl.com/a9sbq ) and following the instructions , which include selecting the appropriate version for your operating system from the pop-up menus on the page .
2007_03_15_1833103	10	Once the file downloads , double-click its icon to start the Adobe Reader installation process .
2007_03_15_1833103	11	PDF files can retain the fonts , images and layout of the document as it was originally designed .
2007_03_15_1833103	12	Adobe created the format , but it is not the only company that makes PDF software .
2007_03_15_1833103	13	Sites like Planet PDF ( www.planetpdf.com ) list other programs for Windows , Macintosh and Linux systems .
2007_03_15_1833103	14	Graphics Programs For the PC Q .
2007_03_15_1833103	15	A few years ago , the general opinion seemed to be that Apple 's Macintosh computer was the one to get if you wanted to do any kind of graphics work .
2007_03_15_1833103	16	I would like to know if this is still the case , or has anybody made progress in the graphics programs for Windows ?
2007_03_15_1833103	17	A. Although Macintosh computers were ( and still are ) the first hardware choice for many graphic designers , illustrators , photographers and artists because of the Macintosh operating system and its selection of software , Windows users have a wide choice of programs , too .
2007_03_15_1833103	18	Corel and Adobe are among the companies making Windows-compatible graphics programs that use common industry file formats , and it 's possible to find plenty of animation , 3-D rendering and architectural software for the PC as well .
2007_03_15_1833103	19	The Google Directory has a list of links to major makers of graphics and photo software at tinyurl.com/346c2t .
2007_03_15_1833103	20	Staying Safe On Windows Vista Q. I just bought a new computer with Windows Vista installed .
2007_03_15_1833103	21	What are my options for security software , or should I just use what came with the system ?
2007_03_15_1833103	22	A. Windows Vista comes with its own firewall and antispyware program , and its Internet Explorer 7 browser includes a pop-up ad blocker and a filter that can help spot fraudulent Web sites and swindles .
2007_03_15_1833103	23	An antivirus program is still essential for safe computing on the Internet , though , and many PC makers include an antivirus application or full security suite as a trial or with a year 's worth of updates .
2007_03_15_1833103	24	If you do n't like the included software , there are other options , as plenty of security companies have upgraded their wares for the Vista system , and some offer limited trial versions to download and try from their Web sites .
2007_03_15_1833103	25	Trend Micro , Symantec and McAfee all have antivirus and security suites that have been updated to run on Windows Vista , and Microsoft has even moved into the market with its own Windows Live OneCare suite .
2007_03_15_1833103	26	If you want more details on software products before you buy and install them , several Web sites have posted reviews of current antivirus and security programs .
2007_03_15_1833103	27	PC Magazine ( www.pcmag.com ) , CNet ( cnet.com ) and PC World ( www.pcworld.com ) frequently rate and review security software , and sites like AV Comparatives ( www.av-comparatives.org ) pit programs against one another to test their effectiveness at stopping malicious software .
2007_03_15_1833103	28	J. D. BIERSDORFER Q & A
2007_03_15_1833104	0	One of the biggest stars of last weekend 's Photo Marketing Association show in Las Vegas was Canon 's new megacam , the $ 4,000 EOS-1D Mark III .
2007_03_15_1833104	1	It does n't capture more pixels than other cameras , just better ones , the company says .
2007_03_15_1833104	2	Canon says its 10-megapixel CMOS sensor ( for complementary metal-oxide semiconductor ) has bigger microlenses over each picture element , so more light from the subject is recorded .
2007_03_15_1833104	3	The camera can shoot at a sensitivity level of ISO 6400 without speckling the images with digital noise .
2007_03_15_1833104	4	The sensitivity allows high-quality photography in very dim light , or the use of a very long lens without a tripod .
2007_03_15_1833104	5	The EOS-1D Mark III is also the first dual-processor camera .
2007_03_15_1833104	6	Two Digic III chips speed up the image processing , the handling of information from 19 autofocus points and the optional saving of uncompressed RAW and compacted JPEG files for each shot .
2007_03_15_1833104	7	With 76 gaskets to keep out the elements and the ability to shoot at 10 frames a second , this is likely to be the tool of choice for photographers on the battlefield or the basketball court .
2007_03_15_1833105	0	Combining the magic of Bluetooth with the wonders of Caller ID , a new wireless headset lets you see who is calling right on the earpiece .
2007_03_15_1833105	1	The BlueAnt V12 Bluetooth headset has a backlit L.C.D. screen that displays the phone number of the caller alongside other information like battery and volume levels .
2007_03_15_1833105	2	The lightweight V12 is available for about $ 60 from retailers and sites listed at www.myblueant.com .
2007_03_15_1833105	3	It stores and shows the last 10 numbers received and can redial a caller with a push of a button .
2007_03_15_1833105	4	Incoming calls cause the headset to vibrate .
2007_03_15_1833105	5	The BlueAnt V12 is also compatible with voice-over-Internet protocol ( VoIP ) service and can be paired with up to five devices .
2007_03_15_1833105	6	The headset uses a lithium polymer battery that can last for up to 12 hours of talk time and up to 15 days on standby between charges .
2007_03_15_1833105	7	And when ear fatigue sets in , the V12 can be snapped on to the included lanyard and worn as a necklace until the next call .
2007_03_15_1833106	0	The Harman Kardon Guide + Play GPS-500 wo n't just get you from Point A to Point B -- it will also entertain you along the way .
2007_03_15_1833106	1	This tiny dashboard-mounted or handheld G.P.S. device has a bright four-inch color touch screen and includes maps for the United States and Canada .
2007_03_15_1833106	2	It can play back MP3 and WMA music files , routing audio to your car radio through a headphone jack .
2007_03_15_1833106	3	When you 're not driving , you can watch MPEG-4 or WMV videos on the device , and a rechargeable battery lets you navigate and listen to music on foot for up to five hours .
2007_03_15_1833106	4	( To avoid overload , the Guide + Play locks the navigation functions when video is playing . )
2007_03_15_1833106	5	The device automatically syncs with Windows Media Player software but requires an SD memory card , sold separately , to play anything other than the few audio tracks and film clips Harman Kardon supplies on the two gigabytes of internal memory .
2007_03_15_1833106	6	It comes with a dashboard mounting kit , cigarette lighter adapter and charger .
2007_03_15_1833106	7	The Guide + Play , which speaks directions in English , French or Spanish , will be available this month for $ 500 .
2007_03_15_1833106	8	A great road-trip playlist is unfortunately not included .
2007_03_15_1833107	0	Web sites like Pandora.com personalize the music you stream to your desk , while satellite radio offers portable listening but little personalized track choice .
2007_03_15_1833107	1	Slacker , a music service unveiled this week , hopes to merge the two concepts into something new : personal portable radio for the computer , car and coat pocket .
2007_03_15_1833107	2	Aimed in name and concept at the music lover who does not want to fritter away hours creating playlists , Slacker offers millions of songs grouped into radio stations by genre or artist .
2007_03_15_1833107	3	Music can be streamed on the Web using the company 's music player at www.slacker.com .

2007_03_15_1833107	5	Slacker has a free version of the service with advertising , as well as an ad-free edition with enhanced personalization for $ 7.50 a month .
2007_03_15_1833107	6	It plans to release hardware offerings later this year .
2007_03_15_1833107	7	Portable devices will download songs over a Wi-Fi connection and store them for later playback , while car stereo units will receive music over a satellite link .
2007_03_15_1833107	8	The standard buck-a-song downloads are on the way as well .
2007_03_15_1833108	0	Just larger than a deck of cards , Franklin 's top-of-the-line Speaking Global Translator can order sushi for you , in 12 languages .
2007_03_15_1833108	1	The $ 230 device , found at www.franklin.com , uses a real human voice instead of a synthesizer to speak typed words in English , Chinese ( Mandarin ) , Dutch , French , German , Italian , Japanese , Korean , Polish , Portuguese , Russian and Spanish .

2007_03_15_1833108	6	While the interface has improved over earlier Franklin translators , the buttons are tiny , and reading glasses may be in order .
2007_03_15_1833108	7	The battery is charged through a computer 's U.S.B. port , providing up to a week of translations .
2007_03_15_1833110	0	'' We would not be doing patrols .
2007_03_15_1833110	1	We would not be kicking in doors .
2007_03_15_1833110	2	We would not be trying to insert ourselves in the middle between the various Shiite and Sunni factions .
2007_03_15_1833110	3	I do not think that 's a smart or achievable mission for American forces . ''
2007_03_15_1833110	4	HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON , on her Iraq policy if elected president .
2007_03_15_1833111	0	'' A small bank is the vein that carries blood to the heart , '' said Edward Carpenter , chairman of Carpenter & Company , an investment bank that in 33 years has organized the founding of 708 banks in California and across the United States .
2007_03_15_1833111	1	Mr. Carpenter , 58 , is passionate about the need for community banks , by which he means locally owned banks created with $ 16 million to $ 30 million in capital from investors and operating with a state or federal charter .
2007_03_15_1833111	2	Carpenter & Company , based in Irvine , Calif. , organizes an average of 15 banks a year by recruiting investors and executives , raising money and guiding the proposed bank through the regulatory process .
2007_03_15_1833111	3	Community banks keep financing flowing to local entrepreneurs and family companies , Mr. Carpenter said , at a time when mergers have reduced the number of banks in the nation to 7,402 at the end of last year from 14,411 banks in 1977 .
2007_03_15_1833111	4	The consolidation , in his eyes , has given rise to the need for the more personal touch found in local banks .
2007_03_15_1833111	5	Mr. Carpenter 's ideal is a bank founded by some 25 to 50 organizers who put up risk capital .
2007_03_15_1833111	6	A typical bank , he said , will have 12 directors , including top executives and other pillars of the community , and managers who have experience in banking . ''
2007_03_15_1833111	7	They raise $ 20 million to start the bank and plan on having $ 200 million in deposits and $ 150 million in loans in the third year .
2007_03_15_1833111	8	With an average loan of $ 1 million , all they have to do is generate 150 loans in three years , '' said Mr. Carpenter , who has a master 's degree in business administration from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania .
2007_03_15_1833111	9	Business is brisk these days at Carpenter & Company because the number of banks being formed in California is greater than the number being absorbed by other banks in mergers , according to the California Bankers Association in a joint study with Carpenter & Company .
2007_03_15_1833111	10	Entrepreneurs and investors are attracted to banking for several reasons , among them the fact that companies are being created in all industries .
2007_03_15_1833111	11	The United States has 26 million independent businesses , according to the Census Bureau , up from 21 million in 1990 .
2007_03_15_1833111	12	Banks of every category , from national giants to regional powerhouses to local community banks , are devoted to serving the needs of small to medium-size companies : those with 100 or fewer employees and annual revenue ranging from a few million to $ 50 million .
2007_03_15_1833111	13	Banks formed with Carpenter & Company 's assistance illustrate aspects of the entrepreneurial trend .
2007_03_15_1833111	14	Coronado First Bank , for example , is focused on its local market .
2007_03_15_1833111	15	Coronado is an island city of 15,000 people in San Diego Bay that is renowned for its naval base and resort hotels .
2007_03_15_1833111	16	The bank opened in 2005 , thanks to the efforts of Thomas C. Stickel , a businessman and former trustee of the California State University system .
2007_03_15_1833111	17	Mr. Stickel , who lives in Coronado , said he was disturbed when the city 's local bank was acquired by San Diego investors in 2002 and merged into a larger banking company . ''
2007_03_15_1833111	18	So I attracted a good group of organizers and directors , including our local hero , retired Vice Adm. Edward H. Martin , and Gerald R. Sanders , who is now mayor of San Diego , '' Mr. Stickel said .
2007_03_15_1833111	19	Admiral Martin , a prisoner of war in Vietnam , was a cellmate in Hanoi of Senator John McCain of Arizona .
2007_03_15_1833111	20	Mr. Stickel attracted $ 13 million in capital and a chief executive , Bruce A. Ives , who said he saw Coronado First Bank as capable of growing to $ 250 million in assets serving local businesses and residents .
2007_03_15_1833111	21	How can a small community bank realistically compete with branches of larger institutions ? ''
2007_03_15_1833111	22	Technology , '' Mr. Stickel said .
2007_03_15_1833111	23	These days with computerized services that banks can buy from outside vendors and Internet banking , '' our technology is competitive with anybody 's . ''
2007_03_15_1833111	24	More ambitious is 1st Enterprise Bank in Los Angeles and Orange County , founded last year by K. Brian Horton , president , and John C. Black , chief executive , who were recruited by Mr. Carpenter .
2007_03_15_1833111	25	Both had worked for 1st Business Bank , a bank for entrepreneurs that had grown to $ 3 billion in assets and was acquired in 1998 by the Mellon Financial Corporation .
2007_03_15_1833111	26	Mr. Horton and Mr. Black worked at Mellon until 2005 , when they went out on their own and with Mr. Carpenter 's help raised $ 27.5 million to open 1st Enterprise Bank last July . ''
2007_03_15_1833111	27	We 'll take this to a $ 1 billion assets bank by catering to clients in Los Angeles and Orange Counties , '' Mr. Horton said .
2007_03_15_1833111	28	Ethnic group banking is a growth industry . ''
2007_03_15_1833111	29	There are 12 Hispanic-led banks being organized in the United States , 7 of them in California , '' Mr. Carpenter said .
2007_03_15_1833111	30	They include Banco Tepeyac , which is being organized by a former Citibank official , Emilio Sanchez-Santiago , and 80 investors from Mexico and the United States who are putting up $ 18 million .
2007_03_15_1833111	31	Pending approval of a state charter , Tepeyac will open its doors as a retail bank in Huntington Park , a heavily Latino city of 62,000 in Los Angeles County .
2007_03_15_1833111	32	Its name in the Nahuatl language , derives from the hill of Tepeyac outside Mexico City , the site of the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe .
2007_03_15_1833111	33	Another example is an effort by Kevin Rosenberg , managing partner of an executive search firm , to start a bank .
2007_03_15_1833111	34	Mr. Rosenberg wanted to expand office space for his 40-year-old company , BridgeGate , and asked his bank for a loan .
2007_03_15_1833111	35	He was turned down , and so he is starting a formal effort to raise capital for a bank he has named Access Business Bank .
2007_03_15_1833111	36	With all the small banks starting , it would be easy to overlook that the largest lender to small business is Bank of America , with 4.9 million small-company clients .
2007_03_15_1833111	37	Bank of America , with $ 1.46 trillion in assets and the nation 's second-largest banking company , behind Citigroup , has a small-business division devoted to serving companies with $ 2.5 million or less in annual revenue .
2007_03_15_1833111	38	It made 13,000 Small Business Administration loans last year through its 5,800 branches nationwide . ''
2007_03_15_1833111	39	We make loans of $ 100,000 and less every day , '' said Mark Hogan , president of the bank 's small-business banking unit . ''
2007_03_15_1833111	40	And we provide online management for payroll and invoicing services for small companies on a 24-hour , seven-day basis . ''
2007_03_15_1833111	41	Christopher D. Myers , chief executive of CVB Financial , which owns Citizens Business Bank of Ontario , Calif. , agrees that large banks offer international and sophisticated cash management services that are beyond the abilities of most small banks .
2007_03_15_1833111	42	But even in local markets , size matters , Mr. Myers said .
2007_03_15_1833111	43	Over 34 years , he has taken Citizens Business Bank from a single office to 33 cities in Southern and Central California and $ 6 billion in assets .
2007_03_15_1833111	44	Last month , the bank agreed to a $ 35 million deal with First Coastal Bank of Manhattan Beach , extending Citizens reach to the coastal cities . ''
2007_03_15_1833111	45	Now we are local bankers in 42 locations , '' Mr. Myers said .
2007_03_15_1833111	46	He sees competition heating up for community banks . ''
2007_03_15_1833111	47	Founders may have to wait longer for their good returns , '' he said .
2007_03_15_1833111	48	One attraction of community banks is that founders can make a good return on their money over five to seven years .
2007_03_15_1833111	49	In fact , that is what Mr. Carpenter intended .
2007_03_15_1833111	50	He worked in the early 1970s for Security Pacific , a Los Angeles bank that acquired others .
2007_03_15_1833111	51	( Security Pacific was itself acquired by Bank of America in 1992 ) .
2007_03_15_1833111	52	Mr. Carpenter saw takeovers and layoffs and did not like it . ''
2007_03_15_1833111	53	This dislocation of corporate America really bugged me , '' he recalled in an interview . ''
2007_03_15_1833111	54	I saw my friends losing jobs and I thought I can help them found their own banks and hire other friends as senior officers and never treat their people the way they were treated . ''

2007_03_15_1833112	0	The Department of Defense has identified 3,187 American service members who have died since the start of the Iraq war .
2007_03_15_1833112	1	It confirmed the deaths of the following Americans this week : WINDSOR , Nathanial D. , 20 , Lance Cpl. , Marines ; Scappoose , Ore. ; First Marine Division .
2007_03_15_1833112	2	LATHAM , Thomas L. , 23 , Sgt. , Army ; Delmar , Md. ; 10th Mountain Division .
2007_03_15_1833113	0	An extensive study of heart attack patients in New Jersey finds that those who arrived at hospitals on weekends were less likely to receive aggressive treatment and were slightly more likely to die than those who arrived on weekdays , researchers are reporting today .
2007_03_15_1833113	1	The study , based on an analysis of 231,164 heart attack patients admitted to New Jersey hospitals from 1987 to 2002 , found a gap of almost 1 percentage point in heart attack death rates over one three-year span , 12.9 percent for weekend patients and 12 percent for weekday patients .
2007_03_15_1833113	2	The deaths occurred within a month of admission .
2007_03_15_1833113	3	In that period , 1999 to 2002 , 10 percent of weekday patients had angioplasty to open blocked arteries on the day they were admitted , compared with 6.7 percent of weekend patients .
2007_03_15_1833113	4	Angioplasty within a few hours of the start of heart attacks can interrupt the attacks and save lives .
2007_03_15_1833113	5	The study , led by William J. Kostis , a fourth-year medical student at the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in New Brunswick , N.J. , who also has a Ph.D. in electrical engineering , is being published today in The New England Journal of Medicine .
2007_03_15_1833113	6	Dr. Donald A. Redelmeier , a professor of medicine at the University of Toronto who wrote an accompanying editorial , said the higher death rate on weekends '' has everything to do with staffing in hospitals . ''
2007_03_15_1833113	7	It can mean , Dr. Redelmeier said , that not enough expert medical staff members are available on weekends for prompt and aggressive treatment . ''
2007_03_15_1833113	8	It 's not just that there are fewer people around , but those who are around are often spread thinner , '' he added . ''
2007_03_15_1833113	9	And there is a shift in seniority , as well .
2007_03_15_1833113	10	The most skilled and savvy people do n't work weekends . ''
2007_03_15_1833113	11	Dr. Kostis said the correlation between more deaths and less angioplasty on weekends was significant . ''
2007_03_15_1833113	12	One out of every 100 who died , '' he said , '' died potentially unnecessarily . ''
2007_03_15_1833113	13	He and others emphasize , however , that people having heart attacks remain much better off going to hospitals on a weekend than waiting until Monday morning .
2007_03_15_1833113	14	Although some investigators said the findings gave them pause , not everyone was convinced that there was a cause-and-effect relationship between lower angioplasty rates and higher death rates .
2007_03_15_1833113	15	Dr. Eric D. Peterson , a cardiologist at Duke University who led a similar study with a national sample of patients , found that although there was less angioplasty on weekends , there was no difference in mortality rates . ''
2007_03_15_1833113	16	We could n't prove that early catheterization was that key , '' Dr. Peterson said , using a term for same-day angioplasty .
2007_03_15_1833113	17	He added that the results might reflect findings from New Jersey at a time angioplasty for heart attack patients was being adopted .
2007_03_15_1833113	18	Dr. Mark A. Hlatky , a cardiologist and professor of health research and policy at Stanford University , doubted that the sole reason for extra weekend deaths was less aggressive care . ''
2007_03_15_1833113	19	There is more going on , '' Dr. Hlatky said .
2007_03_15_1833113	20	The weekend effect shows up in the data as early as 1987 to 1990 , when angioplasty was almost never used to save the lives of heart attack patients . ''
2007_03_15_1833113	21	So this is not as simple as ` no doctor to do the procedure on weekends , ' '' Dr. Hlatky said , adding that other factors might include staffing in coronary intensive care units .
2007_03_15_1833113	22	Dr. Hlatky noted that not just hospitals were different on weekends .
2007_03_15_1833113	23	Patients are different , too .
2007_03_15_1833113	24	Other studies have found that weekend heart attack patients are sicker and waited longer before going to hospitals .
2007_03_15_1833113	25	The time is limited , a few hours at most , from the beginning of a heart attack to when it is too late for angioplasty to save a life .
2007_03_15_1833113	26	The new study did not include data on the severity of the heart attacks , how sick patients were or how long they waited before going to hospitals .
2007_03_15_1833113	27	Dr. Hlatky said there were indications that weekend and weekday patients in the study were different . ''
2007_03_15_1833113	28	More patients per day were admitted on the weekends compared with weekdays , '' Dr. Hlatky said . ''
2007_03_15_1833113	29	And they were significantly different in age , sex and rate of complications .
2007_03_15_1833113	30	There clearly is a difference in the patients admitted to the hospital on the weekend with a heart attack . ''
2007_03_15_1833113	31	I agree that we need to be ready 24/7 to take care of serious problems like heart attacks .
2007_03_15_1833113	32	But I do n't think it 's the entire answer , and to say we can fix it with angiography is an oversimplification . ''
2007_03_15_1833113	33	Dr. Thomas H. Lee , a cardiologist and the network president for Partners Healthcare , a medical care system that includes two Harvard teaching hospitals , said the study indicated that hospitals could do better , making sure that weekend patients received the same level of care as weekday patients . ''
2007_03_15_1833113	34	We are pretty aggressive in this country , '' Dr. Lee said . ''
2007_03_15_1833113	35	Our hospital and other places have worked to make sure these services are available around the clock .
2007_03_15_1833113	36	But human beings are human beings , and these data really suggest that hospitals may have too high a threshold for calling in their colleagues . ''
2007_03_15_1833114	0	Torii Hunter thinks about a former teammate whenever he tucks his 11-year-old son , Torii Jr. , into bed . ''
2007_03_15_1833114	1	He has a shirt he sleeps in every night , a Doug Mientkiewicz shirt , '' said Hunter , the Minnesota Twins ' center fielder . ''
2007_03_15_1833114	2	It 's an old Twins shirt with holes in it .
2007_03_15_1833114	3	He 's probably getting too big for it now , but Doug is his favorite .
2007_03_15_1833114	4	He played with him all the time . ''
2007_03_15_1833114	5	Mientkiewicz now plays for the Yankees , his fourth team since leaving the Twins for the Boston Red Sox in a 2004 trade .
2007_03_15_1833114	6	But the Twins , who lost to the Yankees by 4-1 at Legends Field on Wednesday , are never far from his mind .
2007_03_15_1833114	7	Fans may know Mientkiewicz for catching the last out of the World Series with the Red Sox .
2007_03_15_1833114	8	Historians know him as the only player ever to win a Gold Glove and an Olympic gold medal .
2007_03_15_1833114	9	But to Mientkiewicz , nothing has mattered as much as his role in turning around the Twins . ''
2007_03_15_1833114	10	That is by far the thing I 'm most proud of , the fact that we , as a group , took a franchise that if you finish .500 , they were going to give you a parade , and now it 's like , if they do n't win a series in the playoffs , it 's a failure , '' he said . ''
2007_03_15_1833114	11	Before we got there , it was a dismal place to play , because they were n't winning .
2007_03_15_1833114	12	We always felt that we were going to win , and we were going to win soon . ''
2007_03_15_1833114	13	Before the 2002 season , when the Twins ' franchise was threatened with contraction , Mientkiewicz and Hunter called each other and resolved to win immediately .
2007_03_15_1833114	14	They went on to reach the American League Championship Series two years after finishing last .
2007_03_15_1833114	15	That team has mostly splintered away , although shrewd management has kept the Twins in contention every year .
2007_03_15_1833114	16	The Twins who Mientkiewicz grew up with -- Hunter , Jacque Jones , A. J. Pierzynski and others -- remain his closest friends in baseball . ''
2007_03_15_1833114	17	I saw him in a movie the other day , ` The Departed , ' '' Hunter said . ''
2007_03_15_1833114	18	There was a picture in the background of Doug Mientkiewicz jumping up and down .
2007_03_15_1833114	19	I was like , ` That 's Doug ! '
2007_03_15_1833114	20	I texted him : ` You 're a star . '
2007_03_15_1833114	21	We kept rewinding it just to see . ''
2007_03_15_1833114	22	The Red Sox ' moment of triumph brought controversy to Mientkiewicz , who kept the ball from the last out .
2007_03_15_1833114	23	That started a public tug of war with the team for custody of the ball , which now resides at the Hall of Fame .
2007_03_15_1833114	24	Mientkiewicz understands he may always be known for his role in Boston , where he played for only three months . ''
2007_03_15_1833114	25	That 's fine , '' he said . ''
2007_03_15_1833114	26	As long as it 's not for the World Series ball . ''
2007_03_15_1833114	27	Though some fans boo him in Boston , Mientkiewicz said most fans were gracious and appreciated his small contribution .
2007_03_15_1833114	28	He is not sure how to react . ''
2007_03_15_1833114	29	They always say , ` Thank you for winning , ' '' Mientkiewicz said . ''
2007_03_15_1833114	30	Well , what do you say to that ?
2007_03_15_1833114	31	That 's our job .
2007_03_15_1833114	32	We 're supposed to win .
2007_03_15_1833114	33	I 'm sure I 'll get booed there this year , but at least I have a reason to be booed now that I 've got the pinstripes on , which is fine . ''
2007_03_15_1833114	34	Mientkiewicz , who played for the Mets in 2005 and the Royals last season , watched the Yankees in the playoffs last October .
2007_03_15_1833114	35	Gary Sheffield was playing awkwardly at first base and was unlikely to return .
2007_03_15_1833114	36	Mientkiewicz said he believed he could help , and the Yankees signed him in January .
2007_03_15_1833114	37	The original plan was for Mientkiewicz to platoon at first base with Andy Phillips or Josh Phelps .
2007_03_15_1833114	38	But Mientkiewicz , a left-handed hitter , hits lefties about as well as righties , and Manager Joe Torre wants to use him every day . ''
2007_03_15_1833114	39	Right now , we have no plans for a straight platoon , '' Torre said . ''
2007_03_15_1833114	40	Defensively , he 's our best option , and if you expect to have pitching as a strong suit , defense is going to be very important . ''
2007_03_15_1833114	41	Mientkiewicz started this spring 0 for 11 , and he has only one hit in 19 at-bats .
2007_03_15_1833114	42	Early in camp , he said , '' I did n't feel like I was ever going to get a hit . ''
2007_03_15_1833114	43	He said he felt better now , but overanalysis has hurt him before . ''
2007_03_15_1833114	44	He sometimes becomes his own worst enemy , '' Twins Manager Ron Gardenhire said . ''
2007_03_15_1833114	45	He 'll talk to a bag of balls about hitting .
2007_03_15_1833114	46	When Doug just goes out there and relaxes , he 's pretty good . ''
2007_03_15_1833114	47	Mientkiewicz , a good contact hitter and bunter , said he worked three times harder on his hitting than his fielding .
2007_03_15_1833114	48	Last season , his average improved every month , and he was up to .283 before back surgery ended his season in August .
2007_03_15_1833114	49	But his greatest asset will always be his glove .
2007_03_15_1833114	50	He wears a Rawlings model inscribed with the word '' MOM '' on the side as a tribute to his mother , Janice , who battled breast cancer last season .
2007_03_15_1833114	51	She is cancer-free now , but Mientkiewicz 's tribute remains . ''
2007_03_15_1833114	52	Always , '' he said . ''
2007_03_15_1833114	53	Why not just leave it there ?
2007_03_15_1833114	54	INSIDE PITCH Jeff Karstens continued his strong bid to make the roster with four scoreless innings on Wednesday .
2007_03_15_1833114	55	Karstens , who added 15 pounds over the winter and is throwing much harder , has allowed five hits and no walks over nine scoreless innings this spring .
2007_03_15_1833114	56	The Yankees reassigned their top prospect , Phil Hughes , to minor league camp Wednesday .
2007_03_15_1833114	57	Hughes had a 7.71 earned run average in three games , and he said he would try to refine his changeup at Class AAA Scranton . ''
2007_03_15_1833114	58	You ca n't come in here and expect to get big league hitters out with just two pitches , '' Hughes said .
2007_03_15_1833115	0	The recent volatility and pullback in Asian markets have prompted some investors to sound a familiar refrain : It 's all the fault of the hedge funds .
2007_03_15_1833115	1	In the last two years , dozens of these funds have set up shop in Asia hoping to find relatively hidden lucrative opportunities , as markets in Europe and the United States become more crowded and competitive .
2007_03_15_1833115	2	Their trading in equity markets has grown sharply : they were responsible for 22 percent of the brokerage commissions paid on Asian cash equity trades in 2006 , up from 5 percent in 2004 , according to Greenwich Associates .
2007_03_15_1833115	3	Many small traders and brokers in the region argue that the growing influence of hedge funds in Asia has exaggerated market movements , particularly the declines that rocked global markets recently .
2007_03_15_1833115	4	They also say the funds contribute to higher volatility in the Asian equity markets .
2007_03_15_1833115	5	Hedge funds are going to create even more unpredictable gyrations in the future , making things still more difficult for other investors , they say .
2007_03_15_1833115	6	Yesterday , markets across Asia fell again on worries about the Western markets and the outlook for the American economy , with the Nikkei average in Tokyo falling 2.92 percent .
2007_03_15_1833115	7	Regulators are keeping a close eye on these funds .
2007_03_15_1833115	8	Market regulators from Britain and Hong Kong are meeting Indian regulators in Mumbai in April to discuss hedge fund participation in markets .
2007_03_15_1833115	9	It is the first time India has been host of such a roundtable .
2007_03_15_1833115	10	A fifteenfold increase in market capitalization on Vietnam 's stock market recently ignited fears among regional market analysts that Vietnamese regulators would impose capital controls to start shutting out foreign investors .
2007_03_15_1833115	11	Aggressive hedge fund managers normally take positions intended to profit from a market decline if they anticipate one .
2007_03_15_1833115	12	Many say that the correction in late February was widely expected .
2007_03_15_1833115	13	In December , fund managers in Asia say they had begun warning of an imminent slide in markets .
2007_03_15_1833115	14	What is surprising about the February drop , though , analysts said , was how few hedge fund managers appeared to have actually profited from the market declines .
2007_03_15_1833115	15	Instead , they seemed to have been trying to take advantage of the bull market for Asian stocks and bonds by buying aggressively .
2007_03_15_1833115	16	Short selling , bets that certain stocks will fall , is not allowed in some Asian equity markets .
2007_03_15_1833115	17	But fund managers can mimic that strategy by using complicated financial derivatives and options to achieve the same effect .
2007_03_15_1833115	18	When stocks started to move down , though , investors jumped out , making drops even steeper .
2007_03_15_1833115	19	Referring to the sell-off that began in late February , Henry To , investment adviser at MarketThoughts , said , '' At the height of the selling , money managers in Asia were remarking that they have not experienced this kind of selling intensity since the height of the Asia Crisis '' in 1997 and 1998 .
2007_03_15_1833115	20	A focus on hedge funds does not tell the whole story , though , emerging market veterans say . ''
2007_03_15_1833115	21	The ferocity to which the market decline in China spilled over to the global markets is to some extent attributable to hedge funds , '' said Marc Faber , an investment adviser , nicknamed Dr. Doom for his bearish sentiments . ''
2007_03_15_1833115	22	But today , it is not just the hedge funds that act like hedge funds -- it is also the proprietary desks of banks like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley . ''
2007_03_15_1833115	23	Because the compensation of traders at these banks is based on short - term trading profits , '' when the market goes down they all sell , '' Mr. Faber said .
2007_03_15_1833115	24	Wall Street investment banks have poured money and talent into proprietary trading desks in recent years , helping to earn record profits for their banks .
2007_03_15_1833115	25	Assets under management at these proprietary desks are difficult to quantify , but analysts at Keefe Bruyette & Woods estimate that these banks have more than doubled the amount of money in those businesses since 2001 .
2007_03_15_1833115	26	Other factors are also influencing the Asian equity markets .
2007_03_15_1833115	27	Hedge funds are '' a growing player , and arguably a shorter-term player , '' said Hugh Young , managing director at Aberdeen Asset Management Asia . ''
2007_03_15_1833115	28	But there is a lot of human emotion involved across the board , '' from both hedge funds , traditional funds and other investors .
2007_03_15_1833115	29	A wide array of established hedge funds and the firms that service them are setting up shop or expanding operations in Asia , including K2 Advisors and Bisys Alternative Investment Services .
2007_03_15_1833115	30	In some thinly traded Asian markets , the influx of new capital can be felt keenly .
2007_03_15_1833115	31	Trading volume of Asian interest rate derivatives tripled , to $ 414 billion , in 2006 from the year before , Greenwich said , and the amount of credit derivatives doubled to $ 67 billion .
2007_03_15_1833115	32	Greenwich Associates estimates that hedge funds account for 30 percent of the total trading in one of these assets , structured credit derivatives .
2007_03_15_1833115	33	What is difficult is quantifying how each market participant adds to Asian volatility . ''
2007_03_15_1833115	34	Liquidity is an ephemeral concept at best , '' said Edmund Harriss , investment director at Guinness Atkinson Asset Managers and manager of three Asia-focused funds .
2007_03_15_1833115	35	For example , estimates for the carry trade , where investors borrow yen at low interest rates and convert into other currencies to make investments in higher yielding markets , '' range from $ 100 billion to $ 600 billion , and we have no idea and ca n't measure it , '' Mr. Harriss said .
2007_03_15_1833115	36	Rather than blaming hedge funds , '' we should take a step back and look at what is going on in equity markets generally : we should expect volatility in equity markets , period , and that is because we are not sure which way the economy is going to go , '' Mr. Harriss said .
2007_03_15_1833115	37	Heavy-handed efforts to control foreign investment have proved disastrous for Asian regulators .
2007_03_15_1833115	38	Citing a flow of $ 1 billion into its bond market in a single week , Thailand 's central bank imposed capital controls in December , a move that investors punished by sending the country 's stock market down 7 percent in a single day .
2007_03_15_1833115	39	Thailand has since relaxed those controls .
2007_03_15_1833115	40	Policy makers in South Korea and the Philippines have relaxed restrictions on capital outflows to slow the appreciation of their currencies .
2007_03_15_1833116	0	Following are excerpts from the testimony of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed on March 10 in a Combatant Status Review Tribunal hearing provided by the United States government .
2007_03_15_1833116	1	Parts were edited out .
2007_03_15_1833116	2	Mr. Mohammed 's statements , parts in English and parts in Arabic through a translator , came in response to instructions that he could say '' whatever you 'd like to say so long as it 's relevant '' : Many Muslims , that Al Qaeda or Taliban they are doing .
2007_03_15_1833116	3	They have been oppressed by America .
2007_03_15_1833116	4	This is the feeling of the prophet .
2007_03_15_1833116	5	So when we say we are enemy combatant , that right .
2007_03_15_1833116	6	But I am asking you again to be fair with many detainees which are not enemy combatant .
2007_03_15_1833116	7	Because many of them have been unjustly arrested .
2007_03_15_1833116	8	Many , not one or two or three .
2007_03_15_1833116	9	Cause the definition you which wrote even from my view it is not fair .
2007_03_15_1833116	10	Because war , for sure , there will be victims .
2007_03_15_1833116	11	When I said I 'm not happy that 3,000 been killed in America .
2007_03_15_1833116	12	I feel sorry even .
2007_03_15_1833116	13	I do n't like to kill children and the kids .
2007_03_15_1833116	14	Never Islam are , give me green light to kill peoples .
2007_03_15_1833116	15	Killing , as in the Christianity , Jews , and Islam , are prohibited .
2007_03_15_1833116	16	But there are exception of rule when you are killing people in Iraq .
2007_03_15_1833116	17	You said we have to do it .
2007_03_15_1833116	18	We do n't like Saddam .
2007_03_15_1833116	19	But this the way to deal with Saddam .
2007_03_15_1833116	20	Same thing you are saying .
2007_03_15_1833116	21	Same language you use , I use .
2007_03_15_1833116	22	When you are invading two-thirds of Mexican , you call your war manifest destiny .
2007_03_15_1833116	23	It up to you to call it what you want .
2007_03_15_1833116	24	But other side are calling you oppressors .
2007_03_15_1833116	25	If now George Washington .
2007_03_15_1833116	26	If now we were living in the Revolutionary War and George Washington he being arrested through Britain .
2007_03_15_1833116	27	For sure he , they would consider him enemy combatant .
2007_03_15_1833116	28	But American they consider him as hero .
2007_03_15_1833117	0	The word from many sleep experts yesterday was that , despite the federal warning , prescription sleeping pills are relatively safe drugs if taken as directed .
2007_03_15_1833117	1	But that is a big if . ''
2007_03_15_1833117	2	Any medication has potential side effects , '' said Dr. Daniel Buysse , a professor of psychiatry at University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and a specialist in sleep disorders . ''
2007_03_15_1833117	3	Patients have to realize that medications may have adverse effects , but their own behavior -- in terms of how they take the medication -- may heighten or minimize those risks as well , '' Dr. Buysse said . ''
2007_03_15_1833117	4	That 's a very important message . ''
2007_03_15_1833117	5	He and other sleep experts emphasized that patients should take only the prescribed dose at the prescribed time , not increase the dose , not combine sleeping pills with other sedative drugs and not take them with alcohol .
2007_03_15_1833117	6	And sleeping pills , they said , should not be combined with nonprescription medications like Tylenol PM or Benadryl , an over-the-counter antihistamine whose side effect is drowsiness .
2007_03_15_1833117	7	Some consumers , though , resolved yesterday to avoid prescription sleeping pills altogether , after the Food and Drug Administration issued its warning .
2007_03_15_1833117	8	One of them was Amy Masciola , a 38-year-old labor organizer who lives in Silver Spring , Md. .
2007_03_15_1833117	9	Ms. Masciola said she has had trouble sleeping ever since she was a graduate student struggling to write a dissertation on 18th-century crime .
2007_03_15_1833117	10	Over the years she has tried sleeping pills like Ambien , and seen a therapist to deal with her anxiety .
2007_03_15_1833117	11	But she still wakes up occasionally in the middle of the night , unable to fall back asleep .
2007_03_15_1833117	12	From now on , she said , if she is desperate for sleep she plans to fall back on an old trick she learned from a friend : take Benadryl . ''
2007_03_15_1833117	13	That seems a fairly harmless thing to take , '' Ms. Masciola said .
2007_03_15_1833117	14	But doctors say that because all drugs have their own side effect , patients are better off taking medications for the specific condition they are designed to treat .
2007_03_15_1833117	15	One key to using prescription sleep medications , experts said , is to take them only at home and prepared for bedtime .
2007_03_15_1833117	16	Many patients , worried that it will take time for the drug to kick in , fail to follow this fundamental directive . ''
2007_03_15_1833117	17	They know they 're going to be getting home late at night and they 're concerned about not being able to get to sleep right away , so they take it before getting home , '' said Dr. Michael J. Thorpy , director of the Sleep-Wake Disorders Center at Montefiore Medical Center . ''
2007_03_15_1833117	18	That 's totally inappropriate , and they should n't be doing that . ''
2007_03_15_1833117	19	He said patients also need to make sure they will have time for a full night 's sleep after taking the medicine .
2007_03_15_1833117	20	For people who take sleeping pills , or are considering them , here are questions to ask the doctor : First , ask for precise instructions about how much medicine to take and when to take it .
2007_03_15_1833117	21	Ask the doctor to explain fully the adverse effects , and then be sure to read the medication guide that comes with the drug .
2007_03_15_1833117	22	Tell the doctor about all other prescription and nonprescription drugs already being taken , and ask whether they are safe to use with sleeping pills .
2007_03_15_1833117	23	Because some people metabolize drugs more slowly than others , it is important for people particularly sensitive to medications to tell the doctor .
2007_03_15_1833117	24	Ask the doctor how to plan for situations where alcohol will be consumed , or when a work or travel schedule will not allow a full eight hours of sleep .
2007_03_15_1833117	25	If your sleep disturbances persist , ask the doctor whether an underlying illness or mental health problem might be a factor .
2007_03_15_1833117	26	Whenever starting a new medication , pay attention to any unusual effects and report them to the doctor promptly .
2007_03_15_1833117	27	They may be related to the new drug .
2007_03_15_1833118	0	WARNING FOR SLEEPING PILLS -- The most widely prescribed sleeping pills , including Ambien and Lunesta , can cause strange behavior like driving and eating while asleep , the Food and Drug Administration said , announcing that strong new warnings would be placed on the labels of 13 drugs .

2007_03_15_1833120	0	Olateju Ogunremi has won two lotteries : the visa lottery that enabled him to emigrate from Nigeria in 1999 and the housing lottery that is allowing him , his wife and their three children to move into a new two-family house in East New York , Brooklyn .
2007_03_15_1833120	1	Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg presented Mr. Ogunremi yesterday morning with a key to the house , at 235 Van Siclen Avenue , as the mayor announced what he called a milestone in his 10-year , $ 7.5 billion plan to build or preserve 165,000 units of low - to moderate-cost housing .
2007_03_15_1833120	2	As of this week , officials said , 55,000 units , one-third of the goal , have been financed .
2007_03_15_1833120	3	However , that achievement is tempered by several setbacks .
2007_03_15_1833120	4	An increasing number of rental units have been removed from programs like Mitchell-Lama that hold down rents for low - and moderate-income residents .
2007_03_15_1833120	5	Rising home prices and rents are driving out some tenants and homeowners and transforming once-gritty neighborhoods .
2007_03_15_1833120	6	As a result , the 10-year plan , called the New Housing Marketplace , may end up mainly replenishing a depleted stock of working - and middle-class homes , instead of producing a net increase .
2007_03_15_1833120	7	Even so , the Housing Vacancy Survey , conducted by the Census Bureau in 2005 , reported a 33 percent homeownership rate in New York City , the highest ever reported .
2007_03_15_1833120	8	Mr. Ogunremi , 42 , was delighted to be joining the ranks of homeowners . ''
2007_03_15_1833120	9	This is a great opportunity for me and my family , '' he told the mayor .
2007_03_15_1833120	10	Mr. Ogunremi 's family was one of nine selected from about 3,000 applicants for the chance to buy nine two-family houses developed on what had been vacant city-owned land , on Van Siclen Avenue and around the corner on Glenmore Avenue .
2007_03_15_1833120	11	To be eligible for the lottery , a family had to have an annual household income of less than $ 70,000 .
2007_03_15_1833120	12	Mr. Ogunremi paid $ 330,000 for the semidetached house , which includes a rental unit that will yield income to defray his mortgage payments .
2007_03_15_1833120	13	As a resident of East New York and as a city employee -- he works for the Department of Homeless Services -- Mr. Ogunremi received preferences in the lottery .
2007_03_15_1833120	14	Still , the odds were daunting .
2007_03_15_1833120	15	The nine houses , with faces of cedar and aluminum , look as though they belong in the Pacific Northwest rather than eastern Brooklyn .
2007_03_15_1833120	16	They were developed by a team including E T Partners , which oversaw construction and marketing ; Della Valle Bernheimer , an architectural firm , which collaborated on the design with three other architectural practices ; and CPC Resources , a subsidiary of the Community Preservation Corporation , which arranged for more than $ 2.5 million in financing .
2007_03_15_1833120	17	The project emerged from the New Foundations program of the city 's Department of Housing Preservation and Development .
2007_03_15_1833120	18	Under the program , developers buy city-owned land and are responsible for design , construction and marketing .
2007_03_15_1833120	19	The developers are eligible for some subsidies and are permitted to make a profit .
2007_03_15_1833120	20	The Housing Partnership Development Corporation , which collaborates with the city , took ownership of the nine buildings and provided technical help .
2007_03_15_1833120	21	Shaun Donovan , the city 's commissioner of housing preservation and development , acknowledged the daunting challenges of trying to build low - and moderate-income homes , as space is dwindling in the city .
2007_03_15_1833120	22	In August 2005 , Mr. Donovan and Mr. Bloomberg had visited East New York to announce that the last vacant lots in a once-large portfolio of tax-foreclosed properties were being transferred to nonprofit groups or developers to build housing . ''
2007_03_15_1833120	23	We are moving from a problem of abandonment to a problem of affordability , '' Mr. Donovan said .
2007_03_15_1833120	24	Philip Tugendrajch , of E T Partners , was more blunt . ''
2007_03_15_1833120	25	This area was scary , '' he said . ''
2007_03_15_1833120	26	You could n't come here .
2007_03_15_1833120	27	Now it 's really wonderful seeing these people from all over the world moving in . ''
2007_03_15_1833120	28	The mayor 's housing plan formally began in July 2003 as a 65,000-unit plan and was expanded in February 2006 to 165,000 units .
2007_03_15_1833120	29	Of the 55,000 units that have been financed , 41,366 have been completed , officials said .
2007_03_15_1833121	0	Now the budget fight is getting personal .
2007_03_15_1833121	1	The testy relationship between Gov. Eliot Spitzer and Joseph L. Bruno , the State Senate majority leader , veered into nastiness during an argument in the governor 's office on Wednesday , just minutes after the two had appeared together at a solemn bill-signing ceremony . ''
2007_03_15_1833121	2	It was a spirited discussion between two guys who are n't effete , '' said Darren Dopp , the governor 's communications director . ''
2007_03_15_1833121	3	It only broke down after Majority Leader Bruno made some disparaging comments about the minority leader and his house . ''
2007_03_15_1833121	4	Mr. Dopp said that Mr. Bruno , the state 's top Republican , used some vulgarities to describe the relationship between Malcolm A. Smith , a Democrat and the Senate minority leader , and the governor 's posterior .
2007_03_15_1833121	5	The governor , a Democrat who has a reputation for using salty language himself , said , according to Mr. Dopp , '' Joe , I 'm not going to abide that kind of vulgarity . ''
2007_03_15_1833121	6	Not surprisingly , Mr. Bruno 's spokesman offered a different version of events -- though he did not dispute that the meeting was heated . ''
2007_03_15_1833121	7	They talked about trust , keeping one 's word , and from there things deteriorated , '' said Mr. Bruno 's spokesman , John McArdle , who also disputed the description of the vulgarity and tenor of Mr. Bruno 's comment about Mr. Smith . ''
2007_03_15_1833121	8	As far as what they are characterizing , '' Mr. McArdle said , '' he has talked directly to Senator Smith and the speaker and has said very similar things to them directly , and it was certainly not meant in a disparaging way . ''
2007_03_15_1833121	9	Indeed , in a hallway outside the governor 's office before the bill-signing ceremony , Mr. Bruno could be heard grousing to Mr. Smith and Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver , in a more G-rated way , that they were '' joined at the hip '' with the governor .
2007_03_15_1833121	10	The clash came two-and-a-half weeks before the state 's budget deadline and underscored the tense nature of the negotiations .
2007_03_15_1833121	11	The governor has been portraying Senate Republicans as profligate spenders , while Mr. Bruno has said his chamber has done more to lower taxes .
2007_03_15_1833121	12	What precipitated the argument on Wednesday is a matter of interpretation .
2007_03_15_1833121	13	Mr. Bruno had been critical of the governor on a radio show shortly before he attended the governor 's public signing of legislation allowing for the civil confinement of sex offenders after their prison terms .
2007_03_15_1833121	14	The governor 's staff circulated a transcript of the interview , on radio station WROW-AM in Albany , in which Mr. Bruno described himself as '' the greatest reformer in this state , probably since Teddy Roosevelt . ''
2007_03_15_1833121	15	Some lawmakers also said that Mr. Bruno was angry about which lawmakers were permitted to stand at the lectern and speak during the news conference .
2007_03_15_1833121	16	The blowup may not be a bad sign -- Capitol lore has it that such exchanges are necessary to clear the air before deals get done .
2007_03_15_1833121	17	In a previous outburst , now widely publicized , the governor described himself to the Assembly minority leader , James N. Tedisco , as a '' steamroller '' -- adding a profane adjective for emphasis -- who had accomplished more in just a few weeks than any other governor .
2007_03_15_1833121	18	But Mr. Tedisco praised Mr. Spitzer at the signing ceremony on Wednesday . ''
2007_03_15_1833121	19	Thank you , governor , '' Mr. Tedisco said . ''
2007_03_15_1833121	20	There 's no question about the tremendous work you 've done . ''
2007_03_15_1833134	0	The chief of the International Atomic Energy Agency said here on Wednesday that North Korea had pledged to honor its commitment to dismantle its nuclear arms program only after sanctions had been lifted on its funds frozen in a bank in Macao since 2005 , which could introduce a snag in carrying out the accord negotiated with the United States last month .
2007_03_15_1833134	1	In Washington on Wednesday , the Treasury Department concluded a year-and-a-half investigation into the bank , Banco Delta Asia , with the expected announcement of a ban on American banks doing business with it .
2007_03_15_1833134	2	The end of the investigation is expected to lead to the return of part of $ 25 million in frozen North Korea funds , but the amount and timing remain unclear .
2007_03_15_1833134	3	American officials have said that the authorities in Macao , a semiautonomous region of China , would decide those issues , but that only funds related to legitimate activities would be returned , not those connected with illicit activities like money laundering , counterfeiting , and narcotics and weapons trafficking .
2007_03_15_1833134	4	They have expressed confidence that a partial release of funds would satisfy North Korea .
2007_03_15_1833134	5	On the other hand , some American officials say that the nuclear disarmament accord with North Korea is delicate .
2007_03_15_1833134	6	They say that North Korea 's behavior is often unpredictable , and that in the past the North has agreed to something in principle but then has seized on relatively small points in how it has been carried out as a pretext for backing out of the agreement .
2007_03_15_1833134	7	Mohamed ElBaradei , the chief of the International Atomic Energy Agency , spoke after a visit to Pyongyang , the capital of North Korea .
2007_03_15_1833134	8	It was the first such visit by an official of the United Nations nuclear agency since 2002 , when North Korea expelled nuclear inspectors stationed there under a previous disarmament accord .
2007_03_15_1833134	9	The United States and North Korea accused each other of violating the accord that year , and North Korea withdrew from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty shortly thereafter .
2007_03_15_1833134	10	Dr. ElBaradei said North Korean officials had pledged to adhere to the terms of the Feb. 13 accord , which requires that it close its main facility to produce plutonium in exchange for shipments of heavy fuel oil , and allows nuclear inspectors back into the country .
2007_03_15_1833134	11	But he said the officials emphasized that they would not act until the United States resolved the dispute over the deposits .
2007_03_15_1833134	12	The North Korean officials '' mentioned that they are waiting for the lifting of sanctions with regard to the Macao bank , '' Dr. ElBaradei said .
2007_03_15_1833134	13	Referring to the closing of the nuclear complex at Yongbyon , he said , '' They said they are ready , willing and capable of doing that as soon as the financial sanctions are lifted . ''
2007_03_15_1833134	14	The scope and timing of nuclear inspections remain to be worked out in future talks , but Dr. ElBaradei said his trip had been intended to restore ties between his agency and North Korean officials , and he called his meetings '' quite useful . ''
2007_03_15_1833134	15	His visit ended as Christopher R. Hill , an assistant secretary of state and the lead United States negotiator at the six-nation talks involving the North Korean nuclear program , arrived in Beijing for a new round of negotiations on how to carry out the Feb. 13 accord .
2007_03_15_1833134	16	Detailed discussions on various aspects of the accord were expected to continue into next week , and are viewed as essential if North Korea is to follow through on its promise to shut down Yongbyon by mid-April .
2007_03_15_1833135	0	The Miss America organization said yesterday that it had moved the Miss New York competition from Watertown , near the Canadian border , where it had been held since 1982 , to Huntington , on Long Island , more than 300 miles south , so that the pageant could be more convenient for women from New York City .
2007_03_15_1833135	1	The current Miss New York is Bethlene Pancoast , a property manager for 25 shopping centers and whose talent was '' a cappella tap dance . ''
2007_03_15_1833135	2	She is from Brooklyn and majored in mathematics and musical theater at New York University .
2007_03_15_1833135	3	This year 's Miss New York competition will be held July 12-to-14 at the Dix Hills Center for the Performing Arts in Huntington .
2007_03_15_1833135	4	The winner of each year 's pageant goes on to compete in the Miss America contest .
2007_03_15_1833135	5	And the shift in New York locations is one of many changes in the larger competition , once one of the most watched network television events in the nation but now consigned to the narrower reach of cable television .
2007_03_15_1833135	6	The contest moved from its longtime home in Atlantic City to Nashville and other cities .
2007_03_15_1833135	7	In January , the contest drew 2.4 million viewers on the CMT network , down from a recent peak of 25 million viewers in 1995 on ABC .
2007_03_15_1833135	8	Huntington with a population of nearly 200,000 is more than seven times larger than Watertown . ''
2007_03_15_1833135	9	So many of the past Miss New Yorks have been from the New York City metropolitan area that we felt that it was time to showcase our community and play host to the pageant and really utilize all the resources we have on Long Island , '' Dr. Paul C. Brown , a pageant co-executive director , said in a statement .
2007_03_15_1833135	10	By contrast , Miss Americas in the recent past have come from the Midwest and the South , usually from small towns .
2007_03_15_1833135	11	The last Miss New York to be crowned Miss America came from a Watertown competition , but her reign came to a hasty end .
2007_03_15_1833135	12	Vanessa Williams of Millwood -- in Westchester County , 36 miles north of New York City -- served only 10 months after she was crowned in September 1983 .
2007_03_15_1833135	13	She resigned after nude photographs of her that had been taken two years earlier surfaced .
2007_03_15_1833135	14	She has since become a successful actress .
2007_03_15_1833136	0	As he pressed his case to be confirmed as attorney general , Alberto R. Gonzales made a promise to the Senate Judiciary Committee -- and to the nation at large . ''
2007_03_15_1833136	1	I will no longer represent only the White House , '' he testified in 2005 as he prepared to leave his job as White House counsel . ''
2007_03_15_1833136	2	I will represent the United States of America and its people .
2007_03_15_1833136	3	I understand the differences between the two roles . ''
2007_03_15_1833136	4	Yet in one of his first acts in his new job , Mr. Gonzales brought over two top White House aides and elevated a third , D. Kyle Sampson , a Justice Department staff member who had worked in the White House .
2007_03_15_1833136	5	Within days , Mr. Sampson began identifying federal prosecutors to oust , an effort initiated by Harriet E. Miers , the fellow Texan who succeeded Mr. Gonzales at the White House .
2007_03_15_1833136	6	The attorney general 's accumulating critics point to the removal of seven prosecutors in December as evidence that Mr. Gonzales , a longtime Bush loyalist , had failed to distance himself and his agency from the White House and its political agenda .
2007_03_15_1833136	7	As attorney general , Mr. Gonzales became a vocal defender of some of the administration 's most contentious antiterrorism initiatives , including the National Security Agency 's eavesdropping program , for which he helped develop the legal rationale while at the White House .
2007_03_15_1833136	8	Former prosecutors said Mr. Gonzales , relying on advisers who were less experienced prosecutors than their predecessors , took a doctrinaire approach on policy matters , giving front-line lawyers much less discretion on death penalty , gun crime , immigration and even obscenity cases .
2007_03_15_1833136	9	Former prosecutors say that in dealings with lawmakers , administration officials and others who had complaints or were pushing causes , his department took no apparent steps to ensure that its decisions were free -- or at least appeared free -- of political taint . ''
2007_03_15_1833136	10	It 's O.K. for the president to hear and repeat a politically motivated complaint , '' said Harry E. Cummins III , the ousted United States attorney in Arkansas . ''
2007_03_15_1833136	11	It is O.K. for Karl Rove to act on it . ''
2007_03_15_1833136	12	But it is not O.K. for the gatekeeper of the Department of Justice to let it impact what happens inside the department . ''
2007_03_15_1833136	13	Former Justice Department officials expressed surprise that some United States attorneys received inquiries from Republican lawmakers about corruption investigations or voter fraud prosecutions aimed at Democrats .
2007_03_15_1833136	14	It is a practice that Mr. Gonzales should make clear is unacceptable , several argued , by repeating a directive that went out in the Carter administration . ''
2007_03_15_1833136	15	That is not done -- it is a terrible practice , '' said Bruce Fein , associate deputy attorney general under President Ronald Reagan . ''
2007_03_15_1833136	16	It is just highly improper . ''
2007_03_15_1833136	17	Some defenders of Mr. Gonzales argue that some United States attorneys had become too independent of Washington in the past , and say that at a time when the government was conducting a global war on terrorism , it became more necessary for the Justice Department to function more as a team .
2007_03_15_1833136	18	The Justice Department has denied that politics played a role in the dismissals , while acknowledging that the handling of them was bungled .
2007_03_15_1833136	19	Asked for comment about the criticisms of Mr. Gonzales 's performance , Paul J. McNulty , the deputy attorney general , said that Mr. Gonzales '' has great respect and appreciation for U.S. attorneys . ''
2007_03_15_1833136	20	Mr. Gonzales , who worked as Mr. Bush 's legal counsel in Texas and has been propelled since then to ever more prominent positions by the president , is a close friend of Mr. Bush , enjoying movie nights at the White House and visits to Camp David .
2007_03_15_1833136	21	He is not the first attorney general whose close ties to his boss have raised questions about his oversight of the Justice Department .
2007_03_15_1833136	22	Robert F. Kennedy Jr. , who served under his brother President John F. Kennedy , and Edwin Meese III , who was appointed attorney general by his longtime friend , President Ronald Reagan , were criticized for lack of independence from the White House .
2007_03_15_1833136	23	Others , like Janet Reno , who had no previous personal relationship with President Bill Clinton , had serious conflicts with the White House she served .
2007_03_15_1833136	24	Unease over Mr. Gonzales 's management began inside the Justice Department almost from the start , said former prosecutors , some of whom left voluntarily .
2007_03_15_1833136	25	Mr. Gonzales , a former Texas Supreme Court judge who had never worked as a prosecutor , chose Mr. McNulty as his deputy .
2007_03_15_1833136	26	A former United States attorney in Virginia , he had worked for Republicans in Congress for more than a decade and took over the job with less experience as a prosecutor than his predecessor , James B. Comey .
2007_03_15_1833136	27	Their leadership stirred concerns that they did not understand the historic discretion United States attorneys have had in choosing what cases to pursue , or were sufficiently vigilant about preventing political interference in decision-making , the former officials said . ''
2007_03_15_1833136	28	United States attorneys should cooperate with the department and should enforce the priorities of the department , '' a former prosecutor said . ''
2007_03_15_1833136	29	But they also need to be in tune with the needs of their district and should fight for their districts .
2007_03_15_1833136	30	They should not simply be ` yes ' men for Washington .
2007_03_15_1833136	31	There is more pressure to toe the line for D.C. now . ''
2007_03_15_1833136	32	Since the dismissals of the seven prosecutors , some lawmakers acknowledged that they had complained to the Justice Department or the White House about prosecutors in their districts .
2007_03_15_1833136	33	The White House also passed on complaints about lax voter fraud prosecutions , administration offiicials have acknowledged .
2007_03_15_1833136	34	Philip B. Heymann , a deputy attorney general under Ms. Reno and now a professor at the Harvard Law School , said the term that Mr. Gonzales used to describe his position at a news conference on Tuesday , '' chief executive officer , '' demonstrated his lack of appreciation for the discretion presidentially appointed United States attorneys have to have . ''
2007_03_15_1833136	35	He seems to regard the U.S. attorneys as if they are the equivalent of the noncareer employees of the Interior Department , '' Mr. Heymann said .
2007_03_15_1833136	36	Congressional committees are demanding documents that provide more details about the circumstances of the dismissals , and are requesting that White House and Justice officials explain their roles .
2007_03_15_1833136	37	Mr. Sampson , the attorney general 's aide , resigned Monday .
2007_03_15_1833136	38	Justice officials said that they had not known about his frequent dealings with the White House as the firings were being planned .
2007_03_15_1833136	39	Douglas W. Kmiec , a senior Justice Department official during the administrations of Ronald Reagan and the elder Bush said that even if Mr. Gonzales was unaware of Mr. Sampson 's activities , he is still in part responsible for them . ''
2007_03_15_1833136	40	I do n't think you can make excuses for someone at the top of an organization when someone on their staff fails him , '' Mr. Kmiec said .
2007_03_15_1833136	41	Mr. Gonzales may have believed that he had honored his pledge to respect the boundaries between the White House and the Justice Department . ''
2007_03_15_1833136	42	He may have been personally committed to creating this division , '' Mr. Kmiec said . ''
2007_03_15_1833136	43	But did he keep making that instruction clear ? ''
2007_03_15_1833136	44	Correction : March 16 , 2007 , Friday An article yesterday about the close ties between Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales and President Bush misidentified President John F. Kennedy 's brother , the attorney general from 1961 to 1964 and one of President Kennedy 's closest advisers .
2007_03_15_1833136	45	It was Robert F. Kennedy , not his son Robert F. Kennedy Jr. .
2007_03_15_1833137	0	The Coast Guard said Wednesday that it was canceling a contract with two military contractors to develop a vessel for a wide range of missions in the post-9 / 11 world and would instead have the Coast Guard 's own acquisition branch handle the project .
2007_03_15_1833137	1	The deal that the Coast Guard pulled out of Wednesday , involving a joint venture of Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman , is to develop a 120 - to 160-foot '' fast-response cutter , '' which is to be armed with .50 - caliber machine guns , travel at 28 knots or more and be suitable for tasks ranging from patrols of fishing lanes to military operations .
2007_03_15_1833137	2	Development of the cutter is part of the service 's $ 24 billion , 25-year modernization program , which is replacing or rebuilding most of the Coast Guard 's vessels , airplanes and helicopters .
2007_03_15_1833137	3	The program , called Deepwater , has already been hit with cost overruns and construction problems that have embarrassed the Coast Guard and stoked criticism from legislators .
2007_03_15_1833137	4	Adm. Thad Allen , the Coast Guard commandant , said the decision to end the joint-venture contract was made to '' achieve the best value for taxpayers and the government '' and provide the Coast Guard with the best possible equipment .
2007_03_15_1833137	5	The government can cancel or modify contracts far more easily than can parties to private contracts , and Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman are not precluded from other roles in the Deepwater program .
2007_03_15_1833137	6	Margaret Mitchell-Jones , a spokeswoman for the contractors ' joint venture , said in a statement Wednesday night that the Coast Guard 's decision had always been an option under the terms of the original Deepwater contract . ''
2007_03_15_1833137	7	We will continue to provide any support we can to our Coast Guard customer as they further refine their requirements moving forward , '' she added .
2007_03_15_1833137	8	Rear Adm. Gary Blore , executive officer in charge of the Deepwater program , said the decision Wednesday was '' about business '' and reflected the service 's growing self-sufficiency in acquiring the equipment it needed without a middle design layer .
2007_03_15_1833137	9	Admiral Blore said the service would soon seek proposals for a proven patrol boat design that would require '' minimal modifications '' to meet Coast Guard needs .
2007_03_15_1833137	10	The first 12 fast-response cutters are expected to be delivered in the spring of 2010 , the Coast Guard said .
2007_03_15_1833137	11	The service has been under increasing pressure from Capitol Hill as its efforts to remake itself have grown more expensive and been plagued by construction and mechanical problems . ''
2007_03_15_1833137	12	We need a comprehensive fix for Deepwater 's problems before any more taxpayer dollars go down the drain , '' Senator Maria Cantwell , Democrat of Washington , said Wednesday .
2007_03_15_1833137	13	She is chairwoman of the Senate Commerce , Science and Transportation subcommittee that oversees the Coast Guard .
2007_03_15_1833137	14	The subcommittee 's ranking Republican , Senator Olympia J. Snowe of Maine , expressed similar concerns .
2007_03_15_1833138	0	Under attack for improprieties uncovered in its showcase literacy program for low-income children , the Department of Education will convene an outside advisory committee to oversee the program , known as Reading First , Education Secretary Margaret Spellings said Wednesday .
2007_03_15_1833138	1	Facing tough questions at a hearing before a Senate subcommittee considering appropriations for the Bush administration 's signature education law , known as No Child Left Behind , Ms. Spellings also promised to clean up the reading program in other ways .
2007_03_15_1833138	2	In about a half dozen reports in recent months , the department 's inspector general detailed irregularities in the program , which awards $ 1 billion a year in grants to states to buy reading materials and teacher training .
2007_03_15_1833138	3	The reports also found that federal officials overlooked conflicts of interest among private contractors who advised states applying for the grants .
2007_03_15_1833138	4	Ms. Spellings said her office 's general counsel would examine the records of contractors accused of conflicts of interest , and remove those with actual conflicts from any role in the program .
2007_03_15_1833138	5	Her promises came as Reading First faces growing attacks while heading for reauthorization .
2007_03_15_1833138	6	Representative David R. Obey , Democrat of Wisconsin and chairman of the House Appropriations Committee , said this week that the problems with the program '' make it even more difficult to persuade a number of people , including me , to vote to renew programs like No Child Left Behind , '' of which Reading First is a part .
2007_03_15_1833138	7	Acknowledging that '' there 's certainly room for improvement '' in Reading First , Ms. Spellings told the Senate panel Wednesday that her department had removed the program 's leaders ; expanded its staff to seven employees from two , to reduce its reliance on so many private contractors with the potential for conflicts ; and accepted all the recommendations of the department 's inspector general . ''
2007_03_15_1833138	8	I 'd hate to throw the baby out with the bathwater , '' the secretary said , adding that despite the problems , the program was improving reading among poor children .
2007_03_15_1833138	9	At Wednesday 's hearing , Senator Tom Harkin , the Iowa Democrat who is the subcommittee 's chairman , said he , too , was disturbed by the accusations against Reading First . ''
2007_03_15_1833138	10	It has an odor that I do n't like , '' Mr. Harkin said .
2007_03_15_1833138	11	But he said he was not considering eliminating financing .
2007_03_15_1833138	12	After Ms. Spellings left the hearing , Robert Slavin of Johns Hopkins University , whose Success for All reading program was shut out of many states under Reading First , said he did not think the secretary 's promises went far enough . ''
2007_03_15_1833138	13	I have n't seen the slightest glimmer of even intention to change , '' Dr. Slavin said .
2007_03_15_1833138	14	Because schools had already chosen their readng curriculums , promises to clean up Reading First now meant little , he said .
2007_03_15_1833138	15	He compared them to finding eight innings into a baseball game with a score of 23 to 0 that the opposing team had been playing with cork bats . ''
2007_03_15_1833138	16	Then they say , ` From now on , we 're using honest bats . ' ''
2007_03_15_1833138	17	Dr. Slavin said . ''
2007_03_15_1833138	18	I 'm sorry , it 's 23 to nothing .
2007_03_15_1833138	19	You ca n't just say , ` From now on . ' ''
2007_03_15_1833138	20	Reading First was required by law to finance only reading programs backed by '' scientifically based reading research , '' and the Education Department was prohibited from mandating or even endorsing specific curriculums .
2007_03_15_1833138	21	But the program has been plagued by accusations that states were steered toward a handful of commercial reading programs and testing instruments .
2007_03_15_1833138	22	With only two Education Department employees in charge of the vast program , the administration relied largely on private contractors to advise states on their applications for grants , screen products for scientific validity and weigh applications .
2007_03_15_1833138	23	The inspector general found that several of these contractors wrote reading programs and testing instruments that were competing for money , and that they gave preference to products to which they had ties .
2007_03_15_1833138	24	Ms. Spellings has maintained , and said again under questioning Wednesday , that the problems with Reading First occurred before she became education secretary .
2007_03_15_1833138	25	She denied accusations from a former political appointee at the department , Michael Petrilli , who said she had essentially run Reading First from her post as domestic policy adviser at the White House .
2007_03_15_1833138	26	Mr. Petrilli is now a vice president at a nonprofit education research foundation .
2007_03_15_1833138	27	Asked about Madison , Wis. , where educators gave up $ 2 million in Reading First money because they would have had to drop a so-called balanced literacy reading program that they said had been successful for the district , Ms. Spellings said she was unfamiliar with the particulars of Madison 's reading program .
2007_03_15_1833138	28	But she defended Reading First 's ground rules under her predecessor , Rod Paige , saying the program did not exclude specific reading curriculums , but intended only to ensure that they were backed by research .

2007_03_15_1833140	2	A number of those coaches ' former assistants have taken the link one step further , among them : Virginia Commonwealth 's Anthony Grant , who worked for Donovan ; and Xavier 's Sean Miller , who worked for Willard at Pittsburgh and for Herb Sendek , another Pitino disciple , at Miami of Ohio and North Carolina State .
2007_03_15_1833140	3	So let 's play a game .
2007_03_15_1833140	4	Remember the game Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon , which used feature-film appearances to link almost anyone to Bacon , the seemingly ubiquitous character actor ?
2007_03_15_1833140	5	Well , with a little work and the help of Google , it is not hard to link any coach in the tournament to Pitino .
2007_03_15_1833140	6	Some are easy : Marquette 's Tom Crean was an assistant at Western Kentucky , where he worked for Willard , who worked for Pitino .
2007_03_15_1833140	7	Some are not : Davidson Coach Bob McKillop was the high school coach of Southern Methodist Coach Matt Doherty , who played at North Carolina for Dean Smith , who also recruited and coached a guard named George Karl .
2007_03_15_1833140	8	Karl got his first job in coaching working for the San Antonio Spurs under Doug Moe , who was a teammate on the 1972 Virginia Squires of the American Basketball Association with Julius Erving , who played at UMass with a scrappy guard from Long Island named Rick Pitino .
2007_03_15_1833140	9	Each set of links must lead to Pitino .
2007_03_15_1833140	10	If you think it is too hard , here is a hint that could make it easier to connect the dots : Pitino also spent two seasons with the Knicks and three-plus seasons with the Celtics .
2007_03_15_1833140	11	Do n't underestimate the value of the basketball film '' Blue Chips , '' which offers a host of hidden possibilities and led me to my favorite Six Degrees connection : Pitino made a cameo appearance in '' Blue Chips '' with Bobby Hurley , who played at Duke for Mike Krzyzewski , who played at Army for Bob Knight , who coached the 1979 Pan American Games team that included Iowa 's Ronnie Lester .
2007_03_15_1833140	12	Lester was a teammate on the Lakers ' 1985 N.B.A. championship team with Bob McAdoo , who was the technical adviser to another basketball film , '' The Air Up There , '' which starred -- say it with me now -- Kevin Bacon .
2007_03_15_1833141	0	If the first day of jury selection for the former press tycoon Conrad M. Black is any indication , then many in the potential jury pool have not forgotten the corporate scandals of a few years ago .
2007_03_15_1833141	1	Judge Amy J. St. Eve began the process on Wednesday of winnowing down a pool of more than 100 potential jurors in the criminal fraud trial of Mr. Black and three former associates in United States District Court by asking them about their attitudes toward money , titles and tax loopholes .
2007_03_15_1833141	2	One recurring sticking point was the response of many of the jurors to a question of whether they thought there was anything wrong with individuals being paid '' tens of millions of dollars . '' ''
2007_03_15_1833141	3	I do n't think that anyone should get that amount of money from any company , '' one man said . ''
2007_03_15_1833141	4	No one just receives that much out of the blue for nothing , '' said a woman .
2007_03_15_1833141	5	Another man said that when he hears of millions in payments , he concludes : '' Yes , they probably stole the money . ''
2007_03_15_1833141	6	Another woman added : '' When I hear tens of millions of dollars , I shudder . ''
2007_03_15_1833141	7	Many times the judge told the jury pool that '' there 's nothing wrong with making a lot of money , '' and asked the members if they could accept that if they were selected as jurors .
2007_03_15_1833141	8	The judge was asking follow-up questions to written questionnaires , submitted by the defense and prosecution , that the pool members had filled out last month . ''
2007_03_15_1833141	9	Yes , any time someone receives that amount of money , it 's hard to believe everything is on the up and up , '' another person wrote . ''
2007_03_15_1833141	10	Look at Enron and the oil companies -- big profits . ''
2007_03_15_1833141	11	Last year , lawyers for Mr. Black sought to have the case thrown out on the basis that it would be impossible for him to get a fair trial .
2007_03_15_1833141	12	A typical Chicagoan , his lawyers argued in a brief , does '' not reside in more than one residence , employ servants or a chauffeur , enjoy lavish furniture , or host expensive parties . ''
2007_03_15_1833141	13	In their brief to Judge St. Eve -- who denied the motion -- the lawyers even quoted the Bible : '' It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God . ''
2007_03_15_1833141	14	Several times during the day , Judge St. Eve reminded the candidates that the case before them had nothing to do with the collapses or Enron or WorldCom and she expected that those companies would not come up during this case .
2007_03_15_1833141	15	Further , she said , individuals -- and not corporations -- are on trial .
2007_03_15_1833141	16	( One company that was charged , Mr. Black 's private Canadian holding company , the Ravelston Corporation , is in receivership and entered a guilty plea in the case . )
2007_03_15_1833141	17	Other subjects the judge reviewed , in what is expected to be up to three days of jury selection , included whether potential jurists had a problem with companies using legal loopholes to minimize their taxes .
2007_03_15_1833141	18	Another question concerned the bestowing of titles -- in Britain , where the Canadian-born Mr. Black is a naturalized citizen , the former press baron holds a peerage as Lord Black of Crossharbour .
2007_03_15_1833141	19	One male jury candidate said he believed Mr. Black has '' something to do with Britain 's royal family . ''
2007_03_15_1833141	20	A woman wrote in her questionnaire that she thought that someone with a title '' may feel that he/she is better than myself -- untouchable . ''
2007_03_15_1833141	21	Nearly all of the jurors confirmed that they knew little of Mr. Black and those accused with him , Peter Atkinson , Mark Kipnis and Jack Boultbee , and that they had read or heard little about the trial in the media since being selected as potential jurors .
2007_03_15_1833141	22	That fact underscored the incongruity of Mr. Black -- a Canadian born British citizen who has spent little time in Chicago during his career -- being on trial here and facing a potential penalty of more than 90 years in prison if found guilty on the array of fraud , racketeering , and obstruction of justice charges .
2007_03_15_1833141	23	The trial is being held in the only city where Mr. Black 's former company , Hollinger International , was headquartered and maintains its only remaining newspaper holding of note , The Chicago Sun-Times .
2007_03_15_1833141	24	One potential juror acknowledged , however , that she had read a Vanity Fair magazine profile of Mr. Black and gleaned that his wife was '' very beautiful and smart . ''
2007_03_15_1833141	25	Accompanied by his wife , the columnist Barbara Amiel , Mr. Black arrived for the first day of a trial that has attracted international media attention because of his fame in Canada and former presence on Fleet Street in London .
2007_03_15_1833141	26	There he was the publisher of The Daily Telegraph newspaper for nearly two decades until he was forced out of his company in a financial scandal in late 2003 .
2007_03_15_1833141	27	Wearing a gray suit , blue shirt and gray tie , Mr. Black sat at a table with seven lawyers .
2007_03_15_1833141	28	He sat quietly throughout the questioning , sometimes slouching and folding his arms .
2007_03_15_1833141	29	Asked about their attitudes toward Canadians , one man was queried by the judge about his written response that '' they are anti-union . ''
2007_03_15_1833141	30	Another woman in the pool wrote when asked what she thought of Canadians : '' Not much .
2007_03_15_1833142	0	A missing compact disc containing confidential medical and personal information on 75,000 Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield members was recovered yesterday , according to Magellan Behavioral Services , a managed care company that monitors payments for mental health and substance abuse cases of insurers .
2007_03_15_1833142	1	A spokeswoman for Magellan , Erin S. Sommers , said the company received a telephone call yesterday morning saying that the CD , which had been missing since January , was delivered by mistake to a residence in the Philadelphia area .
2007_03_15_1833142	2	The recipients contacted a Magellan office in Philadelphia , she said .
2007_03_15_1833142	3	Magellan sent two security employees to identify the CD , interview the people who received it and take it to the office . ''
2007_03_15_1833142	4	We have no reason to believe , based on our interviews , that there was any improper access to the evidence , '' Ms. Sommers said .
2007_03_15_1833142	5	The recipients were assembling a new audio system when they found the Magellan disc among the packages , she said .
2007_03_15_1833142	6	The coding and password protection for the information on the CD , which included the names of patients , their doctors , hospitals , Social Security numbers and medical claims going back to 2003 , had been removed by the sender , Health Data Management Solutions , a company working for Magellan , she said .
2007_03_15_1833142	7	Health Data Management Solutions is a unit of ActiveHealth Management , a data management company owned by the Aetna insurance company .
2007_03_15_1833142	8	Health Data and Magellan staff members '' had agreed to exchange the data in an unencrypted manner , '' an ActiveHealth spokeswoman , Oonagh Holt , said .
2007_03_15_1833142	9	Both companies said that they were no longer sending patients ' information without coding protection .
2007_03_15_1833142	10	Failure to provide adequate security protection for individuals ' medical records is prohibited by privacy laws .
2007_03_15_1833143	0	When your big brother is also your basketball coach , it can be hard to escape criticism .
2007_03_15_1833143	1	The sibling relationship of A. J. Graves and Matthew Graves will be in the spotlight again on Thursday , when Butler meets Old Dominion in the opening round of the Midwest Region .
2007_03_15_1833143	2	A. J. , one of the best guards in the country , averaged 17 points and shot 95.8 percent from the free-throw line while leading Butler to a 27-6 record .
2007_03_15_1833143	3	Matthew , once a star guard at Butler during the 1990s , is an assistant coach for the Bulldogs , giving advice to his younger brother from the bench , even when A. J. does not want any advice .
2007_03_15_1833143	4	Despite their occasional spats , the Graves brothers remain close , a bond formed while growing up in the small town of Switz City , Ind. , with a population of 311 according to the 2000 census . ''
2007_03_15_1833143	5	A big night in Switz City is probably going to the local movie theater , then to McDonald 's , '' said Matthew Graves , who is in his fourth season as a Butler assistant under Coach Todd Lickliter . ''
2007_03_15_1833143	6	We have one flashing traffic light downtown .
2007_03_15_1833143	7	If you close you eyes and yawn , you 'll miss Switz City .
2007_03_15_1833143	8	There 's a tavern , a fire station , a bank , a post office and a hunting store .
2007_03_15_1833143	9	The gas station just closed . ''
2007_03_15_1833143	10	Whatever Switz City did not have mattered little to the Graves brothers , largely because they had basketball .
2007_03_15_1833143	11	Their parents , Rick and Melonie , will watch the game from the stands at HSBC Arena , proud of what their sons are doing , and that they are doing it together . ''
2007_03_15_1833143	12	Being coached by your brother is like being coached by your father -- not always easy , '' said Rick Graves , sitting in the stands on Wednesday watching Butler practice . ''
2007_03_15_1833143	13	A. J. takes it personal sometimes .
2007_03_15_1833143	14	He gets on Matthew , tells him that he should watch some of the other players as closely as he watches A. J. '' '' Matthew sees everything that A. J. does wrong , and it causes a little tension , '' Graves added . ''
2007_03_15_1833143	15	But would we do it again ?
2007_03_15_1833143	16	Yes , we would .
2007_03_15_1833143	17	It has not been a bad experience by any means .
2007_03_15_1833143	18	And it 's easier for Mom and Dad , because we can watch them both . ''
2007_03_15_1833143	19	Matthew is 32 years old , 11 years older than A. J. Because of their age difference , they did not share the same friends growing up , but their bond was basketball .
2007_03_15_1833143	20	Rick and Melonie have four children , all boys , and basketball became the family pastime .
2007_03_15_1833143	21	At one point , the Graves family had six basketball hoops in the backyard , all set at various heights so that the boys could work on their games .
2007_03_15_1833143	22	A. J. developed into the best player , with quickness and a sweet jump shot honed from countless hours on the court .
2007_03_15_1833143	23	Graves made 137 of 143 free throws this season , including 63 in a row , the third-longest single-season streak in Division I history .
2007_03_15_1833143	24	Whenever Graves misses a free throw , his teammates are shocked .
2007_03_15_1833143	25	Graves was asked to recall the most free throws he had made consecutively while practicing . ''
2007_03_15_1833143	26	One hundred and sixty nine , '' said Graves , breaking into a small smile .
2007_03_15_1833143	27	Watching his brother from the bench and every day during practice , Matthew has learned to appreciate his brother 's talent even more . ''
2007_03_15_1833143	28	If A. J. was my size , he could probably play in the N.B.A. , '' said Matthew , who is 6-foot-3 . ''
2007_03_15_1833143	29	We list A. J. at 6-foot-1 , but he 's barely 6 feet tall , 155 pounds .
2007_03_15_1833143	30	You give him 3 inches and another 25 pounds with his skill level , and he 'd really be something .
2007_03_15_1833143	31	I could never match his ability to get his shot off , his quickness .
2007_03_15_1833143	32	The things he 's able to do , shooting pull-ups and long range , and the way he reads the game , he 's a step ahead of what I ever was .
2007_03_15_1833143	33	I think he learned a lot from his brothers , watching us all play in the backyard .
2007_03_15_1833143	34	He just grew up with the game .
2007_03_15_1833143	35	Our father coached us growing up , and A. J. was always being dragged to a gym .
2007_03_15_1833143	36	A lot of that rubbed off . ''
2007_03_15_1833143	37	A. J. Graves was asked to name the best thing and the worst thing about having his brother as an assistant coach . ''
2007_03_15_1833143	38	I do n't know if I can tell you the worst thing , '' Graves said with a sly grin . ''
2007_03_15_1833143	39	But the best thing is the support .
2007_03_15_1833143	40	He wants the best for me . ''
2007_03_15_1833143	41	Matthew hears from the family if anyone believes he is being too hard on A. J. '' My mother tells me about it after the game , '' Matthew said . ''
2007_03_15_1833143	42	Mom has to be the good cop . ''
2007_03_15_1833143	43	A. J. Graves , a junior , has proved that he can handle the national spotlight , leading Butler to the championship of the N.I.T. Season Tip-off in November .
2007_03_15_1833143	44	During that run , Graves had 28 points against Notre Dame , 20 points against Indiana , 15 points against Tennessee and 26 points against Gonzaga .
2007_03_15_1833143	45	Rick and Melonie Graves also had a blast during that tournament , watching their son play at Madison Square Garden and making their first trip to New York .
2007_03_15_1833143	46	They have been to every Butler game the past two seasons , which is why their Lincoln Navigator has logged more than 100,000 miles in two years .
2007_03_15_1833143	47	The traffic was heavier on Broadway than it was in Switz City , but the Graves managed just fine . ''
2007_03_15_1833143	48	We came to New York a couple of days early and tried to see everything , the Statue of Liberty , the Empire State Building , the United Nations , '' Melonie said . ''
2007_03_15_1833143	49	We rode the subway and even saw the Rockettes .
2007_03_15_1833143	50	It was great . ''
2007_03_15_1833143	51	The Graves family wants this season 's journey to continue , beyond this weekend in Buffalo and into the Round of 16 .
2007_03_15_1833143	52	Whatever concerns the Graves had about Matthew coaching A. J. have disappeared .
2007_03_15_1833143	53	The Bulldogs have been successful .
2007_03_15_1833143	54	And the brothers have become closer . ''
2007_03_15_1833143	55	With the age difference between us , I did n't get a chance to be around him much in junior high and high school , '' Matthew said . ''
2007_03_15_1833143	56	To be around him every day for three years , to watch him grow as a player and a person , it 's been a privilege .
2007_03_15_1833143	57	It 's worked out well . ''

2007_03_15_1833145	0	On a snowy morning last week in Washington , Tiger Woods gathered with several power brokers from the PGA Tour to announce the birth of a tournament .
2007_03_15_1833145	1	The room filled with applause as Woods and Commissioner Tim Finchem christened the AT&T National , a limited-field event with Woods as the host .
2007_03_15_1833145	2	It will be run by his foundation .
2007_03_15_1833145	3	The event will replace the International , a full-field tournament that folded last month .
2007_03_15_1833145	4	Instead of uniform celebration among Woods 's peers , several players have voiced sharp opposition , saying that limiting the field will rob too many players of an opportunity to earn a check . ''
2007_03_15_1833145	5	Some of these guys , me included , have needed those spots , '' Heath Slocum , who has two Tour victories , said Tuesday at the Arnold Palmer Invitational , which starts Thursday . ''
2007_03_15_1833145	6	Those spots can turn around your year or your career .
2007_03_15_1833145	7	I just think for the simple fact that the International was a full-field event , I would think it should be a full-field event . ''
2007_03_15_1833145	8	Golfers who question a Tour endeavor with Woods 's name attached are rare .
2007_03_15_1833145	9	Several have said over the years that they thank Woods every time they see him for raising golf 's profile , which has helped increase the purses that tournaments offer .
2007_03_15_1833145	10	Althought Woods has raised golf 's visibility , a chasm between haves and have-nots on the Tour seems to have grown with it .
2007_03_15_1833145	11	In some ways , the AT&T National only confirmed it . ''
2007_03_15_1833145	12	Obviously , there 's 50 percent of the Tour that thinks it 's a great idea , 50 percent do n't , '' said Rod Pampling , a two-time Tour winner . ''
2007_03_15_1833145	13	Fortunately for me , I 'm on the right side of that 50 percent , so the less field , the more chance I have at winning . ''
2007_03_15_1833145	14	Both Woods and Tour officials on Wednesday separately addressed the size of the field at the AT&T National , which will begin July 5 at a course to be determined . ''
2007_03_15_1833145	15	It 's not finalized yet , '' Woods said . ''
2007_03_15_1833145	16	But we are certainly looking at a reduced field .
2007_03_15_1833145	17	I 've always liked reduced fields because play moves along a lot faster . ''
2007_03_15_1833145	18	When we get enormous field sizes like we do at 156 , sometimes you have a hard time finishing , and if you have any kind of weather delays , you 're definitely not finishing .
2007_03_15_1833145	19	To be honest with you , a lot depends on the sponsors , what they want .
2007_03_15_1833145	20	This Tour is driven by the sponsors and television . ''
2007_03_15_1833145	21	Bob Combs , a Tour spokesman , said Tour officials would hold formal discussions with the players ' advisory council later this month and in April before the Tour 's policy board announces a decision on the size of the field in May .
2007_03_15_1833145	22	The policy board is made up of four players , four independent directors and one P.G.A. of America director . ''
2007_03_15_1833145	23	We have worked hard over the last 10 years to increase the number of playing spots for members , '' Combs said in a telephone interview . ''
2007_03_15_1833145	24	If you take a look from the mid-1990s to 2006 , we had 48 tournaments last year compared to 44 back then .
2007_03_15_1833145	25	We 've done that very deliberately with a specific strategy to increase playing opportunities .
2007_03_15_1833145	26	We feel the strategy has been successful . ''
2007_03_15_1833145	27	At the same time , '' he said of the AT&T National , '' we want to make it special and meaningful in every appropriate way .
2007_03_15_1833145	28	We do n't think to take a new event and having a somewhat smaller field is inconsistent with our long-term strategy at all . ''
2007_03_15_1833145	29	Regular Tour events have fields of 144 or 156 players , but some tournaments , such as World Golf Championships , the Arnold Palmer Invitational and The Memorial ( where Jack Nicklaus is the host ) are trimmed to emphasize players high on the official world golf ranking list .
2007_03_15_1833145	30	Last year , the American Express Championship , a World Golf Championships event , ended up with 60 players .
2007_03_15_1833145	31	The Masters had 90 players , the Memorial 106 players .
2007_03_15_1833145	32	The Arnold Palmer Invitational will have 120 players . ''
2007_03_15_1833145	33	It attracts more interest , and it attracts more interest with the players who want to come and win this golf tournament , '' Palmer said Wednesday .
2007_03_15_1833145	34	Playing host to a limited-field event can also be attractive for a golf course .
2007_03_15_1833145	35	Congressional Country Club in Bethesda , Md. , is the top contender to play host to the AT&T National , and a smaller field means less wear and tear on the course .
2007_03_15_1833145	36	( Michael Leemhuis , the general manager of Congressional Country Club , did not respond to a telephone message seeking comment . )
2007_03_15_1833145	37	Peter Ripa , the tournament director at the Crowne Plaza Invitational at Colonial , said the prestige of playing host to a limited-field event only raises the profile of a golf club . ''
2007_03_15_1833145	38	As a private club -- and many of the tournaments that do host these events are private clubs -- you want to be in the top 100 , '' he said , referring to golf-club rankings . ''
2007_03_15_1833145	39	It 's the fact that we are able to be an invitational with players who have earned their way . ''
2007_03_15_1833145	40	The AT&T National has already made for interesting alliances .
2007_03_15_1833145	41	Woods and Phil Mickelson , long-time rivals who address the ball from different sides of the tee box , have found common ground on the issue of the limited-field event .
2007_03_15_1833145	42	Mickelson said Woods had done so much for the Tour , creating additional income so it can run more events , that he should be allowed to run the new event how he sees fit . ''
2007_03_15_1833145	43	I think it 's important for the Tour to be in Washington , D.C. , I think it 's important for the Tour to have a very strong relationship with Tiger , and that tournament does both , '' he said . ''
2007_03_15_1833145	44	If he wants to take 20 spots away because he wants to have a prestigious event , I think that we should not , as players , as whoever , be narrow-minded . ''
2007_03_15_1833147	0	Fifty Zimbabwean antigovernment protesters who were arrested and beaten by riot police officers in Harare three days ago were freed Wednesday after neither the police nor prosecutors showed up at a hearing at which the protesters were to be charged , defense lawyers said .
2007_03_15_1833147	1	An unknown number , including the opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai , remained in Harare hospitals , some with broken bones and other serious injuries , said Beatrice Mtetwa , a lawyer for some protesters .
2007_03_15_1833147	2	Mr. Tsvangirai suffered a fractured skull and a broken arm as well as unspecified internal injuries , said Nelson Chamisa , a spokesman for a faction of the opposition , the Movement for Democratic Change , which Mr. Tsvangirai leads .
2007_03_15_1833147	3	Mr. Tsvangirai had appeared in a Harare court on Tuesday walking unsteadily and bearing a large bare spot on his head where a wound had been stitched . ''
2007_03_15_1833147	4	It 's a fracture on the side of his head , '' Mr. Chamisa said . ''
2007_03_15_1833147	5	He also has several internal injuries which are being attended to in his chest and partly on his side . ''
2007_03_15_1833147	6	Two of Mr. Tsvangirai 's lawyers said separately that his condition had improved on Wednesday .
2007_03_15_1833147	7	Another prominent critic of President Robert G. Mugabe 's government , the civic leader Lovemore Madhuku , was in the same clinic with a broken right arm , a head wound and heavy bruises on his back caused by beatings , said an official of his organization , the National Constitutional Assembly .
2007_03_15_1833147	8	They and scores of others were arrested and assaulted by the riot police on Sunday after they tried to hold what was billed as a prayer meeting at a sports field in a poor neighborhood of Harare .
2007_03_15_1833147	9	The government has been widely condemned for the attacks , which took place as critics of Mr. Mugabe 's government tried to mount a new campaign to topple his authoritarian rule .
2007_03_15_1833147	10	Zimbabwean authorities have said that the so-called prayer meeting was an illegal political meeting , banned by an emergency declaration , and that the protesters had invited the beatings they received .
2007_03_15_1833147	11	The 50 protesters had been released in the custody of their lawyers and taken to hospitals .
2007_03_15_1833148	0	Brett Kebble was by all accounts a larger-than-life figure -- gold-mining tycoon , concert-quality pianist , raconteur , gourmand , flamboyant benefactor of politics and the arts and , not least , master swindler .
2007_03_15_1833148	1	So it is fitting that the scandal he left behind after his death 18 months ago should be oversize , too .
2007_03_15_1833148	2	Mr. Kebble 's tangled financial dealings have not just roiled South Africa 's business world , where mining is both the epicenter of finance and the engine of growth .
2007_03_15_1833148	3	Now they also threaten to complicate national politics , where the emerging record of his financial gifts and other aid to top figures in the African National Congress is swaying the heated contest to lead the party -- and by extension , to choose the successor to President Thabo Mbeki . ''
2007_03_15_1833148	4	On the face of it , it 's going to have fairly severe political ramifications , '' said Nic Borain , a writer and political analyst for HSBC , the global finance company . ''
2007_03_15_1833148	5	He spent a lot of time apparently currying favor with politicians and possibly even intervening in the succession race . ''
2007_03_15_1833148	6	Much has occurred since the September 2005 evening when Mr. Kebble , 41 , perished on a Johannesburg freeway overpass , shot seven times with a 9-millimeter pistol through the side window of his silver S-class Mercedes .
2007_03_15_1833148	7	Mr. Kebble 's mining empire , once anchored by control of the globe 's richest unexploited gold seam , has collapsed amid a series of frauds , with some of South Africa 's biggest investors squabbling over the remains .
2007_03_15_1833148	8	Glenn Agliotti , a reputed drug kingpin known as The Landlord , was charged last November with Mr. Kebble 's murder .
2007_03_15_1833148	9	He has argued through his lawyers that the killing was really an assisted suicide , arranged by Mr. Kebble days before an audit exposed a billion-rand fraud at one of his companies .
2007_03_15_1833148	10	Mr. Agliotti , in turn , has been revealed to be a close friend of South Africa 's national police commissioner , Jackie Selebi .
2007_03_15_1833148	11	Indeed , Mr. Agliotti admitted to The Mail & Guardian months before he was arrested that he had called Mr. Selebi from near the scene of Mr. Kebble 's murder 90 minutes after the shooting , a fact Mr. Selebi has acknowledged .
2007_03_15_1833148	12	Both have said they were trying to solve the crime .
2007_03_15_1833148	13	Nonetheless , the revelations have provoked calls for Mr. Selebi , the current president of Interpol and a powerful figure in the ruling African National Congress party , or A.N.C. , to resign as police commissioner .
2007_03_15_1833148	14	Mr. Selebi has refused , even after Mr. Agliotti 's diary showed repeated meetings with him . ''
2007_03_15_1833148	15	Does that mean that anyone who has an appointment with him is a criminal ? ''
2007_03_15_1833148	16	Mr. Selebi said in the Star newspaper in Johannesburg .
2007_03_15_1833148	17	President Mbeki has stood behind Mr. Selebi .
2007_03_15_1833148	18	And in early March , South Africa 's elite crime-fighting squad , the Scorpions , executed 29 search warrants around the country , swooping down on Mr. Kebble 's relatives , business associates and members of the African National Congress .
2007_03_15_1833148	19	Part of that inquiry involves accusations that Mr. Kebble made millions of dollars in disguised payments to the party , its affiliates and , in smaller amounts , to other political organizations as well .
2007_03_15_1833148	20	All this is unfolding as Mr. Mbeki and his many rivals in the A.N.C. are publicly girding for a battle to choose the party 's next leader at a meeting in December .
2007_03_15_1833148	21	Whoever wins that job will have the inside track to succeed Mr. Mbeki as president in 2009 -- or if not , to anoint a successor .
2007_03_15_1833148	22	Given that , many South Africans are riveted to the Kebble soap opera , waiting to see where in the party , if anywhere , the inquiry leads next . ''
2007_03_15_1833148	23	In many ways he represents the murky link between money and politics in a democratic South Africa , '' said Hennie van Vuuren , an expert on corruption at the Institute for Security Studies , a South African research organization .
2007_03_15_1833148	24	Granted , South Africa has no monopoly on murk .
2007_03_15_1833148	25	But Mr. van Vuuren and other analysts say such scandals are doubly jarring in young democracies like South Africa 's , where the laws are still being made , political power is still being sorted out and the temptations are unusually great .
2007_03_15_1833148	26	Russia 's democracy was all but overwhelmed in the 1990s by corrupt ties between business moguls and the government , and corruption is a defining problem in many other African nations .
2007_03_15_1833148	27	In contrast , South Africa often seems to be striking back : The Scorpions have pursued a bribery scheme for a government military contract all the way to the door of the former deputy president , Jacob Zuma , who is the chief rival to Mr. Mbeki and a front-runner to succeed him .
2007_03_15_1833148	28	Beyond that , government financial regulators last month accused Fidentia , an asset manager that has courted government favor , with fraud that could approach 900 million rand , or more than $ 121 million at current exchange rates . ''
2007_03_15_1833148	29	I do n't recall a flood of high-profile raids of this magnitude for years , '' said Barry Sergeant , who wrote a book on Mr. Kebble and has followed the Kebble and Fidentia scandals for South Africa 's Moneyweb news service . ''
2007_03_15_1833148	30	There 's definitely a hugely accelerated pace in the response to white-collar crime . ''
2007_03_15_1833148	31	Some supporters of Mr. Zuma argue that the Scorpions and the police have effectively singled out his political machine , seeking to derail his challenge to Mr. Mbeki 's control of the party .
2007_03_15_1833148	32	Mr. Zuma has been accused , and his financial adviser convicted , of receiving hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes from a French military contractor to influence the award of a huge contract for vessels for South Africa 's Navy .
2007_03_15_1833148	33	The case against Mr. Zuma is in legal limbo , but if it is successfully revived , as some expect , it could destroy his ambition to lead South Africa .
2007_03_15_1833148	34	The Kebble scandal also threatens to tilt the political balance in the A.N.C. against Mr. Zuma because of the close ties between Mr. Kebble and Mr. Zuma 's supporters .
2007_03_15_1833148	35	And because the party is guaranteed to dominate the next elections , it also threatens Mr. Zuma 's hopes for the presidency .
2007_03_15_1833148	36	The son of a mining engineer turned Cape wine farmer , Mr. Kebble allied with a relative of the James Bond novelist Ian Fleming to become stakeholders in Randgold , a major gold mining company , and won control of it at age 32 .
2007_03_15_1833148	37	Mr. Kebble spun several major mining companies out of Randgold and concentrated his major holdings in Western Areas , a firm that controlled a fabulously rich gold vein called South Deep in western South Africa .
2007_03_15_1833148	38	In need of money , he sold a half-interest in South Deep to a rival firm , then sold the vein 's unmined gold to other investors for $ 308 per ounce of gold produced through 2014 .
2007_03_15_1833148	39	It was a bad bet .
2007_03_15_1833148	40	The price of gold skyrocketed to $ 721 an ounce last year , and Western Areas found itself selling gold for far less than it cost to mine it .
2007_03_15_1833148	41	But in a fraud that involved moving money through a string of companies and selling shares he did not control , Mr. Kebble maintained the image of a high flier in the gold business and a force to be reckoned with .
2007_03_15_1833148	42	He bought fabulous homes in Cape Town and Johannesburg and established a huge arts award in his own name .
2007_03_15_1833148	43	Most of all , he became a financier of so-called black empowerment deals , a government-endorsed process in which white-controlled companies sold major interests to black investors , often at favorable terms .
2007_03_15_1833148	44	Many of the deals Mr. Kebble brokered involved major figures within the African National Congress , government investigators say .
2007_03_15_1833148	45	In particular , many beneficiaries of these deals and other Kebble projects were in the A.N.C. Youth League , a party subsidiary that is a bedrock of support for Mr. Zuma and a virulent critic of Mr. Mbeki .
2007_03_15_1833148	46	Mr. Kebble was a strong Zuma backer and a committed enemy of Bulelani Ngcuka , a onetime head ofthe Scorpions who not only began the bribery case against Mr. Zuma , but also unsuccessfully prosecuted Mr. Kebble 's father .
2007_03_15_1833148	47	In August 2005 , as the impact of his frauds began showing up on company books , Mr. Kebble was forced to resign as the head of three companies he controlled , meeting a condition of loans from South African investors to keep those companies afloat .
2007_03_15_1833148	48	A month later , his empire falling apart , he was dead .
2007_03_15_1833148	49	Today , under a different leader , the Scorpions are unraveling his dealings and pursuing his financial ties to figures in the A.N.C. Youth League and elsewhere .
2007_03_15_1833148	50	Meanwhile , Johannesburg 's Sunday Times newspaper reported on Sunday that Mr. Kebble 's estate has demanded that the party and some of its leaders return more than $ 3 million that Mr. Kebble gave them .
2007_03_15_1833148	51	Why Mr. Kebble was killed remains a mystery .
2007_03_15_1833148	52	John Stratton , a business adviser and close friend who might shed light on the murder , is in Australia , resisting extradition in connection with the killing .
2007_03_15_1833148	53	Officials of the Scorpions have indicated that they support Mr. Agliotti 's assertion that Mr. Kebble arranged his own death .
2007_03_15_1833148	54	Mr. Sergeant , the journalist who wrote about the garrulous Mr. Kebble , says the suicide theory is nonsense . ''
2007_03_15_1833148	55	I knew this guy over the years , '' he said . ''
2007_03_15_1833148	56	He 's not in any kind of suicide category . ''
2007_03_15_1833148	57	By Mr. Sergeant 's reckoning , Mr. Kebble 's roll-the-dice style eventually enmeshed him in deals with people too rich and too powerful for him to manipulate , and he became their pawn . ''
2007_03_15_1833148	58	They got him in so deep that he reached a terminal phase , '' he said , '' and in the end , he became a fall guy . ''
2007_03_15_1833149	0	With the first full month of the Baghdad security plan completed , the Iraqi military announced Wednesday that the level of violence in the capital had decreased substantially .
2007_03_15_1833149	1	But the degree of improvement was unclear , partly because of the continued confusion over casualty counts here , and an American general cautioned against reading too much into optimistic reports , given that January and February were two of the worst months for car bombings since the invasion .
2007_03_15_1833149	2	The Iraqi review came from Brig. Qassim al-Moussawi , a military spokesman , who said at a news conference that civilian deaths since the start of the plan on Feb. 14 were counted at 265 in Baghdad , down from 1,440 in the four weeks before .
2007_03_15_1833149	3	He said 36 car bombings struck the capital over the past four weeks , down from 56 .
2007_03_15_1833149	4	He attributed the declines in violence to '' the efforts of our brave soldiers , '' whom he described as '' the sons of our nation . ''
2007_03_15_1833149	5	It was not clear what his statistics were based on , though , and they may not have taken into account the bodies found strewn around the capital each day .
2007_03_15_1833149	6	An analysis by The New York Times found more than 450 Iraqi civilians killed or found dead during the same 28-day period , based on initial daily reports from Interior Ministry and hospital officials .
2007_03_15_1833149	7	Historically , these daily counts have underestimated the death toll by 50 percent or more when compared with independent studies by the United Nations , which rely on figures from the Iraqi Health Ministry and bodies found at morgues .
2007_03_15_1833149	8	There is little doubt among American and Iraqi officials that the new security plan has decreased some forms of violence , especially the mass kidnappings and assassinations that generally become apparent from the bodies that show up at the morgue .
2007_03_15_1833149	9	Residents in some Baghdad neighborhoods also report that certain shopping districts have started to come back to life .
2007_03_15_1833149	10	For American troops in particular , the past month has reshuffled Iraq 's deck of risks .
2007_03_15_1833149	11	The overall number of American soldiers killed in Iraq under hostile circumstances since Feb. 14 fell to 66 , from 87 between Jan. 14 and Feb. 13 .
2007_03_15_1833149	12	But with more soldiers in the capital on patrol and in precinctlike bases in neighborhoods , a higher proportion of the American deaths have been in Baghdad -- 36 percent after Feb. 14 compared with 24 percent in the previous month .
2007_03_15_1833149	13	Also over the past four weeks , a higher proportion of deaths from roadside bombs have occurred in the capital -- 45 percent compared with 39 percent .
2007_03_15_1833149	14	American officials , remembering early gains that slipped away during previous security plans , have warned against simplistic conclusions of victory or defeat .
2007_03_15_1833149	15	Maj. Gen. William B. Caldwell IV , the top spokesman for the United States military here , sounded a cautious note on Wednesday at a briefing in which he provided his own assessment of the security plan 's first month . ''
2007_03_15_1833149	16	We know that there has been a decrease in violence , but things still need to get better , '' he said . ''
2007_03_15_1833149	17	We still need to be patient . ''
2007_03_15_1833149	18	General Caldwell did not provide counts of civilian deaths .
2007_03_15_1833149	19	He said assassinations were down 50 percent , but that February '' was an all-time high '' for car bombs .
2007_03_15_1833149	20	According to American military figures , 44 car bombs struck Baghdad in February , out of 77 nationwide .
2007_03_15_1833149	21	In January , 40 car bombs exploded in the capital , out of 73 nationwide .
2007_03_15_1833149	22	Only one other stretch appeared to be worse : during eight days in late April and early May 2005 , 60 car bombs exploded throughout the country -- a rate that has yet to be repeated , according to military officials .
2007_03_15_1833149	23	Car bombs have been a hallmark of the Sunni insurgency for years , and they are among the most difficult weapons to stop .
2007_03_15_1833149	24	General Caldwell nonetheless said that eliminating such high-profile attacks was now the primary goal of American troops across Baghdad .
2007_03_15_1833149	25	Troops have focused raids on suspected car bomb factories , and blast walls have been set up around Baghdad markets to minimize casualties from car bombs that manage to get through .
2007_03_15_1833149	26	General Caldwell 's comments -- combined with praise for the cooperation of Shiite officials and negotiators for the Mahdi Army , the Shiite militia loyal to the cleric Moktada al-Sadr -- seemed to suggest that the military was returning to its former strategy of concentrating on Sunni extremists .
2007_03_15_1833149	27	That would represent a change from American officials ' comments in the past few months that identified Shiite militias as Iraq 's largest threat .
2007_03_15_1833149	28	General Caldwell declined to answer a question about whether any recent attacks or assassinations could be attributed to the Mahdi militia , and he said car bombs from radical Sunnis had become Iraq 's most sinister source of sectarian violence .
2007_03_15_1833149	29	As Sunnis have continued to attack , General Caldwell said , Iraqis in Shiite neighborhoods have exercised restraint .
2007_03_15_1833149	30	He provided two examples : the decline in assassinations typically conducted by Shiite groups as a form of vengeance and intimidation , and the joint Iraqi-American negotiations in the Sadr City district of Baghdad that he said had laid the groundwork for a security operation there that had faced little resistance from residents .
2007_03_15_1833149	31	General Caldwell said that 12 reconstruction projects , worth about $ 3.5 million , had been approved for Sadr City .
2007_03_15_1833149	32	The biggest-ticket item was an amusement park on the neighborhood 's eastern edge that had been requested by the district 's mayor and other neighborhood officials .
2007_03_15_1833149	33	He said the scale of killing over the past week , even with an increase in deaths in attacks on Shiites making a pilgrimage to Karbala , was still below what occurred in the fourth week of the two previous efforts to secure the capital . ''
2007_03_15_1833149	34	This past week is when normally the levels of murders and executions have gone right back to the previous levels , '' he said , adding that officials were '' very encouraged '' that so far , that had not happened this time .
2007_03_15_1833149	35	On Wednesday , a car bomb exploded in the Sunni Yarmouk district , killing one person and wounding four .
2007_03_15_1833149	36	In the northern city of Kirkuk , a suicide bomber exploded a bomb near a restaurant at 11 a.m. , killing 10 people and wounding 15 , the police said .
2007_03_15_1833149	37	In Hilla , a city south of Baghdad , gunmen killed three off-duty policemen .
2007_03_15_1833149	38	Near Tikrit , two American soldiers were killed in separate bombings near their vehicles , American military officials said .
2007_03_15_1833149	39	A few miles from Tikrit , the bodies of Saddam Hussein 's sons , Uday and Qusay , were unearthed and reburied outside a marble tomb where their father 's body was interred after he was hanged in December , relatives said Wednesday .
2007_03_15_1833149	40	The reburial in Awja , the village where Mr. Hussein was born , seemed likely to concentrate interest at what had already become a shrine to a leader who had come to viewed by some as a martyr .
2007_03_15_1833150	0	From the day that Mudhafer al-Ubaidi , 47 , took the job as the head of the Adhamiya District Council in Baghdad , he was a marked man .
2007_03_15_1833150	1	His predecessor had been killed by insurgents in the predominantly Sunni neighborhood four months ago .
2007_03_15_1833150	2	Most areas of Baghdad are battlegrounds , but none are worse than Sunni Arab neighborhoods , where anyone trying to help fellow residents , even Sunnis helping fellow Sunnis , is viewed as a traitor to the insurgent cause .
2007_03_15_1833150	3	On Wednesday , it was Mr. Ubaidi who was gunned down .
2007_03_15_1833150	4	The hulking former army officer was on his way to work at 8:30 in the morning when gunmen opened fire on his car .
2007_03_15_1833150	5	Two escorts with him were also killed ; his son , who was in the car , was unharmed .
2007_03_15_1833150	6	Mr. Ubaidi talked to a reporter in his sparely appointed neon-lit office within the battered gray council building on Monday , just days before his death .
2007_03_15_1833150	7	That day , he loomed over his desk , greeting women on the verge of tears and stony-faced men who had come to tell their troubles .
2007_03_15_1833150	8	Before him on the desk were piles of letters from community members documenting their grief .
2007_03_15_1833150	9	Each letter was a plea for help .
2007_03_15_1833150	10	Written by hand in flowing Arabic script that often traveled to the edge of the page as if the writer had more to say than each line could fit , they documented the battle to survive .
2007_03_15_1833150	11	People wrote because they did not know where to pick up their monthly food ration because the usual place had been closed .
2007_03_15_1833150	12	They wrote because relatives had disappeared in the night , victims of insurgent assassinations or American or Iraqi raids .
2007_03_15_1833150	13	They wrote because their fathers or husbands had died and the family desperately needed to find out how to collect the former breadwinner 's pension . ''
2007_03_15_1833150	14	The government , the Ministry of Interior , the army , all are sectarian , '' he sighed as he struggled through the vast pile .
2007_03_15_1833150	15	Mr. Ubaidi lived in Adhamiya all his life .
2007_03_15_1833150	16	His three children were born there ; he was not about to leave or give up his job .
2007_03_15_1833150	17	But he was hardly an apologist for the government .
2007_03_15_1833150	18	He kept trying because to give up would be defeat . ''
2007_03_15_1833150	19	What else can I do ? ''
2007_03_15_1833150	20	He was on call 24 hours a day .
2007_03_15_1833150	21	He often woke during the night to frantic knocking on his front door as hysterical wives or sisters rushed to his apartment after American or Iraqi soldiers had searched their homes and taken their men . ''
2007_03_15_1833150	22	My wife and I can not sleep through the night , '' he said .
2007_03_15_1833150	23	Mr. Ubaidi himself stood no chance when the gunmen opened fire on Wednesday .
2007_03_15_1833150	24	His car had no armor , and the gunmen riddled it with bullets . ''
2007_03_15_1833150	25	This is the price of our service , '' said a fellow council member named Daoud .
2007_03_15_1833150	26	Daoud 's fellow city council members asked him to fill in temporarily .
2007_03_15_1833150	27	No one else has volunteered .

2007_03_15_1833157	1	Hollywood 's depiction of the 480 B.C. battle between Greek and Persian armies at Thermopylae has been denounced , Reuters reported , by the Iranian government and numerous blogs .
2007_03_15_1833157	2	They complained about how their ancestors were portrayed in the film : the Persian army as far more ruthless and far less intelligent than the Greeks .
2007_03_15_1833157	3	The film , though newly released in the United States , has already shown up in Tehran in low-quality , pirated copies .
2007_03_15_1833157	4	Gholamhossein Elham , a government spokesman , called '' 300 '' an insult to Iran . ''

2007_03_15_1833158	0	After a recent federal study showing New Jersey had the nation 's highest per-capita prevalence of autism , the State Assembly is expected to approve a package of bills Thursday intended to improve early detection of the disorder , plan for better services for adults who have it , and finance the Governor 's Council on Autism , created in 1999 to research causes of and treatments for autism-related disabilities .
2007_03_15_1833158	1	The package also asks the State Department of Health and Senior Services to further study the use of prenatal sonograms , in light of research suggesting a possible link between them and unusual neurological development in laboratory animals similar to features of the brains of autistic humans .
2007_03_15_1833158	2	Though some experts and statisticians have questioned the methods of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study , which put New Jersey 's autism rate at 10.6 per 1,000 8-year-olds -- far above the national average of 6.6 per 1,000 -- advocates for people with the disorder have welcomed the momentum and focus the study has brought .
2007_03_15_1833158	3	The legislative package could help cement New Jersey 's growing reputation for being at the forefront of autism diagnosis and treatment . ''
2007_03_15_1833158	4	The timing is good for this , '' said Paul Potito , executive director of the Center for Outreach and Services for the Autism Community , based in Ewing . ''
2007_03_15_1833158	5	It 's a really great opportunity for our community . ''
2007_03_15_1833158	6	The package of seven bills , introduced by Assembly Speaker Joseph J. Roberts Jr. , a Democrat , also would create a statewide autism registry and set a goal of detecting autism within a child 's first three years .
2007_03_15_1833158	7	The legislation would provide training for pediatricians in detecting the disorder , and for teachers in recognizing its signs and working with autistic children in class .
2007_03_15_1833158	8	One bill would restructure the governor 's council , and another would create a separate task force on adults with autism to plan for their housing , job training and long-term care needs .
2007_03_15_1833158	9	Another calls for special training of police officers , firefighters and emergency medical technicians to recognize signs of autism .
2007_03_15_1833158	10	The cost of the bills has not yet been determined , Mr. Roberts said .
2007_03_15_1833158	11	Gov. Jon S. Corzine has set aside $ 5 million for autism in the state 's proposed $ 33.3 billion budget , but has not specified how it should be spent . ''
2007_03_15_1833158	12	It 's clear that this is an enormous health care challenge in New Jersey , and it 's also clear that early diagnosis and intervention give us the chance to use therapies and other interventions that can be enormously helpful to young children , '' Mr. Roberts said . ''
2007_03_15_1833158	13	New Jersey thus far has been on the cutting edge of the diagnosis and treatment of autism , and this allows us to build on the fine work that 's already been done . ''
2007_03_15_1833158	14	Last month 's study by the C.D.C. , covering specific regions in 14 states , showed New Jersey had the nation 's highest prevalence of autism and related disorders , though some researchers say the higher rates here can be attributed to better records kept by New Jersey schools and clinics .
2007_03_15_1833158	15	Researchers in New Jersey had a median of eight diagnostic records available to them to determine whether a child had an autistic disorder , while researchers in Maryland , for instance , had two .
2007_03_15_1833158	16	New Jersey researchers looked only at Essex , Hudson , Union and Ocean Counties .
2007_03_15_1833158	17	Ocean County was chosen because parents in Brick Township had raised concerns about a high rate of autism and related disorders .
2007_03_15_1833158	18	The study looked at only those regions where researchers responded to a request for proposals ; in addition to the four New Jersey counties , it examined the entire states of Alabama , Arkansas and West Virginia , and parts of 10 others , many of them predominantly urban .
2007_03_15_1833158	19	Some say these differences could mean that rather than New Jersey 's appearing to have an unusually high rate of autism , the state 's rate of more than 10 children out of every 1,000 could be closer to the true national average .
2007_03_15_1833158	20	Mr. Potito particularly welcomed the measures in the state legislation that focus on older autistic people . ''
2007_03_15_1833158	21	Most of the time , energy and money is spent in early intervention and for people of school age , so adults really fall into a black hole , '' he said .
2007_03_15_1833158	22	There is a need for high-quality behavioral and social services for adults , he said , '' instead of tossing people into workshops and hoping it works . ''
2007_03_15_1833158	23	As for the cause of the disorder , Philip A. DeFina , the chief scientific officer for the International Brain Research Foundation , who has a practice in Basking Ridge , cited studies by researchers at Yale and in Sweden that showed disruption of fetal brain development in lab animals after ultrasounds , and a Minnesota study of autopsied brains of autistic children that found a similar pattern of abnormal nerve cell migration . ''
2007_03_15_1833158	24	People feel it is a very safe , nonthreatening procedure , '' he said of sonograms . ''
2007_03_15_1833158	25	However , there is preliminary scientific data that suggests it may cause significant changes in the brain 's ability to organize itself during fetal development , possibly resulting in these kinds of disorders . ''
2007_03_15_1833158	26	After speaking with Dr. DeFina , Assemblyman Joseph Pennacchio , a Republican representing parts of Morris and Passaic Counties , sponsored a resolution asking the health department to pull together any research on sonograms and autism , and to investigate whether any studies have been done comparing the general public and groups who do not use sonograms for religious or economic reasons . ''
2007_03_15_1833158	27	I want to get the discourse started , '' Mr. Pennacchio said . ''
2007_03_15_1833158	28	Certainly this is an epidemic ; we better get to the bottom of it . ''
2007_03_15_1833159	0	Even by the participants ' accounts , the opening steps of the state 's budget dance , often a drawn-out and contentious exercise , were part of a rather choreographed affair .
2007_03_15_1833159	1	One after another , representatives of interest groups came to the campus of Kean University on Wednesday for a Senate hearing on Gov. Jon S. Corzine 's proposed $ 33.3 billion budget .
2007_03_15_1833159	2	They pressed their cases , thanked members of the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee for the public largess and pleaded for reassurance that their programs would not fall yet another notch in the list of priorities .
2007_03_15_1833159	3	Civility aside , legislators and speakers alike privately refer to these sessions as '' cattle calls '' and '' beg-a-thons . ''
2007_03_15_1833159	4	On Monday , the Assembly Budget Committee kicked off the months-long budget approval process in a session at the State House that featured polite and professional disagreements about anticipated revenue .
2007_03_15_1833159	5	( Legislative budget analysts say the state treasurer is too optimistic by $ 653 million over two years . )
2007_03_15_1833159	6	But in the end , the chief budget analyst of the nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services , David J. Rosen , and the state treasurer , Bradley I. Abelow , agreed that they would both probably end up being wrong when a clearer picture of the various revenue streams emerged in May .
2007_03_15_1833159	7	On Tuesday , there was a chorus of 75 agencies that have generally established a niche in the public policy debates over spending and that tend to have bipartisan support -- from the Cancer Institute of New Jersey and the Friends of the Monmouth Battlefield to the Association of Mental Health Agencies and the Anti-Poverty Network of New Jersey -- making their pitches to the Assembly committee .
2007_03_15_1833159	8	And on Wednesday , representatives of some of the same groups showed up at Kean to plead cases before the Senate panel in the second of five scheduled public hearings around the state between now and June 7 .
2007_03_15_1833159	9	In between there will be more than two dozen hearings in which lawmakers will question state department heads on their priorities . ''
2007_03_15_1833159	10	It is repetition , repetition and repetition , '' said Lowell Arye , executive director of the Alliance for the Betterment of Citizens With Disabilities , who has done such advocacy work in Trenton and in Washington . ''
2007_03_15_1833159	11	These are policy issues , and the budget drives policy .
2007_03_15_1833159	12	Every time I get in front of them and tell them our story , the better they will understand the issues . ''
2007_03_15_1833159	13	Republicans and Democrats insist that this year 's budget process should not touch off the kind of wrangling that went on last year , when a standoff over a one-cent increase in the state sales tax closed down government .
2007_03_15_1833159	14	There are no new taxes in this plan , they note , and it provides significant tax relief for the state 's 1.9 million property owners and calls for a modest 2 percent increase in municipal aid and the first increase in school aid in at least five years . ''
2007_03_15_1833159	15	Plus , this is an election year for all of the legislative seats , and the Democrats want everything to go smoothly , '' said Assemblyman Joseph R. Malone III , a Republican from Burlington County and a veteran of 14 years on the Budget Committee .
2007_03_15_1833159	16	In addition , there are new reforms in the process , prompted in part by the investigation by United States Attorney Christopher J. Christie into millions of dollars in '' Christmas tree items , '' partisan and politically motivated budget items that in the past have been inserted at the last minute .
2007_03_15_1833159	17	Under the changes adopted by the Senate and Assembly for this year 's budget , legislators and members of the governor 's staff must submit signed forms 21 days before a June 15 deadline detailing the addition or change being sought , along with the disclosure of any personal or family connection to the intended beneficiaries .
2007_03_15_1833159	18	One adviser to the governor , who spoke on the condition of anonymity , said the changes would speed the process , '' since there is now no incentive to wait until the last minute '' to sneak an item into the document in exchange for supporting the budget .
2007_03_15_1833159	19	Still , others equally familiar with the annual budget process are not ready to concede that there are no new angles being developed to get around this new transparency .
2007_03_15_1833159	20	But none of that was at issue in the hearings so far this week -- except perhaps obliquely .
2007_03_15_1833159	21	Assemblyman Joseph Cryan , a Union County Democrat who is also the state party chairman , made a point on Tuesday to ask the supplicants about the number of years that the state had financed their agencies and to clarify how much of an increase they were seeking .
2007_03_15_1833159	22	He also listed each of the groups that had sought similar increases .
2007_03_15_1833159	23	Later Mr. Cryan said he went through that exercise to show that the Legislature does more than seek Christmas tree items for constituents .
2007_03_15_1833159	24	Last year , according to George J. LeBlanc , the lead analyst for the Senate Democrats , lawmakers made a total of $ 900 million in shifts and additions to the budget -- about $ 215 million from items inserted at the end of the process .
2007_03_15_1833160	0	A convicted killer serving a lengthy sentence pleaded guilty on Wednesday to another murder , for which one of the victim 's high school classmates was wrongfully imprisoned for 16 years .
2007_03_15_1833160	1	The inmate , Steven Cunningham , entered his plea during a hearing in State Supreme Court here , six months after DNA evidence cleared Jeffrey Mark Deskovic , who was convicted of raping and murdering Angela Correa in Peekskill in 1989 .
2007_03_15_1833160	2	Investigators eventually ran DNA recovered from Ms. Correa 's body through a database of samples from convicted felons and matched it to that of Mr. Cunningham , 46 , who was convicted of strangling his girlfriend 's sister several years after Ms. Correa 's murder .
2007_03_15_1833160	3	He was sentenced to 20 years to life in prison , and is serving that sentence at the Eastern Correctional Facility , a maximum-security prison .
2007_03_15_1833160	4	The authorities confronted Mr. Cunningham with the results of the DNA testing two days after Mr. Deskovic 's release , on Sept. 19 .
2007_03_15_1833160	5	He denied his role in the killing at first , investigators said , but eventually confessed to raping and strangling Ms. Correa , a 15-year-old sophomore at Peekskill High School . ''
2007_03_15_1833160	6	I 'm a little bit stunned and shocked at the moment , '' said Mr. Deskovic , 33 . ''
2007_03_15_1833160	7	I just hope that this brings the victim 's family some peace , '' he said .
2007_03_15_1833160	8	Mr. Cunningham pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and felony murder , because the killing of Ms. Correa occurred during the commission of another crime , the rape .
2007_03_15_1833160	9	He is scheduled to be sentenced on May 2 and will receive another term of 20 years to life .
2007_03_15_1833160	10	The clock on Mr. Cunningham 's new prison term will not begin ticking until 2013 , when he becomes eligible for parole on his first conviction , Mr. Chalfen said .
2007_03_15_1833160	11	Mr. Deskovic was 16 when he was arrested .
2007_03_15_1833160	12	He confessed to Ms. Correa 's murder after six hours of interrogation .
2007_03_15_1833160	13	In November , the Westchester County district attorney , Janet DiFiore , asked two former judges , a former prosecutor and a public defender to review the investigation into Ms. Correa 's killing .
2007_03_15_1833160	14	Correction : March 17 , 2007 , Saturday Because of an editing error , an article on Thursday about a convicted killer pleading guilty to a second murder for which another man had served 16 years in prison before being exonerated omitted the given name of a spokesman for Janet DiFiore , the Westchester County district attorney .
2007_03_15_1833160	15	He is Lucian Chalfen .
2007_03_15_1833161	0	In the face of determined opposition from the Bush administration , the Senate on Wednesday began an impassioned debate over an exit strategy from Iraq , headed toward a vote on a Democratic resolution aimed at a pullout of American combat troops in 2008 .
2007_03_15_1833161	1	Underscoring the mounting tensions between the Democratic Congress and the White House , administration officials immediately issued a veto threat , even though the measure is considered unlikely to win final passage .
2007_03_15_1833161	2	The administration 's statement denounced the Democratic plan in forceful terms , declaring that it would '' embolden our enemies '' and '' hobble American commanders in the field . ''
2007_03_15_1833161	3	In the House , Democratic leaders scrambled on the eve of a critical test vote for their own Iraq legislation -- a huge emergency spending bill that also includes a timetable for withdrawal in 2008 .
2007_03_15_1833161	4	It is to go before the Appropriations Committee on Thursday and to the floor of the House next week .
2007_03_15_1833161	5	The White House has vowed to veto that measure as well .
2007_03_15_1833161	6	The Senate 's long-awaited debate over Iraq , twice blocked last month by Republicans , opened along bitterly partisan lines .
2007_03_15_1833161	7	But it was also filled with sadness and dismay in both parties about the course of the war .
2007_03_15_1833161	8	Senator John McCain , Republican of Arizona and a leading candidate for the Republican presidential nomination , acknowledged that '' the situation is , indeed , dire , '' while arguing that it was too important for partisanship . ''
2007_03_15_1833161	9	Political parties do n't lose wars , '' he said . ''
2007_03_15_1833161	10	Nations lose wars , and nations suffer the consequences , and those consequences are far graver than a lost election . ''
2007_03_15_1833161	11	What is at issue is a Democratic resolution that would set a goal of removing most combat troops from Iraq by March 31 , 2008 , and declare that the United States mission must be redefined to find a political -- not a military -- solution .
2007_03_15_1833161	12	Despite the measure 's slim prospects for final passage , Democratic strategists hope that it will step up pressure on the administration and Republicans on Capitol Hill to shift course on a war that , many noted , will pass the four-year mark next week .
2007_03_15_1833161	13	Republicans described the resolution as an exercise in micromanagement .
2007_03_15_1833161	14	Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky , the Republican leader , called it '' unprecedented in the powers it would arrogate to the Congress in a time of war . ''
2007_03_15_1833161	15	Democrats countered that the resolution provided something the Republicans lacked -- an exit strategy .
2007_03_15_1833161	16	Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois , the No. 2 Democrat , said , '' To those who say we would micromanage the war I say , is n't it time for somebody to manage the war ? ''
2007_03_15_1833161	17	So far , support for the resolution in the Senate appears confined to the Democrats .
2007_03_15_1833161	18	Senator John W. Warner , the Virginia Republican , hopes to offer an alternative plan aimed at drawing support from senators critical of the Iraq strategy but uneasy with a timetable for troop withdrawal .
2007_03_15_1833161	19	His proposal would require the top military commander in Iraq to report to Congress every 60 days to determine whether '' satisfactory progress '' was being made .
2007_03_15_1833161	20	If it was not , the president would be asked to justify whether keeping forces there was in the national interest .
2007_03_15_1833161	21	The plan also would call for hiring an outside group to study whether progress was being made in Iraq .
2007_03_15_1833161	22	Senator Lamar Alexander , a Tennessee Republican , said he has been trying with little success '' to convey to the White House '' the need to institute recommendations made by the bipartisan Iraq Study Group . ''
2007_03_15_1833161	23	We need to take it down off the shelf and use it as something other than a bookend , '' he said .
2007_03_15_1833161	24	The timing of a final vote is still unclear , subject to negotiations between the parties ' leaders , who left Wednesday evening without reaching agreement .
2007_03_15_1833161	25	Debate began only when Republicans withdrew a parliamentary roadblock and joined Democrats , in a vote of 89 to 9 , to proceed .
2007_03_15_1833161	26	The sudden shift in Republican strategy was intended in large part to blunt the charge that the party had been blocking debate on the top issue in the country .
2007_03_15_1833161	27	In the House , Democratic leaders convened a series of behind-the-scenes meetings , hoping to hold their caucus together in support of the nearly $ 125 billion spending bill for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan .
2007_03_15_1833161	28	The measure includes a plan to withdraw most troops no later than Aug. 31 , 2008 , in addition to placing conditions on financing of the war .
2007_03_15_1833161	29	Passage of the bill , even in committee , will not be easy , given strong Republican opposition and the panel 's contingent of antiwar Democrats who say it does not go far enough . ''
2007_03_15_1833161	30	I 'm still ambivalent , '' said Representative Jesse Jackson Jr. , an Illinois Democrat who serves on the committee . ''
2007_03_15_1833161	31	On issues of war and peace , members have to vote their conscience , not only listen to their leaders . ''
2007_03_15_1833161	32	Mr. Jackson and several other Democrats interviewed on Wednesday said they were concerned about a number of issues involving the legislation , including the elimination of a proposal to require Congressional approval before the United States engaged in military action against Iran .
2007_03_15_1833161	33	That provision was dropped because of objections from conservatives in the party , but Democratic leaders have promised to deal with it in other legislation .
2007_03_15_1833161	34	Representative James Moran , a Virginia Democrat who also serves on the committee , said he was not delighted with all of the measure 's components but said the compromise was worthwhile . ''
2007_03_15_1833161	35	For those of us who want to get out of Iraq , '' he said , '' this is the only way to go . ''

2007_03_15_1833166	0	For General Motors , there was some positive news to report Wednesday : the automaker said that it earned a profit in the fourth quarter , that cost cuts had progressed faster than planned and that its losses plummeted in 2006 .
2007_03_15_1833166	1	On the other hand , it still lost $ 2 billion last year , the second consecutive year of multibillion-dollar losses .
2007_03_15_1833166	2	The mortgage business of its finance arm needs an infusion of cash because of loans to subprime lenders .
2007_03_15_1833166	3	And some analysts fear that G.M. 's pipeline of new products is not adequate to sustain its turnaround .
2007_03_15_1833166	4	As a result , after the company announced its largest quarterly profit in two and a half years , its shares fell 26 cents , to close at $ 30.25 .
2007_03_15_1833166	5	For G.M. , which is perhaps months away from losing to Toyota of Japan its long-held title as the world 's largest automaker , 2006 was both a cause for celebration and an affirmation of the long road ahead .
2007_03_15_1833166	6	According to figures released Wednesday , G.M. had a fourth-quarter profit of $ 950 million , the most it had earned since the second quarter of 2004 .
2007_03_15_1833166	7	The loss of $ 2 billion for the year compared with a restated loss of $ 10.4 billion in 2005 , when the company began its overhaul by detailing plans to close nine plants and eliminate more than 30,000 hourly jobs .
2007_03_15_1833166	8	Excluding one-time items like payments to employees who took buyout packages and costs related to the bankruptcy filing of its former parts division , the Delphi Corporation , G.M. earned $ 2.2 billion last year .
2007_03_15_1833166	9	Revenue was a record $ 207 billion , up from $ 195 billion in 2005 .
2007_03_15_1833166	10	Another round of G.M. data is expected to be released Thursday , when the company promises to file its annual report with federal regulators .
2007_03_15_1833166	11	That action -- and the release of fourth-quarter financial results on Wednesday -- come six weeks later than the automaker had intended , the result of complexities in the sale of a controlling stake in its finance arm , the General Motors Acceptance Corporation .
2007_03_15_1833166	12	In North America , the focus of G.M. 's turnaround , the automaker earned $ 50 million , although that falls to a loss of $ 14 million when earnings considered to be one-time items are excluded .
2007_03_15_1833166	13	G.M. 's chief financial officer , Frederick A. Henderson , acknowledged that the company 's performance in North America was '' still not an acceptable level , '' despite considerable improvement . ''
2007_03_15_1833166	14	We 've managed to come back from very large losses to running North America at virtually break-even , '' he said . ''
2007_03_15_1833166	15	That 's not the stopping point .
2007_03_15_1833166	16	We need to kick it into the next gear and move it into the black . ''
2007_03_15_1833166	17	G.M. reduced its fixed costs in North America by $ 6.8 billion in 2006 , surpassing its goal of $ 6 billion .
2007_03_15_1833166	18	It plans to cut those costs by at least another $ 2.2 billion in 2007 .
2007_03_15_1833166	19	The company 's North American operations lost $ 4.6 billion in 2006 , including about $ 3.8 billion it spent on buyouts and other one-time items .
2007_03_15_1833166	20	Net earnings improved by $ 5 billion over 2005 .
2007_03_15_1833166	21	Sales continued to slide in the United States , particularly of lucrative pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles .
2007_03_15_1833166	22	G.M. 's overall market share fell to 24.1 percent in 2006 , from 26 percent the previous year , according to the Autodata Corporation , an industry statistics firm in Woodcliff Lake , N.J. '' Our largest concern is cash generation in North America , '' Jonathan Steinmetz , an automotive analyst with Morgan Stanley in New York , wrote in a note to clients . ''
2007_03_15_1833166	23	In that business , where the company is still not generating sustainable cash flow , we see product getting better near term and costs coming down .
2007_03_15_1833166	24	But without a health care solution and with the product portfolio peaking in mid-2008 , auto cash flow is likely to remain muted . ''
2007_03_15_1833166	25	G.M. 's chief executive , Rick Wagoner , conceded that much work remained , saying , '' Nobody at G.M. is declaring victory . ''
2007_03_15_1833166	26	But in a statement released with the quarterly results Wednesday morning , he described the figures as '' validation that our strategy is working , and faster than many people thought possible . '' ''
2007_03_15_1833166	27	We needed 2006 to be a big year , and it was , '' Mr. Wagoner said . ''
2007_03_15_1833166	28	Our performance last year reflects the significant progress we 've made toward transforming G.M. into a more competitive , global business focused on long-term , sustainable success . ''
2007_03_15_1833166	29	Mr. Henderson , known as Fritz , said earnings would improve in 2007 , although volatility in the housing market and rising gas prices suggested that vehicle sales could slow .
2007_03_15_1833166	30	He pointed out that G.M. found a way to earn money in the fourth quarter even though its sales were noticeably lower than they were in the company 's last profitable period several years ago .
2007_03_15_1833166	31	But analysts said they had hoped to see G.M. post a larger profit in the fourth quarter because competition , economic conditions and other factors would create a more difficult environment in the next year . ''
2007_03_15_1833166	32	G.M. 's automotive results are anemic at what we still believe is the peak of the company 's product , pricing and cost reduction cycle , '' Ronald Tadross , an analyst with Banc of America Securities in New York , wrote in a note to clients .
2007_03_15_1833166	33	The company 's global automotive operations earned $ 228 million in the fourth quarter , excluding special items , compared with an adjusted loss of $ 1.2 billion a year earlier .
2007_03_15_1833166	34	For the year , automotive earnings rose more than $ 5.7 billion , to $ 422 million , on an adjusted basis , but one-time charges resulted in a net loss of $ 3.2 billion over all .
2007_03_15_1833166	35	Still , G.M. appears to be in the best position of the three Detroit automakers , all of which lost money in 2006 .
2007_03_15_1833166	36	The Ford Motor Company lost $ 12.7 billion last year and has said it does not expect to be profitable in North America until at least 2009 .
2007_03_15_1833166	37	The Chrysler Group lost $ 1.5 billion last year , but it lacks G.M. 's momentum , and Chrysler 's future is uncertain pending a possible sale by its German parent company , DaimlerChrysler .

2007_03_15_1833166	40	Mr. Henderson insisted that G.M. had enough new vehicles coming to market to keep it moving in the right direction . ''
2007_03_15_1833166	41	We 're not stopping product spending , '' he said . ''
2007_03_15_1833166	42	2007 is going to be a better year from a product launch perspective than ' 08 , but that does n't mean it just goes down from there . ''
2007_03_15_1833166	43	G.M. will take a $ 1 billion hit in the first quarter because of subprime loans by Residential Capital , a division of G.M.A.C. Gains from the sale of 51 percent of G.M.A.C. to a group led by Cerberus Capital Management and other one-time items accounted for about 80 percent of G.M. 's fourth-quarter profit .
2007_03_15_1833166	44	Without those items , G.M. posted a quarterly profit of $ 180 million , or 32 cents a share .
2007_03_15_1833166	45	That is much better than the company 's $ 936 million loss a year earlier , but analysts had expected a profit of about $ 675 million .
2007_03_15_1833166	46	The shortfall was largely attributable to a loss of $ 651 million by Residential Capital .
2007_03_15_1833166	47	Mr. Henderson said the division , known as ResCap , had tightened its standards and moved away from subprime lending to avoid future trouble .
2007_03_15_1833166	48	He said losses from home mortgages should not reflect on how well G.M. was turning around its fundamental business . ''
2007_03_15_1833166	49	When you look at the automotive results , they were pretty much in line , '' he said .
2007_03_15_1833166	50	G.M. originally planned to file its fourth-quarter financial results in January but delayed their release by six weeks because G.M.A.C. needed time to finish calculations .
2007_03_15_1833166	51	The company also released revised results on Wednesday for the five years before last quarter to correct accounting errors related to deferred tax liabilities and taxation of foreign currency translation .
2007_03_15_1833166	52	Profits from 2002 to the third quarter of 2006 were overstated by $ 29 million , and stockholders ' equity as of Jan. 1 , 2002 , was understated by $ 245 million .
2007_03_15_1833167	0	Gary Matthews Jr. , the Los Angeles Angels ' center fielder , said Wednesday that he had never used human growth hormone , offering his first comments about his reported connection to a nationwide drug distribution ring . ''
2007_03_15_1833167	1	I have never taken H.G.H. , during the 2004 season or any other time , '' Matthews said in a statement released through the Angels . ''
2007_03_15_1833167	2	Nobody has accused me of doing so , and no law enforcement authority has said I am a target of any investigation for doing so . ''
2007_03_15_1833167	3	After Sports Illustrated 's Web site reported on Feb. 27 that Matthews was sent H.G.H. from a pharmacy suspected of illegally selling performance-enhancing substances on the Internet , the Angels became frustrated as they waited for Matthews to make a comment .
2007_03_15_1833167	4	Arte Moreno , the Angels ' owner , said he wanted the matter resolved by the season opener on April 2 .
2007_03_15_1833167	5	Sixteen days after Matthews 's name surfaced in the investigation and four days after Commissioner Bud Selig visited Moreno here and implored Matthews to issue a statement , he did so .
2007_03_15_1833167	6	Matthews , who had a career season with the Texas Rangers in 2006 and parlayed it into a five-year , $ 50 million contract with the Angels , is represented by Robert Shapiro , the Los Angeles-based criminal lawyer best known for having been one of O. J. Simpson 's lawyers .
2007_03_15_1833167	7	Matthews said the delay in issuing his statement resulted from his wanting to '' make absolutely sure '' of his status . ''
2007_03_15_1833167	8	In particular , I needed to try to learn whether anybody in authority , in or out of baseball , felt they had reason to accuse me of anything with regard to H.G.H. , '' Matthews said . ''
2007_03_15_1833167	9	If they did , I would have to deal with that .
2007_03_15_1833167	10	It has taken me , and those representing me , 16 days to make certain that 's not the case . ''
2007_03_15_1833167	11	Matthews 's four-paragraph statement did not address why he is alleged to have had H.G.H. sent to him .
2007_03_15_1833167	12	When reporters asked Matthews about that omission , he said : '' I made my statement .
2007_03_15_1833167	13	That 's it . ''
2007_03_15_1833167	14	Manager Mike Scioscia called Matthews 's statement '' a big step '' toward potentially resolving the matter , but he acknowledged that the situation might not be resolved .
2007_03_15_1833167	15	Scioscia reiterated that the Angels would have a contingency plan in center , perhaps shifting the rookie shortstop Erick Aybar , in case Matthews faces disciplinary action from baseball . ''
2007_03_15_1833167	16	I do n't know if it 's totally resolved , '' Scioscia said . ''
2007_03_15_1833167	17	I think , in our mind and in Gary 's statement , we 're relieved that he did n't use the substance .
2007_03_15_1833167	18	Hopefully , we 'll move forward from there . ''
2007_03_15_1833167	19	Bill Stoneman , the Angels ' general manager , told reporters that as long as Matthews 's statement was accurate and '' nothing else pops out , '' the team would not discipline him .
2007_03_15_1833167	20	Selig said in a statement '' it would be inappropriate '' to comment on Matthews 's comments because Major League Baseball was still investigating the matter .
2007_03_15_1833167	21	Tim Mead , the vice president of communications for the Angels , said the team was not '' getting into the nuts and bolts '' of the Matthews matter .
2007_03_15_1833167	22	Moreno did not attend Wednesday 's game with the San Francisco Giants , but Mead said the club was pleased that Matthews had finally said something . ''
2007_03_15_1833167	23	If Gary 's statement is indeed the case , and we have no reason to believe otherwise , than it satisfies what the club is looking for , '' Mead said .
2007_03_15_1833167	24	In Matthews 's second at-bat after releasing the statement , he homered off San Francisco 's Russ Ortiz .
2007_03_15_1833167	25	Before the game , Matthews told reporters that he followed legal advice by keeping silent for more than two weeks .
2007_03_15_1833167	26	When Matthews was asked specific questions about his statement , he replied : '' I made my statement .
2007_03_15_1833167	27	Now I 'm going to go back to work like I always did . ''
2007_03_15_1833169	0	Asked if she believed homosexuality was immoral , Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton , Democrat of New York , initially said Wednesday that it was for '' others to conclude , '' but later issued a statement saying she did not think being gay was immoral .
2007_03_15_1833169	1	Her remarks came a day after Gen. Peter Pace , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , said he should not have publicly expressed his personal view that homosexual acts were immoral and akin to adultery , a position that he said was a factor in his opposition to gay men and lesbians serving openly in the military .
2007_03_15_1833169	2	His views had appeared in The Chicago Tribune on Monday .
2007_03_15_1833169	3	A rival of Mrs. Clinton for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination , Senator Barack Obama of Illinois was asked the same question three times on Wednesday and sidestepped the issue , according to an article in Newsday .
2007_03_15_1833169	4	But a spokesman for Mr. Obama said last night that the senator disagreed with General Pace 's remarks and believed that homosexuality was not immoral .
2007_03_15_1833169	5	Mrs. Clinton supports allowing gay men and lesbians to serve in the military , which differs from the military 's '' do n't ask , do n't tell '' policy , adopted under President Bill Clinton in 1993 .
2007_03_15_1833169	6	Asked on ABC News on Wednesday if she agreed with General Pace 's view that homosexuality was immoral , Mrs. Clinton said , '' Well , I 'm going to leave that to others to conclude . ''
2007_03_15_1833169	7	She added , '' I 'm very proud of the gays and lesbians I know who perform work that is essential to our country , who want to serve their country , and I want make sure they can . ''
2007_03_15_1833169	8	Then on Wednesday night , a spokesman released a statement from Mrs. Clinton responding to the question : '' I disagree with what he said and do not share his view , plain and simple , '' she said . ''
2007_03_15_1833169	9	It is inappropriate to inject such personal views into this public policy matter , especially at a time in which there are young men and women in such grave circumstances in Iraq , in Afghanistan , and in other dangerous places around the world . ''
2007_03_15_1833169	10	Joe Solmonese , the president of the Human Rights Campaign , a gay-rights group , said he was concerned about the initial responses of both Democratic senators and said his group would seek clarification from their campaigns on Thursday .
2007_03_15_1833169	11	He compared their comments unfavorably with the rebuke of General Pace by Senator John W. Warner , Republican of Virginia , who said he '' respectfully but strongly '' disagreed that homosexuality was immoral .
2007_03_15_1833169	12	After Mrs. Clinton released her statement , Mr. Solmonese said , '' I still feel like the reaction from Senator Clinton and Senator Obama merits clarification on their views on the morality of our community . ''
2007_03_15_1833170	0	The Roman Catholic archbishop of St. Paul and Minneapolis has forbidden the participants in a symposium on Catholicism and homosexuality to celebrate a Mass at their conference in Minneapolis this weekend .
2007_03_15_1833170	1	The archbishop , Harry J. Flynn , sent a letter to the organizers , New Ways Ministry , warning that the symposium '' may well cause significant confusion to members of the faithful , '' because some of the speakers have publicly questioned church teaching on homosexuality .
2007_03_15_1833170	2	About 500 participants have registered to attend the symposium , about half of them priests and nuns , and many others parish lay leaders .
2007_03_15_1833171	0	The state 's Department of Juvenile Justice reached a $ 5 million settlement with the parents of a 14-year-old boy who died in January 2006 after being beaten at a boot camp in Panama City .
2007_03_15_1833171	1	The agreement , orchestrated by Gov. Charlie Crist , would require approval by the Legislature .
2007_03_15_1833171	2	A lawyer for the boy 's parents , Ben Crump , said the family would seek another $ 5 million settlement from Bay County , which ran the boot camp .
2007_03_15_1833171	3	A criminal case is pending against the seven guards charged with beating the boy , Martin Lee Anderson , and against a nurse who watched .
2007_03_15_1833172	0	What goes around , comes around , sometimes 60 years later .
2007_03_15_1833172	1	Holy Cross will attest to that .
2007_03_15_1833172	2	As the Patriot League champions , the Crusaders ( 25-8 ) , from Worcester , Mass. , are in the N.C.A.A. tournament for the fourth time in seven years .
2007_03_15_1833172	3	Seeded No. 13 in the West Region , they play tomorrow night against No. 4-seeded Southern Illinois in Columbus , Ohio , six decades after their 1947 ancestors , the surprise national champions that year , reshaped basketball in New England and revised the recruiting of the best New York-area high school players .
2007_03_15_1833172	4	Those 1947 Crusaders in purple-and-white uniforms succeeded despite having to practice at a battered small gray wooden barn in a corner of campus and having to play their '' home '' games at a local high school gym .
2007_03_15_1833172	5	Basketball did n't mean much in New England until then .
2007_03_15_1833172	6	The Red Sox , the Bruins and the Boston College and Harvard football teams were big , but the Patriots did n't exist , and basketball -- pro and college -- was usually ignored .
2007_03_15_1833172	7	The Boston Celtics were about to finish their first season at a mostly empty Boston Garden with a 22-38 record .
2007_03_15_1833172	8	You could drive for hours without seeing a hoop in a playground or a backyard .
2007_03_15_1833172	9	I was a freshman at Holy Cross in the fall of 1947 with a link to the best player on that championship team , George Kaftan , a 6-foot-3 leaper who had been two years ahead of me at Xavier High in Manhattan .
2007_03_15_1833172	10	Kaftan , the star of a great Xavier team in 1945 , had been mildly recruited by Manhattan College and Dartmouth , but a Holy Cross alumnus and the Jesuit priests at Xavier persuaded him to go to Worcester .
2007_03_15_1833172	11	Two other schoolboy stars , Dermie O'Connell from Cardinal Hayes in the Bronx and Charlie Bollinger from St. Cecilia 's in Englewood , N.J. , also enrolled there that year . ''
2007_03_15_1833172	12	I did n't play basketball at Xavier my first two years , and I did n't play that much in Washington Heights where we lived , '' Kaftan , a retired dentist and a former C. W. Post coach , said Tuesday in a telephone interview from his New Jersey home . ''
2007_03_15_1833172	13	The only reason I went out for the team my junior year at Xavier was one of my friends wanted to try out .
2007_03_15_1833172	14	He did n't make the team , but I did . ''
2007_03_15_1833172	15	When World War II ended in the summer of 1945 , Holy Cross added several New York-area players who had been in military service -- Joe Mullaney ( Chaminade ) , later a winning college and pro coach , as well as Frank Oftring ( Brooklyn Tech ) , Bob McMullan ( St. Ann 's ) and Ken Haggerty ( Andrew Jackson ) , who would be the connection to Bob Cousy 's arriving there in 1946 .
2007_03_15_1833172	16	Cousy , the future Hall of Famer as the All-Star point guard on the Celtics ' first six N.B.A. championship teams , was all-city at Jackson , so the local colleges approached him , but he wanted to get away from New York . ''
2007_03_15_1833172	17	Ken Haggerty had Doggie Julian , the Holy Cross coach , write me a letter , but I just filed it away , '' Cousy recalled Monday in a telephone interview from his Florida home . ''
2007_03_15_1833172	18	I went up to visit Boston College , but when they told me there were no dorms , that I 'd have to live with a family , I went home and looked at the Holy Cross brochure that Doggie sent me .
2007_03_15_1833172	19	Holy Cross had dorms . ''
2007_03_15_1833172	20	Julian , originally the football team 's backfield coach , got a $ 500 raise to also tutor the basketball team in that barn .
2007_03_15_1833172	21	The court sidelines were next to the walls .
2007_03_15_1833172	22	The baskets at each end were 10 feet from the back walls .
2007_03_15_1833172	23	There were no bleachers , just one bench at the far end for the players .
2007_03_15_1833172	24	Student spectators stood at the other end .
2007_03_15_1833172	25	During that 1946-47 season , Julian used a two-platoon system .
2007_03_15_1833172	26	Cousy , eligible as a freshman in those years after the war , was on the second platoon with two Worcester products , Bob Curran and Andy Laska , as well as McMullan and Bollinger .
2007_03_15_1833172	27	But as the Crusaders , representing the New England region in what was then an eight-team tournament at Madison Square Garden , surged through Navy ( 55-47 ) and City College ( 60-45 ) , Julian substituted less .
2007_03_15_1833172	28	In the 58-47 title-game victory against Oklahoma , Kaftan , the tournament 's most valuable player , had 18 points , O'Connell 16 , Oftring 14 , McMullan 8 and Cousy 2 .
2007_03_15_1833172	29	All the points had come from New York-area players .
2007_03_15_1833172	30	Some coaches noticed , but a decade later , after Coach Frank McGuire moved to North Carolina from St. John 's and was hailed for recruiting New York players , the real exodus to out-of-town colleges began .
2007_03_15_1833172	31	By then , the Celtics , with Cousy orchestrating the fast break and Red Auerbach lighting up a cigar on the bench , were selling out Boston Garden while Tom Heinsohn led Holy Cross to a National Invitation Tournament title in 1954 .
2007_03_15_1833172	32	And all over New England , kids were shooting hoops in playgrounds and backyards .
2007_03_15_1833172	33	And now , 60 years after Holy Cross was the first Eastern college to win the N.C.A.A. tournament , the Crusaders ( along with the women 's team ) are in it again .
2007_03_15_1833172	34	Not for long , probably .
2007_03_15_1833172	35	Not for a scholarly school with only 2,700 students .
2007_03_15_1833172	36	Their 1947 ancestors won it .
2007_03_15_1833172	37	Nobody can take that trophy away .
2007_03_15_1833173	0	I promise I 'll say this only once , before I settle down to enjoy the frolics of March Madness : All the giddy diversion in the next three weeks is based upon a double standard , the unnatural blending of big-time athletics and education .
2007_03_15_1833173	1	It 's nice to get back to the Bluegrass , with its great tradition of basketball , for the first round of the national tournament .
2007_03_15_1833173	2	One of these years , a 16th seed will beat a first seed .
2007_03_15_1833173	3	It would be fun to be there , although it is not likely to happen here tonight when charming Central Connecticut plays Ohio State .
2007_03_15_1833173	4	Every time I relax my guard and treat this tournament as harmless entertainment , I 'm criticized for being a clueless enabler of a dubious system .
2007_03_15_1833173	5	Last week at the Big East tournament , I wrote about the off year of the University of Connecticut , which has won two national titles , and how its coach , Jim Calhoun , was heading out to stock up on a better grade of player .
2007_03_15_1833173	6	I was relatively sympathetic to Calhoun , whom I like , and I included , without comment , his extemporaneous remark that some of his marginal players just might think about moving on .
2007_03_15_1833173	7	He did n't say he was going to cut them or lift their scholarships .
2007_03_15_1833173	8	He just said they might never get much playing time at Connecticut .
2007_03_15_1833173	9	In the next 24 hours , I got a dozen crabby e-mail messages from readers who prodded me about recruiting abuses and admission standards and graduation rates at big-time schools ( not necessarily Connecticut ) .
2007_03_15_1833173	10	I could only remind the readers that Pete Thamel of The New York Times has been writing regularly about the pipeline of questionable prep schools that have been puffing up the grades of some football and basketball prospects .
2007_03_15_1833173	11	The National Collegiate Athletic Association has hired four full-time workers to upgrade the scrutiny of transcripts , and has identified several dozen prep schools as having low standards , including Lutheran Christian Academy in Philadelphia , which has sent players to Georgetown , Mississippi State , Temple and Texas-El Paso .
2007_03_15_1833173	12	Another diploma mill in the spotlight was University High of Miami , which sent at least 28 athletes onward for college scholarships .
2007_03_15_1833173	13	Many of the players on the 64 teams in this national tournament have better academic backgrounds than these storefronts , but I say it is impossible to fill out the brackets without being aware of the traffic in tall bodies .
2007_03_15_1833173	14	Abuses still exist , including graduation rates .
2007_03_15_1833173	15	Richard Lapchick , the director of the University of Central Florida 's Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sports , released figures last Monday saying that 76 percent of white basketball players receive degrees , but only 51 percent of black players do .
2007_03_15_1833173	16	Ohio State , one of the favorites to win this tournament , had only 10 percent of its basketball players receive degrees , based on freshmen entering from 1996 to 1999 .
2007_03_15_1833173	17	If you include players who transferred , entered from junior colleges or graduated late , 38 percent of Ohio State basketball players earned degrees .
2007_03_15_1833173	18	By all accounts , Ohio State has upgraded its standards since its one-and-done national football championship for the 2002 season with Maurice Clarett , now serving time for robbery .
2007_03_15_1833173	19	There is no law that says a player has to stay in college for the traditional four years .
2007_03_15_1833173	20	One reason Ohio State is seeded first in this regional is that Greg Oden , the 7-foot freshman , is apparently enjoying a year of college .
2007_03_15_1833173	21	He is on record that he very well might turn pro after this year , and more power to him .
2007_03_15_1833173	22	The National Basketball Association is talking about creating some kind of academy to prepare players for a professional career without subjecting them to the structure of college .
2007_03_15_1833173	23	I say there 's no need for academies , as long as colleges maintain standards in admission and class work , and players are free to turn pro when they want .
2007_03_15_1833173	24	I have no problem with athletes like LeBron James going directly from high school to pro ball .
2007_03_15_1833173	25	I have more of a problem with many of the big-time programs that will entertain us in the next three weeks , with their festering feeder systems that include unofficial talent scouts , bogus prep schools , dishonest booster types funneling money to players , and compliant admissions directors , to say nothing of courses and majors that do little to prepare the players for life after basketball , which happens soon enough for most of these people who will have their moment in the next few weeks .
2007_03_15_1833173	26	Having said this , I 'm ready for the tournament .
2007_03_15_1833173	27	Everybody is talking about which team will be the George Mason of this year 's tournament , meaning the charming outsider that made a run to the Final Four last year .
2007_03_15_1833173	28	The real issue is who will be the Carmelo Anthony of this year , a reference to the man among boys who led Syracuse to its national title in 2003 , as a freshman , and then turned pro .
2007_03_15_1833173	29	The two candidates this year are Kevin Durant of Texas and Oden of Ohio State .
2007_03_15_1833173	30	Nothing wrong with that , as long as all the colleges avoid relying on phony prep schools .
2007_03_15_1833173	31	That might be an even bigger upset than a 16th seed beating a first seed .
2007_03_15_1833173	32	SPORTS OF THE TIMES E-mail : geovec@nytimes.com
2007_03_15_1833174	0	A formerly hopeless team , rebuilt around a youthful core and anchored by an All-Star big man , gave a brilliant showing Wednesday night .
2007_03_15_1833174	1	It had the unmistakable look of a rising power in the Eastern Conference .
2007_03_15_1833174	2	Some might even classify the Toronto Raptors ' rapid development as evident and significant progress .
2007_03_15_1833174	3	Two days after Isiah Thomas was rewarded with a contract extension -- a show of faith in the progress his team has made -- the Knicks were roundly thumped , 104-94 , by the Raptors , who came from nowhere to become the class of the Atlantic Division .
2007_03_15_1833174	4	T. J. Ford was too quick , and his very tall teammates kept draining 3-pointers over the Knicks .
2007_03_15_1833174	5	The Raptors hit 12 times behind the arc , and Ford finished with 18 assists and 18 points .
2007_03_15_1833174	6	There were looks of confusion across the Knicks ' faces in the second half , when a 10-point lead became a 13-point deficit , and uniform bewilderment in the locker room afterward .
2007_03_15_1833174	7	Eddy Curry ( 13 points ) said he thought he should have gotten the ball more , although he refrained from criticizing his teammates .
2007_03_15_1833174	8	The Knicks ' guards said the Raptors ' defense made it tough to find him .
2007_03_15_1833174	9	The 20 turnovers the Knicks committed illustrated the problem . ''
2007_03_15_1833174	10	When we get out of character , those are the things that happen , '' Thomas said . ''
2007_03_15_1833174	11	There was a six-minute stretch where we kind of lost our way . ''
2007_03_15_1833174	12	The Knicks never did find it , though they did close within 6 points in the final minute .
2007_03_15_1833174	13	The loss dropped the Knicks ( 29-35 ) into a tie for ninth place in the Eastern Conference with the Indiana Pacers .
2007_03_15_1833174	14	When the week began , the Knicks were celebrating their move into eighth place ( the final playoff slot ) and Thomas 's extension .
2007_03_15_1833174	15	The good times lasted all of three days . ''
2007_03_15_1833174	16	We just got out of sync tonight , '' said Stephon Marbury , who scored 31 points and was the Knicks ' only reliable scorer .
2007_03_15_1833174	17	Curry was 4 for 9 from the field and again struggled at the foul line ( 5 for 11 ) .
2007_03_15_1833174	18	But he felt he should have been given more chances to bully the Raptors ' lightweight front line , particularly the rookie Andrea Bargnani .
2007_03_15_1833174	19	Meanwhile , Bargnani torched the Knicks from the perimeter , scoring 18 points , with four 3-pointers . ''
2007_03_15_1833174	20	It 's tough , because from my point of view , it seems like I 'm open a lot , '' Curry said . ''
2007_03_15_1833174	21	But I 'm not the guard , so I ca n't see what it is .
2007_03_15_1833174	22	I know it 's not personal , I know if it was up to them they 'd get me the ball every time .
2007_03_15_1833174	23	But they 're really just trying to make the right play . ''
2007_03_15_1833174	24	Curry added : '' I 'm not mad .
2007_03_15_1833174	25	At the time , I 'm mad , but after the game I realize what 's going on . ''
2007_03_15_1833174	26	The third quarter was filled with confusion and indecision .
2007_03_15_1833174	27	Curry was called for an offensive foul on an early possession , and Marbury angrily slammed the ball to the court .
2007_03_15_1833174	28	A short time later , Marbury got caught in midair and threw a bad pass , leading to a 24-second violation .
2007_03_15_1833174	29	Ford stole the ball from Curry and converted a fast-break layup .
2007_03_15_1833174	30	Marbury had a layup blocked by Rasho Nesterovic .
2007_03_15_1833174	31	And in the most baffling scene of the night , Channing Frye passed up an open shot to zip a pass at Renaldo Balkman , who was not looking and had it sail behind him , out of bounds .
2007_03_15_1833174	32	While the Knicks misfired , the Raptors hit five 3-pointers and outscored the Knicks by 31-10 during the last eight minutes of the third quarter .
2007_03_15_1833174	33	The Knicks trailed by 11 heading into the fourth and never made a serious run .
2007_03_15_1833174	34	Thomas had a simple solution for the Knicks ' offensive problems . ''
2007_03_15_1833174	35	We got to play through Eddy , '' he said . ''
2007_03_15_1833174	36	And when we play through Eddy , good things happen .
2007_03_15_1833174	37	He needs to touch the ball every time down . ''
2007_03_15_1833174	38	Sometimes , the Knicks tried too hard to follow that directive .
2007_03_15_1833174	39	Steve Francis , starting his second straight game and still finding his way , committed seven turnovers . ''
2007_03_15_1833174	40	I 'll take the blame for this , '' said Francis , who had 17 points . ''
2007_03_15_1833174	41	I turned the ball over entirely too much at the end , trying to force the ball inside , thinking there was something there . ''
2007_03_15_1833174	42	Chris Bosh , the Raptors ' All-Star power forward , started slowly but finished with 22 points .
2007_03_15_1833174	43	Jorge Garbajosa added 20 points for Toronto ( 36-29 ) , which extended its division lead to six games over the Nets and six and a half over the Knicks .
2007_03_15_1833174	44	It had been three days since Thomas signed his contract extension and three days since the word '' ultimatum '' was removed from every sentence referring to his job status .
2007_03_15_1833174	45	At times this season , Thomas had admitted to feeling the pressure . ''
2007_03_15_1833174	46	How about every day ? ''
2007_03_15_1833174	47	Thomas said with a laugh . ''
2007_03_15_1833174	48	The feeling today , I definitely feel it lifted professionally .
2007_03_15_1833174	49	But in terms of approaching the game and competing and making sure that we have an opportunity to win , I feel now there 's even more pressure , because now there 's the pressure to complete '' the task .
2007_03_15_1833174	50	REBOUNDS Quentin Richardson started the game but played only 10 minutes before his lower back spasms flared up again .
2007_03_15_1833174	51	The condition has cost Richardson all or parts of three of the past four games .
2007_03_15_1833174	52	All told , he has missed 12 games and been forced to leave early from two others this season because of the injury .
2007_03_15_1833174	53	Earlier in the day , Richardson reiterated that he has no structural problems . ''
2007_03_15_1833174	54	It 's frustrating , because the game I play , it does n't allow me to rest it right now , '' he said .
2007_03_15_1833174	55	... Steve Francis , who had replaced Richardson at shooting guard , remained in the starting lineup , with Richardson moving to small forward .
2007_03_15_1833175	0	When Rick Pitino walked onto the floor of Rupp Arena on Wednesday , something unusual occurred : nothing .
2007_03_15_1833175	1	There was no thunderous applause greeting him the way it had during his eight years as coach of the University of Kentucky .
2007_03_15_1833175	2	He was not booed , heckled or berated the way he was on the three occasions over the past six years when he came here as coach of the University of Louisville .
2007_03_15_1833175	3	Instead , Pitino quietly set upon the task of getting his No. 6-seeded Cardinals ready for their first-round opponent Thursday , No. 11 Stanford , and what they hope will be a triumphant march through the South Region .
2007_03_15_1833175	4	The mood in the Commonwealth of Kentucky , however , was heavy nonetheless .
2007_03_15_1833175	5	There is an unsettling sense that its basketball universe is out of whack , mainly because this is Tubby Smith 's House .
2007_03_15_1833175	6	It is bad enough that Louisville only had to make the 79-mile drive here for what is a virtual home game , while Smith and his Kentucky team were sent to Chicago , where the No. 8-seeded Wildcats play No. 9 Villanova on Friday in the first round of the West Region .
2007_03_15_1833175	7	Has Louisville eclipsed Kentucky as the commonwealth 's favorite team ? ''
2007_03_15_1833175	8	Yes , we have 90 percent , Kentucky 5 and Western the other 5 , '' said Pitino , trying to lighten the mood but not forgetting to include Western Kentucky . ''
2007_03_15_1833175	9	In Louisville , they have had polls about this , and it is usually 50-50 , but recently it 's 52-48 our way .
2007_03_15_1833175	10	I think football is the reason people have joined Planet Red . ''
2007_03_15_1833175	11	The Kentucky faithful , meanwhile , has been clamoring for Smith 's job all season .
2007_03_15_1833175	12	The Wildcats fans really want this to become Billy 's House ( as in Florida Coach Billy Donovan ) .
2007_03_15_1833175	13	Both Smith and Donovan , who won the national title last year , are former Pitino assistants , as are Holy Cross Coach Ralph Willard and New Mexico State 's Reggie Theus .
2007_03_15_1833175	14	All are in the tournament , all are friends , but only Smith is on one of the hottest seats in all of sports .
2007_03_15_1833175	15	On one hand , most Kentucky fans do not expect the Wildcats ( 21-11 ) to advance past this weekend -- they will most likely play top-seeded Kansas if they win .
2007_03_15_1833175	16	On the other , U.K. fans always expect much this time of year . ''
2007_03_15_1833175	17	He takes it with class and he turns the other cheek , '' Pitino said of Smith . ''
2007_03_15_1833175	18	I would be a lot different than that , and want to fight back .
2007_03_15_1833175	19	It 's about recruits who can play .
2007_03_15_1833175	20	In the pros , it 's about Ping-Pong balls and who is going to get top pick . ''
2007_03_15_1833175	21	The national championship Smith 's Wildcats captured in 1998 -- his first season as Kentucky 's head coach -- is largely discounted here because Pitino had taken many of the same players to the Final Four the previous year .
2007_03_15_1833175	22	In the eight seasons since , Smith has gotten Kentucky to the Round of 8 three times and no further .
2007_03_15_1833175	23	Pitino knows how vitriolic Wildcats fans can be : He dreads bringing Louisville to this building , where he was 107-7 with Kentucky . ''
2007_03_15_1833175	24	I do n't enjoy being a villain in my own house where I spent eight years , '' he said . ''
2007_03_15_1833175	25	I do n't like it .
2007_03_15_1833175	26	It 's an uncomfortable feeling . ''
2007_03_15_1833175	27	It was also uncomfortable for Pitino to have to defend the fact the Cardinals appear to have a decided home-court advantage for the weekend . ''
2007_03_15_1833175	28	It 's meaningless , '' he insisted , noting that when he coached Providence in 1987 , his Friars had to play the University of Alabama at Birmingham in the tournament -- on U.A.B. 's home court . ''
2007_03_15_1833175	29	We won by 28 , so the fans did n't matter too much . ''
2007_03_15_1833175	30	His skills in diplomacy apparently trickled down to his players , who parroted Pitino when asked about how much of an advantage it was playing so close to home . ''
2007_03_15_1833175	31	We do n't count the people in the stands , '' the senior guard Brandon Jenkins said . ''
2007_03_15_1833175	32	We 're focused on Stanford and the things we have to do to win this game and advance to the next one . ''
2007_03_15_1833175	33	Stanford 's players , however , are well aware that as much as three-quarters of the arena may be filled with Louisville fans . ''
2007_03_15_1833175	34	It 's exciting , but intimidating , too , '' the freshman center Brook Lopez said . ''
2007_03_15_1833175	35	Hopefully , people will be cheering for us since we 're playing U.K. 's rival .
2007_03_15_1833175	36	I know the people here are passionate about their basketball . ''
2007_03_15_1833175	37	Pitino really wanted to talk about his '' painfully young team '' -- only forward Juan Palacios and Jenkins played extensively when the Cardinals made it to the 2005 Final Four .
2007_03_15_1833175	38	With nine freshmen and sophomores , Louisville has had to battle back from injuries and immaturity .
2007_03_15_1833175	39	Last year , the Cardinals played in the National Invitation Tournament , and Pitino said that was where they belonged .
2007_03_15_1833175	40	Was it difficult to watch the N.C.A.A. tournament , rather than compete in it ? ''
2007_03_15_1833175	41	It was n't very hard because we were n't a very good basketball team last year , '' he said . ''
2007_03_15_1833175	42	We were entering a new conference in the Big East , and we knew we were n't very talented .
2007_03_15_1833175	43	You do n't complain about what you do n't have .
2007_03_15_1833175	44	You just do whatever you have to to get back into it .
2007_03_15_1833175	45	That 's what our guys have done this year . ''
2007_03_15_1833175	46	But inevitably the questions circled back to Kentucky and Smith . ''
2007_03_15_1833175	47	I know if I was an athletic director looking for a basketball coach , '' Pitino said , sounding exasperated , '' he would be the first call I would make . ''
2007_03_15_1833176	0	Aaron Brooks averaged more than 17 points a game for the Oregon Ducks this season , led the Pacific-10 conference in scoring and helped his team capture a No. 3 seed in the N.C.A.A. tournament .
2007_03_15_1833176	1	But deep down , he is still a zero . ''
2007_03_15_1833176	2	I 'm proud of that , '' Brooks said . ''
2007_03_15_1833176	3	I look around college basketball this year , and I see zeros all over the place . ''
2007_03_15_1833176	4	He was referring not to the players themselves , but to the number on their jerseys .
2007_03_15_1833176	5	No. 0 , which used to be assigned mainly to mascots , has become standard issue for college stars .
2007_03_15_1833176	6	At least 20 tournament teams have had a player in the program this season with jersey No. 0 or No. 00 .
2007_03_15_1833176	7	They include top seeds ( Kansas ' Darrell Arthur ) , bottom seeds ( Jackson State 's Marcus Jones ) and bad seeds ( Georgia Tech 's Lewis Clinch , who was suspended for the season for violating university policy ) .
2007_03_15_1833176	8	They come from Brooklyn ( Arkansas 's Gary Ervin ) all the way to Nigeria ( Michigan State 's Idong Ibok ) .
2007_03_15_1833176	9	They range from 5 feet 10 inches ( Louisville 's Stuart Miller ) to 6-10 ( Holy Cross 's Tim Clifford ) .
2007_03_15_1833176	10	They played anywhere from around a minute a game ( New Mexico State 's Trey Britt ) to 37 minutes a game ( Brooks ) . ''
2007_03_15_1833176	11	No matter who you are , wearing the number means something , '' Brooks said . ''
2007_03_15_1833176	12	It means that you 've got to be more than a zero . ''
2007_03_15_1833176	13	Basketball players generally try to stay as far away as possible from anything having to do with zero .
2007_03_15_1833176	14	A goose egg is the ultimate sign of futility , at least when it comes to points , rebounds , assists and minutes .
2007_03_15_1833176	15	On the surface , zero is a strange and disturbing choice for a jersey number .
2007_03_15_1833176	16	By selecting it , a player seems to be implying that he has no tangible value , that he is worthless , a total nonfactor .
2007_03_15_1833176	17	But the zero 's negative connotation has actually driven its recent spike in popularity .
2007_03_15_1833176	18	Players do not choose the number because they lack confidence , but because they believe others lack confidence in them .
2007_03_15_1833176	19	They believe they are viewed as zeros . ''
2007_03_15_1833176	20	The zero is a powerful statement , '' said Gilbert Arenas , the Washington Wizards ' guard . ''
2007_03_15_1833176	21	It is for anybody who feels unappreciated or feels like somebody is telling them that they are worth nothing . ''
2007_03_15_1833176	22	In other words , it is for the recruit who received zero scholarship offers , zero sneaker deals , zero love .
2007_03_15_1833176	23	By wearing the number , a player is able to embrace his past as a zero and motivate himself to put up bigger and bigger numbers .
2007_03_15_1833176	24	What Michael Jordan did for No. 23 , Arenas has done for No. 0 .
2007_03_15_1833176	25	He chose the number as a freshman at the University of Arizona , after hearing that he would play zero minutes for the Wildcats .
2007_03_15_1833176	26	Agent Zero , as Arenas is now known , was born .
2007_03_15_1833176	27	So , too , was a generation of players who felt similarly dismissed .
2007_03_15_1833176	28	When they looked at Arenas 's jersey , they saw more than a number .
2007_03_15_1833176	29	They saw a message : You think I 'm a zero ?
2007_03_15_1833176	30	Now watch me score 30 . ''
2007_03_15_1833176	31	That 's it , '' said Russell Westbrook , who wears No. 0 for U.C.L.A. '' You go with the zero when you 've been through something and you are looking to get a new beginning .
2007_03_15_1833176	32	It helps you get going again .
2007_03_15_1833176	33	It helps you get the swag back . ''
2007_03_15_1833176	34	The swag , as Westbrook calls it , is short for swagger .
2007_03_15_1833176	35	Zero has clearly come a long way since the days when Orlando Woolridge wore the number in the N.B.A. , simply because it looked like the first letter of his first name .
2007_03_15_1833176	36	In the N.B.A. , No. 0 and No. 00 used to be reserved for the league 's goofballs and contrarians .
2007_03_15_1833176	37	In college , it was often not available .
2007_03_15_1833176	38	Some players assumed it was against N.C.A.A. rules to wear .
2007_03_15_1833176	39	Many equipment rooms did not even stock it .
2007_03_15_1833176	40	But one college kept the tradition of the zero alive .
2007_03_15_1833176	41	Robert Parish wore No. 00 at Centenary , and when he was drafted into the N.B.A. , he took the number to Golden State and Boston .
2007_03_15_1833176	42	It now hangs in the rafters alongside the Celtics ' other retired jerseys .
2007_03_15_1833176	43	Centenary is not in the N.C.A.A. tournament , but fittingly , the team 's best player this season was Tyrone Hamilton , proud wearer of No. 0 . ''
2007_03_15_1833176	44	It 's like my own bull 's - eye , '' Hamilton said . ''
2007_03_15_1833176	45	When I put on the zero , I remember that all eyes are on me .
2007_03_15_1833176	46	I 've seen a lot of guys wearing it this season , and they all seem to have the same attitude -- they want the pressure .
2007_03_15_1833176	47	They want the bull 's - eye on their back . ''
2007_03_15_1833176	48	Last year , a zero carried his team all the way to the Final Four .
2007_03_15_1833176	49	L.S.U. 's Glen Davis became a star , with his Big Baby nickname and a body that looked a lot like his jersey number .
2007_03_15_1833176	50	Davis was as round as a zero .
2007_03_15_1833176	51	But this season , Davis showed up about 30 pounds slimmer , looking less like a No. 0 than a No. 1 .
2007_03_15_1833176	52	L.S.U. did not even make the National Invitation Tournament . ''
2007_03_15_1833176	53	I know it seems like these guys are trying to say they 're just a big fat zero , '' said Sally Faubion , a numerologist in San Francisco . ''
2007_03_15_1833176	54	But in numerology , zero actually portends something very positive .
2007_03_15_1833176	55	It portends very good fortune . ''
2007_03_15_1833176	56	Few of today 's players studied numerology or grew up dreaming of being a zero .
2007_03_15_1833176	57	When Brooks went to Oregon , he wanted No. 30 .
2007_03_15_1833176	58	When Westbrook went to U.C.L.A. , he wanted No. 4 .
2007_03_15_1833176	59	But those numbers were unavailable , so they zeroed in on something new .
2007_03_15_1833176	60	Both of the players were transitioning from high school to college , trying to prove themselves in a new setting .
2007_03_15_1833176	61	No number spoke to their circumstances quite like zero .
2007_03_15_1833176	62	It symbolized where they stood and what they had . ''
2007_03_15_1833176	63	A lot of guys pick zero because it 's like a fresh start , '' said Jermaine ( Dolla ) Beal , who wears No. 0 at Vanderbilt . ''
2007_03_15_1833176	64	But I just picked it because of Arenas . ''
2007_03_15_1833176	65	Numbers go in and out of style , depending on what superstars are wearing at a given time .
2007_03_15_1833176	66	Brooks will probably be in the N.B.A. next season , so it is his responsibility to help Arenas carry the mantle and spread the goose eggs . ''
2007_03_15_1833176	67	I hope it works out that way , '' Brooks said . ''
2007_03_15_1833176	68	I hope zero is still available . ''
2007_03_15_1833178	0	A California judge on Wednesday dismissed charges against Patricia C. Dunn , the former chairwoman of Hewlett-Packard , in a corporate spying case that gained national attention and prompted Congressional hearings on the protection of personal telephone records .
2007_03_15_1833178	1	Judge Ray Cunningham of the Santa Clara County Superior Court also agreed to dismiss a reduced misdemeanor charge against three other defendants in the case once they each perform 96 hours of community service .
2007_03_15_1833178	2	Ms. Dunn and the three others had initially been charged with four felony counts for their participation in a cloak-and-dagger investigation inside H.P. , the world 's largest computer company .
2007_03_15_1833178	3	That investigation was set in motion when officials at Hewlett-Packard , including Ms. Dunn , sought to ferret out the identity of company insiders leaking information to the news media .
2007_03_15_1833178	4	Some of the concrete investigative work ended up in the hands of private detectives who misrepresented themselves to phone companies to gain access to the call records of Hewlett-Packard directors and journalists .
2007_03_15_1833178	5	The case aroused interest in the use of this tactic , known as pretexting , and raised broad questions about privacy in the digital age .
2007_03_15_1833178	6	The news of the developments in the case came hours before Hewlett-Packard convened its annual shareholder meeting in Santa Clara , Calif. .
2007_03_15_1833178	7	It was the first time that Mark V. Hurd had faced investors since being named chairman in September , after Ms. Dunn 's departure from the board . ''
2007_03_15_1833178	8	Let me assure you that no one is proud of what happened last year , '' Mr. Hurd told shareholders . ''
2007_03_15_1833178	9	We need to transform our board the same way we transformed the company . ''
2007_03_15_1833178	10	Federal investigators are still looking into the spying incidents .
2007_03_15_1833178	11	The quiet resolution of the case was a vindication for the defendants , who briefly became symbols of the challenge of balancing corporate responsibilities and individual privacy rights .
2007_03_15_1833178	12	It came after several weeks of negotiations between lawyers for the defendants and the office of the California state attorney general , Jerry Brown .
2007_03_15_1833178	13	The attorney general 's office ultimately endorsed the dismissal of charges against Ms. Dunn and reduced the charges against the three others : Kevin T. Hunsaker , a former company lawyer , and two private investigators , Ronald R. DeLia and Matthew DePante .
2007_03_15_1833178	14	Lawyers for the defendants argued that their clients did not commit a crime , in part because they acted without criminal intent .
2007_03_15_1833178	15	James J. Brosnahan , a lawyer for Ms. Dunn , said she consulted accomplished lawyers before approving an investigation that ultimately involved pretexting , and was told that she was acting within the law . ''
2007_03_15_1833178	16	She received the benefit of advice that what was being done was perfectly legal . ''
2007_03_15_1833178	17	Mr. Brosnahan added . ''
2007_03_15_1833178	18	She never had the slightest criminal intent . ''
2007_03_15_1833178	19	While ignorance of the law is not a defense , Mr. Brosnahan said there were other considerations , including the fact that the pretexting laws were in flux at the time of the offense . ''
2007_03_15_1833178	20	The law was shifting and changing , '' he said . ''
2007_03_15_1833178	21	This resolution recognizes they may have gotten caught up in a changing legal landscape . ''
2007_03_15_1833178	22	Joseph A. Grundfest , a professor of law and business at Stanford University , said another important factor could have been the changing political landscape .
2007_03_15_1833178	23	The charges against the defendants were brought by the former attorney general , Bill Lockyer , who was elected California state treasurer in November . ''
2007_03_15_1833178	24	The one important thing that 's changed between now and then was an election , '' Mr. Grundfest said . ''
2007_03_15_1833178	25	The indictment was brought by an official on the eve of seeking election , and the dismissal and reductions of charges were brought by an official that had just been elected . ''
2007_03_15_1833178	26	A spokesman for Mr. Brown , Nathan Barankin , said officials had not made a mistake in bringing charges against the defendants .
2007_03_15_1833178	27	He would not directly address whether politics had played a role in the filing of charges or their ultimate outcome . ''
2007_03_15_1833178	28	Criminal complaints are filed all the time , and it 's a judge who determines the appropriate sentence , '' Mr. Barankin said .
2007_03_15_1833178	29	He said the resolution of the case had been proposed by the court and agreed to by the attorney general .
2007_03_15_1833178	30	The case stemmed from an internal investigation at Hewlett-Packard that was started by Ms. Dunn in 2005 and aimed at finding the sources of apparent leaks to journalists from the board .
2007_03_15_1833178	31	The first phase of the investigation ended inconclusively , but the hunt started again in January 2006 , after more articles that appeared to contain information from directors .
2007_03_15_1833178	32	The investigation ultimately involved the hiring of outside investigators , who obtained personal phone records of board members and journalists in an effort to find connections between them and ferret out the source of leaks .
2007_03_15_1833178	33	Prosecutors asserted that the chain of investigators included Mr. DeLia , a Boston-area private detective ; Mr. DePante , manager of the Action Research Group , an information broker in Melbourne , Fla. ; and Bryan Wagner of Littleton , Colo. , who worked for Mr. DePante gathering phone records .
2007_03_15_1833178	34	The original criminal complaint said that pretexting was involved in the obtaining of records from 24 individuals ' homes , offices , cellphones and fax numbers .
2007_03_15_1833178	35	Mr. Wagner , who was at the bottom of the investigative chain , later pleaded guilty to federal pretexting charges , the one conviction in the case .
2007_03_15_1833178	36	But the fallout was broader , including the resignations of Ms. Dunn , Mr. Hunsaker and Ann O. Baskins , the company 's top lawyer .
2007_03_15_1833178	37	Mr. Barankin said the case also brought wider attention to pretexting and has led to a decline in the use of the practice .
2007_03_15_1833178	38	He cited information provided by telephone companies . ''
2007_03_15_1833178	39	Since the case was filed , the amount of pretexting going on in the entire country has fallen dramatically , '' Mr. Barankin said .
2007_03_15_1833178	40	Ms. Dunn 's case was complicated by the fact that she is suffering from late-stage ovarian cancer .
2007_03_15_1833178	41	Her lawyer , Mr. Brosnahan , said Judge Cunningham indicated that her health was among the factors involved in the dismissal of charges , but not the overriding one .
2007_03_15_1833178	42	The dismissal '' was much more on the merits than it was on her health , '' Mr. Brosnahan said .
2007_03_15_1833178	43	In a statement , Ms. Dunn said , '' I am pleased that this matter has been resolved fairly , and want to express my deep gratitude to my husband and family , who never lost faith in me throughout this ordeal . ''
2007_03_15_1833178	44	At the start of the shareholder meeting 's question-and-answer session on Wednesday , Mr. Hurd said he would not talk about Ms. Dunn or the resolution of the case .
2007_03_15_1833178	45	Shareholders appeared to give Mr. Hurd a vote of confidence at the meeting and indicated that they thought last year 's problems were now squarely behind the company .
2007_03_15_1833178	46	They voted to re-elect all eight members of the current board , and voted down a proposal to allow stockholders to nominate up to two board candidates , leaving the responsibility with Mr. Hurd and the other directors .
2007_03_15_1833178	47	That proposal , which gained about 39 percent of the shares voted on Wednesday , was fiercely opposed by H.P. executives , who said the board already accommodated shareholder input .
2007_03_15_1833178	48	Proponents of the proposal said that it would have prevented the company from electing directors who represented '' special interests , '' and that it was an appropriate response to the spying scandal . ''
2007_03_15_1833178	49	The board of H.P. has exemplified dysfunction , '' said Scott Adams , a spokesman for the pension fund of the American Federation of State , County and Municipal Employees , which sponsored the proposal along with the New York State Common Retirement Fund and several other funds . ''
2007_03_15_1833178	50	The board 's greatest contribution in 2006 was introducing the word ` pretexting ' into the American lexicon . ''
2007_03_15_1833178	51	Mr. Hurd moved to assure shareholders that the company was back on track . ''
2007_03_15_1833178	52	There 's been solid progress across H.P. , '' he said . ''
2007_03_15_1833178	53	We are committed to executing with discipline . ''
2007_03_15_1833179	0	In mid-January , Mohamed El-Erian , head of the $ 30 billion Harvard Endowment , made a $ 1.6 billion bet that markets around the world were overvalued , and he sold off stocks representing 5 percent of Harvard 's total portfolio .
2007_03_15_1833179	1	With the Dow Jones industrial average down about 3.5 percent since then , his hunch paid off . ''
2007_03_15_1833179	2	We had been in a global Goldilocks world , '' said the Cambridge University-trained economist who came to Harvard a year ago after seven years of running the Pacific Investment Management Company Emerging Markets Bond Fund . ''
2007_03_15_1833179	3	We felt that valuations were stretched and that they had gone up too quickly and we were reminded of May of 2006 where there were similar signals that people were stretching for returns , '' he added . ''
2007_03_15_1833179	4	The world has become increasingly connected , so we made the adjustments across the board . ''
2007_03_15_1833179	5	It is just one example of how Mr. El-Erian , 48 , is setting a new course for the endowment after succeeding his highly regarded predecessor , Jack Meyer .
2007_03_15_1833179	6	Mr. Meyer was fond of saying that he had no clue which way the stock market would go , and generally did not change Harvard 's asset mix to try to time the market .
2007_03_15_1833179	7	( He preferred betting on opportunities he spotted in fixed-income securities . )
2007_03_15_1833179	8	If only Mr. El-Erian just had to worry about market moves .
2007_03_15_1833179	9	He and the board of the Harvard Management Company , which oversees the endowment , are also discussing the controversial issue of pay packages for top managers .
2007_03_15_1833179	10	And he is on a charm offensive , trying to be more visible among administrators at Harvard , an effort , in part , to make the university more comfortable with the endowment 's strategies .
2007_03_15_1833179	11	Those strategies are still being refined -- including just how much money Harvard should manage itself and how much it should hand over to outside managers .
2007_03_15_1833179	12	Though a number of major endowments do not trade stocks in-house because of the perils of market timing , Mr. El-Erian says he believes that Harvard , which invests in an array of interrelated assets , has an edge understanding what may affect their values .
2007_03_15_1833179	13	Even Mr. El-Erian 's small decisions can have an enormous impact .
2007_03_15_1833179	14	Last year , Harvard counted on the endowment , the largest in the nation , for roughly $ 1 billion , or about a third , of its annual $ 3 billion budget .
2007_03_15_1833179	15	The biggest chunk of the endowment funding goes for financial aid .
2007_03_15_1833179	16	Given the intense scrutiny of Harvard 's every move , it can still seem a mystery why Mr. El-Erian made the shift in the first place .
2007_03_15_1833179	17	Certainly it was not for the money .
2007_03_15_1833179	18	Although Mr. El-Erian will not discuss it , several people who know him say he made tens of millions more at Pimco , where he oversaw $ 28 billion in emerging market debt .
2007_03_15_1833179	19	And he is breaking a basic rule of career management -- that it is better to follow someone in a job who did poorly rather than someone who did well ( and Mr. Meyer did very well , earning an average return of 15.9 percent a year over his nearly 15-year tenure running the endowment ) .
2007_03_15_1833179	20	Mr. Meyer 's performance was second only to David Swensen of Yale , who has produced annual returns of 16.3 percent over 21 years .
2007_03_15_1833179	21	A slender man who talks with a slight European accent , Mr. El-Erian said during a recent interview in his office overlooking Boston Harbor that he took the post because it was a new challenge that still lets him continue doing what he loves : investing , but in an academic context .
2007_03_15_1833179	22	And the mission is clear -- to make money for Harvard and to let it think '' in bold terms , '' he said .
2007_03_15_1833179	23	Another appeal of the job is that he does not have to see new clients or worry about capital withdrawals .
2007_03_15_1833179	24	The endowment is huge , comparable only in the nonprofit world to the $ 33 billion foundation started by Bill Gates that Warren E. Buffett has agreed to help finance .
2007_03_15_1833179	25	It is much bigger than Yale 's $ 18 billion fund .
2007_03_15_1833179	26	Mr. El-Erian faces enormous pressure to deliver returns across a range of asset classes -- often where he has no previous expertise .
2007_03_15_1833179	27	And the managers of the Harvard funds are expected to provide world-class returns , yet face criticism when their pay is compared with that of the professors and administrators .
2007_03_15_1833179	28	Harvard has to disclose how much it pays its top financial managers .
2007_03_15_1833179	29	In fiscal 2005 , Mr. Meyer earned $ 6 million , and two other managers earned about $ 17 million each .
2007_03_15_1833179	30	Those figures -- which had been higher in earlier years -- drew sharp criticism from others at Harvard that the team was earning unseemly amounts , given academic pay levels .
2007_03_15_1833179	31	Mr. Swensen , the Yale investment chief who made $ 1.6 million last year and does not have any in-house managers , said he was not surprised at the friction . ''
2007_03_15_1833179	32	Paying some people $ 35 million where others earn $ 35,000 tears at the fabric of an institution , '' he said .
2007_03_15_1833179	33	At Harvard , the tension between the university and the endowment has come at a price .
2007_03_15_1833179	34	Some of its best money managers have left to start their own firms .
2007_03_15_1833179	35	And last year , partly out of exasperation with his critics , Mr. Meyer quit , taking roughly 30 of his 150-person staff with him to start Convexity Capital Management .
2007_03_15_1833179	36	In fiscal 2006 , ended June 30 , Mr. El-Erian , who was at Harvard only for half the fiscal year , earned $ 2.3 million .
2007_03_15_1833179	37	For now , the new team 's compensation will continue to depend on how much money is managed in-house and what their returns are over a period of years , rather than just a single year .
2007_03_15_1833179	38	Harvard will still have a significant portion of its money managed by people working for Harvard .
2007_03_15_1833179	39	They will continue to take home far more money than the academics -- if they earn billions for Harvard . ''
2007_03_15_1833179	40	The easiest thing would have been : let 's not rebuild the internal management team , '' Mr. El-Erian said .
2007_03_15_1833179	41	But he added : '' Manager selection is absolutely critical , and a lot of good outside managers do n't have room anymore , '' alluding to hedge funds and private equity funds that are either closed to new money or will let a new investor put in only a limited amount of capital .
2007_03_15_1833179	42	Mr. El-Erian , who is married with a 3-year-old daughter , starts his day on the trading floor at 6 a.m. and spends afternoons interviewing new recruits .
2007_03_15_1833179	43	A challenge has been that '' we can not press a pause button on the stock market while we get our act together , '' he said .
2007_03_15_1833179	44	He points out that if Harvard chooses to leverage its bets , it has such a strong balance sheet that it can borrow at favorable rates .
2007_03_15_1833179	45	Its long-term horizon also lets it consider investments that might not pay off for years , and exposure to a panoply of asset classes can help it gain insights into economic developments .
2007_03_15_1833179	46	The result may be that some managers leave , '' but that means they are successful and the endowment has benefited , '' Mr. El-Erian said .
2007_03_15_1833179	47	Mr. El-Erian seems eager to help bridge the gap between the endowment and the university .
2007_03_15_1833179	48	Harvard 's vice president for finance , Elizabeth Mora , said that under previous management '' it was not the culture of the place to be as integrated with the university . '' ''
2007_03_15_1833179	49	Mohamed makes it an active part of his itinerary .
2007_03_15_1833179	50	He came over on Friday and addressed the administrative heads of all the schools , giving a presentation on the endowment and the structure of the management company . ''
2007_03_15_1833179	51	His family 's background offers some insights into what has drawn him to the academic world .
2007_03_15_1833179	52	Born to an Egyptian father and a French mother , Mr. El-Erian was educated in the United States , Egypt , France and Britain and got a degree in economics at Cambridge University and a doctorate at Oxford .
2007_03_15_1833179	53	He recalled that his father , a law professor who joined the Egyptian diplomatic corps and spent the early 1970s in France , '' insisted that we be exposed every day to a range of international newspapers that covered the entire political spectrum because it was a constant reminder that there are many ways to think about the same issue . ''
2007_03_15_1833179	54	Though Mr. El-Erian had hoped to become a professor , he was forced to get a job when his father unexpectedly died at the age of 60 , leaving his 23-year-old son to support his mother and a 7-year-old sister .
2007_03_15_1833179	55	He joined the International Monetary Fund in 1983 .
2007_03_15_1833179	56	When he left 15 years later , he was deputy director in the Middle East department , providing emergency aid to governments and advising policy makers . ''
2007_03_15_1833179	57	Then Pimco came along and decided to take a gamble , '' Mr. El-Erian said . ''
2007_03_15_1833179	58	I said that I had never traded a bond in my life and Bill Gross said , ` We can teach you that . ' ''
2007_03_15_1833179	59	When he left , Mr. Gross , the chief investment officer , wrote of Mr. El-Erian in his monthly Investment Outlook note : '' No one could have , or has , done it better since he crossed the threshold from the I.M.F. to Pimco . ''
2007_03_15_1833179	60	Mr. El-Erian turned in a compound 19 percent return for Pimco 's $ 3 billion emerging markets fund over nearly seven years , making it the third-best - performing fund in its sector , according to Morningstar .
2007_03_15_1833179	61	He oversaw an additional $ 25 billion in other managed accounts .
2007_03_15_1833179	62	He was willing to be iconoclastic in his trading .
2007_03_15_1833179	63	In 1999 , convinced that Argentina was running oversize deficits and the economic climate was changing , he sold $ 2 billion of Argentine debt , even though Argentina represented 20 percent of the J. P. Morgan benchmark fund .
2007_03_15_1833179	64	Mr. El-Erian 's assessment proved right two years later when Argentina suffered a $ 100 billion default .
2007_03_15_1833179	65	Though several endowment experts and academics say privately that Mr. El-Erian 's experience may be too narrow , Harvard Management 's board said it believed that his international expertise would give the university an edge . ''
2007_03_15_1833179	66	The investment problem is becoming more and more global , rather than thinking about the classic U.S. asset classes , '' said John Y. Campbell , a Harvard economics professor who is on the management company 's board . ''
2007_03_15_1833179	67	Once you frame the problem that way , it is clearer why Mohamed seemed like an outstanding candidate . ''
2007_03_15_1833179	68	Now Mr. El-Erian wants to apply that international expertise to a broader array of markets .
2007_03_15_1833179	69	Last year , he hired experts in foreign exchange and from the International Monetary Fund to study the stability of various governments overseas . ''
2007_03_15_1833179	70	If you are interested in real estate in Brazil , for example , in addition to the best real estate opportunities , you have to have a view about the neighborhood , '' he said . ''
2007_03_15_1833179	71	There is the question of currency risk , but also the question of whether Brazil is going to stay stable . ''
2007_03_15_1833179	72	At least one of Harvard 's crucial external managers is cutting back the amount of the university 's money it will handle .
2007_03_15_1833179	73	for example , when John Jacobson left Harvard Management to start Highfields Capital Management , a hedge fund that invests in United States equities , Harvard put $ 500 million with him .
2007_03_15_1833179	74	By last year , that figure was $ 2 billion , or 20 percent of Highfields ' capital .
2007_03_15_1833179	75	Without the Meyer relationship and with concerns that no single investor hold such a large stake , Highfields returned $ 1.5 billion to Harvard last year , forcing the endowment to find new managers .
2007_03_15_1833179	76	As Mr. El-Erian works to invest Harvard 's money , he joins a sector of the money management field where some endowment chiefs have become investment stars , working in a fishbowl where the competition , and pressure , are intense .
2007_03_15_1833179	77	How long does he plan to stay ? ''
2007_03_15_1833179	78	I just arrived , '' he responded .
2007_03_15_1833180	0	Just a few years ago , the tax-preparation giant H&R Block was making as much money from offering home loans to individuals with risky credit as it was preparing tax returns for millions of Americans .
2007_03_15_1833180	1	These days , however , while its tax business is showing signs of improvement , H&R Block can not get rid of its subprime mortgage group , Option One , fast enough .
2007_03_15_1833180	2	H&R Block disclosed yesterday that its loss widened to $ 60.3 million in the third quarter as a result of continued problems at Option One .
2007_03_15_1833180	3	The growing losses raised speculation on Wall Street whether executives would achieve their goal of selling the unit for $ 1.3 billion this month . ''
2007_03_15_1833180	4	I think it 's unlikely they 'll get that , having witnessed all of the problems the subprime space has experienced in recent weeks , '' said Kelly Flynn , an analyst with UBS .
2007_03_15_1833180	5	H&R Block is not alone in struggling with mounting losses in the subprime sector , where growing delinquencies and defaults by borrowers are weighing heavily on companies that acquired subprime lenders and reaped robust profits during the boom years in the industry .
2007_03_15_1833180	6	On Tuesday , General Motors said that it would inject $ 1 billion into GMAC because of losses in its mortgage division , Residential Capital .
2007_03_15_1833180	7	Last week , General Electric , which bought the subprime lender WMC Mortgage in 2004 , announced large layoffs in the division along with a significant tightening of lending standards .
2007_03_15_1833180	8	But fears that the problems in subprime could spill over into other real estate and financial markets were tempered somewhat yesterday as Lehman Brothers , a major player in mortgages and their securitization , reported strong first-quarter results .
2007_03_15_1833180	9	And stocks , which had swooned on Tuesday after a report showed further weakness in housing , recovered in afternoon trading yesterday .
2007_03_15_1833180	10	After sell-offs on Asian and European markets , American markets swung back and forth , with the Dow Jones industrial average falling below 12,000 at midday for the first time since early November .
2007_03_15_1833180	11	Stocks ended the day higher .
2007_03_15_1833180	12	The Dow closed up 57.44 points , or 0.48 percent , to 12,133.40 , and the Standard & Poor 's 500 stock index closed up 9.22 points , or 0.67 percent , at 1,387.17 .
2007_03_15_1833180	13	Shares of Countrywide Financial and other lenders that have slumped had gains yesterday .
2007_03_15_1833180	14	Still , shares of Lehman Brothers ended down 28 cents , at $ 71.72 .
2007_03_15_1833180	15	Lehman , which owns five mortgage lenders ( a mix of prime and subprime ) and has had soaring fixed-income revenue in tandem with the housing boom over the years , reported record earnings of $ 1.2 billion for the first quarter , a 5.6 percent rise from a year earlier .
2007_03_15_1833180	16	Lehman 's chief financial officer , Christopher O'Meara , said the bank 's subprime business represented about 3 percent of overall revenue .
2007_03_15_1833180	17	The business has taken a hit with the meltdown of the market . ''
2007_03_15_1833180	18	There 's near-term trepidation as people digest what is happening , '' Mr. O'Meara said . ''
2007_03_15_1833180	19	We think this is temporary . ''
2007_03_15_1833180	20	He noted that securitization volumes had fallen .
2007_03_15_1833180	21	The bank underwrote $ 22 billion in the first quarter , compared with $ 40 billion in the fourth quarter of 2006 and $ 34 billion for the first quarter of 2006 .
2007_03_15_1833180	22	Origination is '' essentially flat '' over the same quarter a year ago , he said .
2007_03_15_1833180	23	Subprime lenders have had more trouble weathering the storm .
2007_03_15_1833180	24	New Century , one of the country 's largest subprime lenders , which stopped making loans last week after Wall Street banks cut off its access to funds , said yesterday that regulators in four states accused the company of violating laws after failing to finance mortgages it promised to borrowers .
2007_03_15_1833180	25	H&R Block appears to be in better straits because its tax business allows it to offset losses .
2007_03_15_1833180	26	H&R Block entered the subprime mortgage industry in 1997 , when it acquired Option One from Fleet Financial .
2007_03_15_1833180	27	( Option One was founded a few years earlier as Plaza Home Mortgage by a handful of executives who departed to start their own company , New Century . )
2007_03_15_1833180	28	Based in Orange County in California , home to many of the nation 's biggest subprime lenders , Option One operated as a fairly separate entity from H&R Block 's core tax-preparation business , analysts said .
2007_03_15_1833180	29	That diversification helped H&R Block as the boom in subprime allowed Option One to buoy profits at a time when the company 's market share in the tax preparation business came under attack by competitors like Jackson Hewitt .
2007_03_15_1833180	30	In fiscal year 2004 , for instance , Option One accounted for $ 688.5 million of H&R 's operating income compared with $ 638.5 million for its tax business that year . ''
2007_03_15_1833180	31	Option One pretty much drove H&R 's shares higher between 2002 and about 2005 , '' said Scott Schneeberger , an analyst with CIBC World Markets . ''
2007_03_15_1833180	32	It really helped the company out . ''
2007_03_15_1833180	33	Last year , however , the subprime unit began producing pain for the parent as losses mounted amid rising interest rates and increased levels of defaults .
2007_03_15_1833180	34	That prompted the company to say it was exploring a sale of Option One in November .
2007_03_15_1833180	35	At that time , several Wall Street firms including Lehman and Merrill Lynch were snapping up subprime lenders .
2007_03_15_1833180	36	A spokesman for the company yesterday declined to comment on expectations for a sale of the unit .
2007_03_15_1833180	37	But the chief executive , Mark Ernst , told Bloomberg News yesterday that he still expected to sell Option One for at least $ 1.3 billion , the unit 's net asset value .
2007_03_15_1833181	0	If you have only one telephone with one phone number , this column wo n't be of any interest to you .
2007_03_15_1833181	1	Skip to another article , you eccentric you .
2007_03_15_1833181	2	But first , count your blessings .
2007_03_15_1833181	3	Millions of people have more than one phone number these days -- home , work , cellular , hotel room , vacation home , yacht -- and with great complexity comes great hassle .
2007_03_15_1833181	4	You have to check multiple answering machines .
2007_03_15_1833181	5	You miss calls when people try to reach you on your cell when you 're at home ( or the other way around ) .
2007_03_15_1833181	6	You send around e-mail messages at work that say , '' On Thursday from 5 to 8:30 , I 'll be on my cell ; for the rest of the weekend , call me at home . ''
2007_03_15_1833181	7	And when you switch your job , cellphone carrier or home city , you have to notify everyone you know that you have new phone numbers .
2007_03_15_1833181	8	A new service called GrandCentral , now in its final weeks of public beta testing , solves all of these problems .
2007_03_15_1833181	9	It 's a rather brilliant melding of cellphone and the Internet .
2007_03_15_1833181	10	Its motto , '' One number for life , '' pretty much says it all .
2007_03_15_1833181	11	At GrandCentral.com , you choose a new , single , unified phone number ( more on this in a moment ) .
2007_03_15_1833181	12	You hand it out to everyone you know , instructing them to delete all your old numbers from their Rolodexes .
2007_03_15_1833181	13	From now on , whenever somebody dials your new uninumber , all of your phones ring simultaneously , like something out of '' The Lawnmower Man . ''
2007_03_15_1833181	14	No longer will anyone have to track you down by dialing each of your numbers in turn .
2007_03_15_1833181	15	No longer does it matter if you 're home , at work or on the road .
2007_03_15_1833181	16	Your new GrandCentral phone number will find you .
2007_03_15_1833181	17	As a bonus , all messages now land in a single voice mail box .
2007_03_15_1833181	18	You can listen to them in any of three ways .
2007_03_15_1833181	19	First , you can dial in from any phone ( a text message arrives on your cellphone to let you know when you have voice mail ) .
2007_03_15_1833181	20	If you call in from your cellphone , you do n't even have to enter your password first .
2007_03_15_1833181	21	You can also play your messages on the Web , at GrandCentral.com , and download them as audio files to preserve for posterity .
2007_03_15_1833181	22	You can even ask to be notified by e-mail ; a link in the e-mail message takes you online to play the voice mail .
2007_03_15_1833181	23	All of this , incredibly , is free if you have only two phone numbers to consolidate .
2007_03_15_1833181	24	A premium plan , at $ 15 a month , offers more of everything : up to six phone numbers unified , voice messages preserved forever instead of for 30 days , and so on , along with a Web site free of ads .
2007_03_15_1833181	25	There are only two substantial downsides to becoming involved with GrandCentral .
2007_03_15_1833181	26	First , GrandCentral offers you a choice of about 20 uninumbers , but it does n't yet offer phone numbers in every area code , so your next-door neighbor may wind up having to dial an out-of-town number to reach you .
2007_03_15_1833181	27	In 14 central states , in fact , GrandCentral offers no numbers at all .
2007_03_15_1833181	28	( You can see what 's available at GrandCentral.com . )
2007_03_15_1833181	29	GrandCentral plans to offer specific vanity phone numbers for an annual fee .
2007_03_15_1833181	30	Second , while you 're publicizing your new number , there will be an awkward period when some people are still dialing your old numbers .
2007_03_15_1833181	31	You 'll have to check all your old voice mail boxes as well as your new GrandCentral one .
2007_03_15_1833181	32	Otherwise , this unification of all your phones and answering machines truly makes life less complicated .
2007_03_15_1833181	33	Be warned , however : GrandCentral offers a huge list of additional features that are n't so simple .
2007_03_15_1833181	34	If you 're not careful , GrandCentral can turn into a full-blown hobby .
2007_03_15_1833181	35	For example : CALLER NAMING -- Every GrandCentral caller is announced by name when you answer the phone .
2007_03_15_1833181	36	( '' Call from Ethel Murgatroid . '' )
2007_03_15_1833181	37	How does it know the name ?
2007_03_15_1833181	38	Sometimes Caller ID supplies it .
2007_03_15_1833181	39	GrandCentral also knows every name in your online address book , which can import your contacts from Yahoo , Gmail or your e-mail program .
2007_03_15_1833181	40	Callers not in these categories are asked to state their names the first time they call .
2007_03_15_1833181	41	On subsequent calls , GrandCentral recognizes them .
2007_03_15_1833181	42	LISTEN IN -- For what may be the first time in cellphone history , you can listen to a message someone is leaving , just as you can on a home answering machine .
2007_03_15_1833181	43	Your phone rings and displays the usual Caller ID information .
2007_03_15_1833181	44	But before you can even say '' Hello , '' GrandCentral 's recording lady tells you the caller 's name , and then offers four ways to handle the call : '' Press 1 to accept , 2 to send to voice mail , 3 to listen in on voice mail , or 4 to accept and record the call . ''
2007_03_15_1833181	45	Your callers have no clue that all this is going on ; they hear only the usual ringing sound .
2007_03_15_1833181	46	If you press 3 , the call goes directly to voice mail -- but you get to listen in .
2007_03_15_1833181	47	If you feel that the caller deserves your immediate attention , you can press * to pick up the call .
2007_03_15_1833181	48	This subtle feature can save you time , cellular minutes and , in certain cases of conflict-avoidance , emotional distress .
2007_03_15_1833181	49	RECORD THE CALL -- Hitting 4 during a call begins recording it ; GrandCentral then treats the recording as a voice mail mesage .
2007_03_15_1833181	50	Here again , you can immortalize the historic calls of your life , or just create a replayable record of driving directions .
2007_03_15_1833181	51	GrandCentral notes that laws in some states require both parties to know that a call is being recorded .
2007_03_15_1833181	52	RINGBACK MUSIC -- This bizarre little feature is evidently popular with young cellphone users in Europe , but is still rare in the United States .
2007_03_15_1833181	53	It lets you replace the ringing sounds the caller hears while waiting for you to answer ( what Lily Tomlin would describe as '' one ringy-dingy , two ringy-dingys '' ) with music -- in GrandCentral 's case , any MP3 file of your choice .
2007_03_15_1833181	54	This does imbue your own personal phone with a certain corporate , Muzakish feel .
2007_03_15_1833181	55	But hey -- who would n't want to seem more European ?
2007_03_15_1833181	56	CUSTOMIZE GREETINGS -- Control freaks , rejoice .
2007_03_15_1833181	57	You can actually record a different voice mail greeting for each person in your address book : '' Hi , sugarcheeks '' for your sweetheart ; '' Ca n't take your call right now , I 'm out looking for a better job '' for your mother .
2007_03_15_1833181	58	You can also specify , on a per person basis , which of your phones ring , which ringback music plays and whether the call goes directly to voice mail .
2007_03_15_1833181	59	Finally , you can tell GrandCentral to answer certain people 's calls with the classic three-tone '' The number you have dialed is no longer in service '' message .
2007_03_15_1833181	60	Telestalkers , bill collectors and ex-lovers come to mind .
2007_03_15_1833181	61	Never has technology been so deliciously evil .
2007_03_15_1833181	62	SWITCH LINES -- Anytime during a call , you can press the * key to make all of your phones ring again , so that you can pick up on a different phone in midconversation , unbeknownst to the person on the other end .
2007_03_15_1833181	63	For example , if you 're heading out the door , you can switch a landline call to your cellphone -- or as you arrive home , a cell call to a landline , in order to save airtime minutes .
2007_03_15_1833181	64	PHONE SPAM FILTERS -- GrandCentral maintains a database of telemarketer numbers that is constantly updated by reports from its own subscribers .
2007_03_15_1833181	65	Your phones do n't even ring when a telemarketer in that database tries to reach you .
2007_03_15_1833181	66	QUICK CHANGES -- With a quick click at GrandCentral.com , you can direct all calls to voice mail when you do n't want to be disturbed ; direct all calls to a new , temporary number ( like a hotel ) ; or prevent your home line from ringing during work hours .
2007_03_15_1833181	67	WEB BUTTONS -- You can install a '' call me '' button on your Web site -- a great , free way to field calls from your eBay , MySpace or dating-service Web page without actually posting your phone number .
2007_03_15_1833181	68	All of this works smoothly and quickly , and the Web site does a noble job of organizing that dizzying number of functions .
2007_03_15_1833181	69	And all of these features are free , even those that would be expensive or unavailable from your phone company .
2007_03_15_1833181	70	Still , you may be forgiven for feeling that GrandCentral 's central idea -- a virtual phone number that 's not associated with a particular telephone -- is too much of a radical brain-slamming change .
2007_03_15_1833181	71	You may also feel that the last thing your life needs is more phone calls reaching you successfully .
2007_03_15_1833181	72	But anyone who spends some time contemplating GrandCentral 's possibilities will soon see the bigger picture : this service removes your location as a consideration in phone calling , much the same way that the TiVo makes a TV show 's broadcast time unimportant .
2007_03_15_1833181	73	In other words , GrandCentral has rewritten the rules in the game of telephone .
2007_03_15_1833181	74	STATE OF THE ART E-mail : Pogue@nytimes.com
2007_03_15_1833182	0	The most widely prescribed sleeping pills can cause strange behavior like driving and eating while asleep , the Food and Drug Administration said yesterday , announcing that strong new warnings will be placed on the labels of 13 drugs .
2007_03_15_1833182	1	The agency also ordered the makers of the well-known drugs Ambien and Lunesta and the producers of 11 other commonly used sleeping pills to create patient fliers explaining how to use them safely .
2007_03_15_1833182	2	The fliers , which the agency says it requires when it sees a significant public health concern , will be handed out at pharmacies when consumers fill their prescriptions .
2007_03_15_1833182	3	Although the agency says that problems with the drugs are rare , reports of the unusual side effects have grown as use of sleeping pills have increased .
2007_03_15_1833182	4	Sales in the United States of Ambien and Lunesta alone last year exceeded $ 3 billion .
2007_03_15_1833182	5	Use of those medications and other similar drugs has soared by more than 60 percent since 2000 , fueled by television , print and other advertising .
2007_03_15_1833182	6	Last year , makers of sleeping pills spent more than $ 600 million on advertising aimed at consumers .
2007_03_15_1833182	7	The review was prompted , in part , by queries to the agency from The New York Times last year , after some users of the most widely prescribed drug , Ambien , started complaining online and to their doctors about unusual reactions ranging from fairly benign sleepwalking episodes to hallucinations , violent outbursts , nocturnal binge eating and -- most troubling of all -- driving while asleep .
2007_03_15_1833182	8	Night eaters said they woke up to find Tostitos and Snickers wrappers in their beds , missing food , kitchen counters overflowing with flour from baking sprees , and even lighted stoves .
2007_03_15_1833182	9	Sleep-drivers reported frightening episodes in which they recalled going to bed , but woke up to find they had been arrested roadside in their underwear or nightclothes .
2007_03_15_1833182	10	The agency said that it was not aware of any deaths caused by sleep-driving .
2007_03_15_1833182	11	The reports gained credence from scientific studies .
2007_03_15_1833182	12	A forensic toxicologist in Wisconsin , Laura J. Liddicoat , gave a presentation at a national meeting on six instances of Ambien-impaired driving .
2007_03_15_1833182	13	And Dr. Carlos H. Schenck and Dr. Mark W. Mahowald of the University of Minnesota said that they had been studying cases of nearly 30 Ambien users who developed unusual nighttime eating disorders .
2007_03_15_1833182	14	Last May in Washington , Rep. Patrick Kennedy , Democrat of Rhode Island , blamed Ambien when he crashed his car near the Capitol building .
2007_03_15_1833182	15	The agency also received reports of people making phone calls , purchasing items over the Internet , or having sex under the influence of sleep medication .
2007_03_15_1833182	16	In each case the consumers had no recollection of the events , which they said had occurred after they took their pills and headed for bed .
2007_03_15_1833182	17	An agency official said yesterday that the activities associated with the drugs went beyond mere sleepwalking . ''
2007_03_15_1833182	18	We do believe that sleepwalking is different from these behaviors , '' said Dr. Russell Katz , the F.D.A. 's director for neurology products . ''
2007_03_15_1833182	19	Sleepwalking is considered more of a reflex .
2007_03_15_1833182	20	These behaviors are complex and they 're different fundamentally because of the complexity .
2007_03_15_1833182	21	People get up , they take their car keys and they go drive .
2007_03_15_1833182	22	As you might imagine , that might be potentially dangerous to the patient and others as well . ''
2007_03_15_1833182	23	Dr. Katz said that it was not entirely clear whether people reporting the problems had been technically asleep or awake .
2007_03_15_1833182	24	Although Dr. Katz said the side effects were rare , the agency said that the few dozen reports it had received probably did not represent the full extent of the problem .
2007_03_15_1833182	25	Drinking alcohol before or after taking the drugs appears to increase the chances of having such a reaction , Dr. Katz said .
2007_03_15_1833182	26	A defense lawyer in Atlanta who specializes in impaired-driving cases , William C. Head , said he had received calls from people around the world who had been charged after using such medications . ''
2007_03_15_1833182	27	Ninety percent of these cases involve alcohol as well , '' Mr. Head said .
2007_03_15_1833182	28	Often , though , the people arrested had only a glass of wine or two , then took a sleeping pill , he said . ''
2007_03_15_1833182	29	You ca n't even keep your car on the road , '' Mr. Head said . ''
2007_03_15_1833182	30	I think any warnings that they give , any advertisements should say not a drop of alcohol . ''
2007_03_15_1833182	31	The medication guides that the agency has called for will clearly explain that risk , according to Dr. Katz , who said the drug makers must submit drafts by May .
2007_03_15_1833182	32	He said the drug makers had been working with the F.D.A. on the wording since the agency notified the companies three months ago that the changes would occur .
2007_03_15_1833182	33	Besides warning against alcohol use , the new labels and guides will tell consumers that they should not take the pills with other drugs that suppress the nervous system .
2007_03_15_1833182	34	The warnings labels will include some general language required by the agency , along with language that the companies will be required to draft that describes the side effects of their specific drugs .
2007_03_15_1833182	35	The drugs affected include newer products as well as older and widely used ones that are sold under brand names and generic names .
2007_03_15_1833182	36	Most of the drugs already carry statements warning against alcohol use and of the risk of hallucinations .
2007_03_15_1833182	37	Advertising for the drugs has also included such warnings .
2007_03_15_1833182	38	But the labels will make those statements more prominent , and the medication inserts will emphasize the risks when the consumer gets the prescription filled .
2007_03_15_1833182	39	The warnings also are to include information about an unrelated and rare risk of life-threatening allergic reactions with sleep medications .
2007_03_15_1833182	40	Some patients have recently reported such reactions , in which the air passages or face swells up , after using one of the newest drugs in the group , Rozerem , Dr. Katz said .
2007_03_15_1833182	41	After reviewing reports , the agency determined that those reactions were also a potential side effect with other drugs in the group , he said .
2007_03_15_1833182	42	Although most of the reports of sleep-driving and sleep-eating have involved Ambien , the agency concluded that the behavior can be caused by any of the sleeping pills .
2007_03_15_1833182	43	One sleep expert , Dr. Mahowald of Minnesota , said that Ambien had received the most publicity because it was the most widely used .
2007_03_15_1833182	44	But '' there 's no question that any of the sedative hypnotics can do this , '' he said .
2007_03_15_1833182	45	Ambien and its extended-release formula , Ambien CR , made by Sanofi-Aventis , dominated the market last year , accounting for 27.6 million of the 44 million sleep drug prescriptions in this country , according to data from Verispan .
2007_03_15_1833182	46	In second place , with about 7.3 million prescriptions , was the drug temazepam , a generic that is also sold by Tyco Healthcare under the brand name Restoril .
2007_03_15_1833182	47	Lunesta , by Sepracor , was next with 5.8 million prescriptions .
2007_03_15_1833182	48	Dr. Mahowald directs the Minnesota Regional Sleep Disorders Center , where doctors have been involved in a study of about 30 patients who developed sleep-eating while using Ambien .
2007_03_15_1833182	49	Some of the patients gained weight before discovering that they were getting up at night to cook and eat . ''
2007_03_15_1833182	50	Hopefully this will make doctors think twice before blindly giving patients a prescription , '' said Dr. Mahowald , who advocates a combination of medication and behavioral therapy to treat insomnia .
2007_03_15_1833182	51	He also criticized marketing of the products . ''
2007_03_15_1833182	52	I personally think the extent of advertising has just been unconscionable , '' he said .
2007_03_15_1833182	53	Data from the research firm TNS Media Intelligence shows that in 2005 and 2006 , Sanofi-Aventis spent a total of nearly $ 350 million to advertise Ambien and Ambien CR .
2007_03_15_1833182	54	Sepracor spent more than $ 500 million on advertising for Lunesta during that same two-year period .
2007_03_15_1833182	55	And Takeda , which makes Rozerem , spent about $ 100 million .
2007_03_15_1833182	56	After yesterday 's F.D.A. announcement , Sanofi-Aventis immediately posted the text of a '' Dear Doctor '' letter to its Web site , outlining the new warnings .
2007_03_15_1833182	57	The agency has ordered all the companies to send such advisories to prescribing doctors .
2007_03_15_1833182	58	In a statement last night , Sanofi-Aventis said that information about sleepwalking had always been included on its label .
2007_03_15_1833182	59	In company clinical studies , it occurred in fewer than 1 in 1,000 patients , the statement said .
2007_03_15_1833182	60	The agency also said that it was recommending that the drug makers conduct additional clinical studies involving sleep-driving and other reactions to determine whether any of the sleeping pills do not cause those problems .
2007_03_15_1833182	61	But those studies will not be required .
2007_03_15_1833182	62	And so far , none of the companies have announced plans to conduct them , Dr. Katz said .
2007_03_15_1833182	63	The agency 's move follows a warning last month by authorities in Australia , where Ambien is marketed as Stilnox .
2007_03_15_1833182	64	The Australian drug agency said that it had received 16 reports of unusual activities by consumers using the product , including sleep-driving and sleep-eating .
2007_03_15_1833182	65	In one case , a woman woke up with a paintbrush in her hand , discovering she had painted the front door of her home while asleep .
2007_03_15_1833184	0	Li Na , who advanced to the semifinals of the Pacific Life Open on Wednesday , remembers the first time she defied her coach in China .
2007_03_15_1833184	1	At one practice when she was 11 , the coach told her , '' You must continue , '' even though Li said she was tired .
2007_03_15_1833184	2	Again , the coach said , '' You must . ''
2007_03_15_1833184	3	Li still said no .
2007_03_15_1833184	4	That strict sports school was no place for insubordination .
2007_03_15_1833184	5	Li was ordered to stand in the same spot during practices until she apologized , which meant staying put for several hours in the morning and several more in the afternoon .
2007_03_15_1833184	6	It took the stubborn Li three days before she said sorry . ''
2007_03_15_1833184	7	For a long time after that , if the boss said , ` Go , ' I went because that 's what people do in China , '' Li said after beating Russia 's Vera Zvonareva , 6-4 , 7-5 . ''
2007_03_15_1833184	8	Now , I 'm different .
2007_03_15_1833184	9	If the boss say , ` Go , ' I do n't go .
2007_03_15_1833184	10	I do n't care what they say . ''
2007_03_15_1833184	11	Li , 25 , is ranked No. 17 in the world and No. 1 in China .
2007_03_15_1833184	12	She has been a trailblazer for Chinese tennis : the first to win a WTA Tour event ; the first to break into the top 30 in the rankings ; the first to advance to the quarterfinals in a Grand Slam event .
2007_03_15_1833184	13	She reached a career-high No. 16 last year after advancing to the quarterfinals at Wimbledon .
2007_03_15_1833184	14	This year , at the Australian Open , she lost in the quarterfinals to Martina Hingis .
2007_03_15_1833184	15	Mary Joe Fernandez , a two-time Olympic gold medalist and an analyst for ESPN , said Li had the talent to break into the top 10 , calling her a powerful player with one of the best two-handed backhands in the game .
2007_03_15_1833184	16	She said Li just needed more experience . ''
2007_03_15_1833184	17	I 'm not surprised she 's improving so fast , either , '' Fernandez said , '' because China is really pushing to have athletes ready for the Olympics . ''
2007_03_15_1833184	18	Li 's ability has given her personal freedom in a country that frowns on individuality .
2007_03_15_1833184	19	She is not forced to travel or eat with her compatriots on the WTA Tour .
2007_03_15_1833184	20	She has her own coach , who is also her husband , and a personal fitness coach .
2007_03_15_1833184	21	If she practices with the national team , she said , she feigns an injury if she wants to take a break .
2007_03_15_1833184	22	Li , quick-witted and spunky , has figured out how to bend the rules . ''
2007_03_15_1833184	23	Because I have potential in tennis , they let me do certain things , '' she said .
2007_03_15_1833184	24	Li is proud of her rebellious streak .
2007_03_15_1833184	25	She has multiple piercings on each ear , which she said angered her federation and national coaches . ''
2007_03_15_1833184	26	When I do n't play well , they say , ` See , it 's because of the earrings ! ' ''
2007_03_15_1833184	27	she said , giggling as her silver dangly earrings swished .
2007_03_15_1833184	28	Li said she loved tennis because it had allowed her to see the world , an opportunity unavailable to most of her countrymen .
2007_03_15_1833184	29	But there was a time she thought differently .
2007_03_15_1833184	30	Having played since she was 8 , she grew sick of the sport by the time she was 20 , quitting to enroll in a university .
2007_03_15_1833184	31	Two years later , she was coaxed back to her city team .
2007_03_15_1833184	32	Soon , she returned to the national team .
2007_03_15_1833184	33	That same year , 2004 , she won her first WTA Tour event . ''
2007_03_15_1833184	34	She has been a great player since then , '' Zvonareva said Wednesday . ''
2007_03_15_1833184	35	Now I think the younger generation of Chinese players look up to her as a hero .
2007_03_15_1833184	36	All of tennis in China will get better because she gives them a reason to believe in themselves . ''
2007_03_15_1833184	37	Although Li is China 's best hope for a singles medal at the Beijing Olympics next year , she still must deal with criticism from her tennis federation , to which she gives a percentage of her winnings .
2007_03_15_1833184	38	Officials have disapproved of what they call her hot temper , her hardheadedness and her love of shopping , which they say ruins her focus .
2007_03_15_1833184	39	( In a publicized shopping spree in Dubai last year , Li spent $ 3,000 on clothing and makeup . )
2007_03_15_1833184	40	Last month , the China Tennis Association chief , Sun Jinfang , said that Li 's '' weak mentality hampers her improvement . ''
2007_03_15_1833184	41	Sun has also called Chinese players '' chokers . ''
2007_03_15_1833184	42	Still , Li showed incredible focus when she rebounded from a 5-1 deficit in the second set to beat Zvonareva .
2007_03_15_1833184	43	She saved three set points , not shaken by the heat or by Zvonareva , who the day before toppled the world 's No. 1 , Maria Sharapova .
2007_03_15_1833184	44	But even if she had not won , Li said , there would have been an upside : shopping in nearby Palm Springs . ''
2007_03_15_1833184	45	Before , I was told that shopping made my tennis bad , '' she said . ''
2007_03_15_1833184	46	But now the coach says you just play tennis and stay happy .
2007_03_15_1833184	47	They say , ` If you want to go shopping , maybe you 'd feel better and play better . '
2007_03_15_1833184	48	I think so , too . ''
2007_03_15_1833185	0	It was just a regular-season game , the rivals tried to say with a shrug but a perceptible glint in their eyes .
2007_03_15_1833185	1	This was n't the playoffs ?
2007_03_15_1833185	2	Tell that to Steve Nash and Dirk Nowitzki , who exchanged daggers as if they were deciding the M.V.P. award Wednesday night .
2007_03_15_1833185	3	This was n't the postseason ?
2007_03_15_1833185	4	Tell that to the sellout crowd of 20,525 inside American Airlines Center where March was alive with May Madness in a delirious double-overtime game that was anything but regular .
2007_03_15_1833185	5	In the end of the exhaustive double overtime , Nowitzki 's fade-away jumper clanked off the amplified rim with two-tenths of a second left , allowing the Suns to escape with a 129-127 victory .
2007_03_15_1833185	6	Nash , the two-time reigning M.V.P. finished with 32 points , 16 assists and 8 rebounds to lead Phoenix , snapping the Mavericks ' 23-game home winning streak .
2007_03_15_1833185	7	Nowitzki finished with 30 points and 16 rebounds , his feat in bringing the Mavericks back from a 16-point first-half deficit into a 15-point lead to start the fourth quarter ringing hollow .
2007_03_15_1833185	8	The Suns ( 50-14 ) drew within two and a half games of the Western Conference-leading Mavericks ( 52-11 ) .
2007_03_15_1833185	9	The Mavericks had not lost two games in a row since dropping the first four games of the season .
2007_03_15_1833185	10	But their motto since losing to the Miami Heat in the finals has been : '' It 's not how you start , but how you finish . ''
2007_03_15_1833185	11	The Mavericks started as poorly as they did Monday in a dreadful 117-100 loss to the Golden State Warriors .
2007_03_15_1833185	12	The Suns , much like the Warriors , had their way in the paint .
2007_03_15_1833185	13	The Mavericks were flat-footed on the Suns ' screen and roll , with Nowitzki often finding himself mismatched , on Nash , who capitalized .
2007_03_15_1833185	14	Falling behind , 32-18 , in the first quarter -- a deficit that would grow to 16 in the second -- the Mavericks tightened their defense and outscored the Suns by 73-44 in the second and third quarters .
2007_03_15_1833185	15	A Dallas victory seemed almost certain -- until Nash brought the Suns back from the brink in the fourth quarter and erased a 5-point deficit with just under a minute to play .
2007_03_15_1833185	16	It was his rainbow 3-pointer ( following his own miss ) with 2.7 seconds left in regulation that forced the game 's first overtime .
2007_03_15_1833185	17	Jason Terry hit a 3-pointer with 4.9 seconds left to tie the score at 120-120 to force the second overtime .
2007_03_15_1833185	18	Nash was the link to the past , the present and what might have been for the Suns and Mavericks had the Dallas owner Mark Cuban offered him more money to stay in town as a free agent in 2004 .
2007_03_15_1833185	19	Both teams have benefited from the Suns wooing Nash as a free agent .
2007_03_15_1833185	20	Still , it was tempting for Nash to think '' what if ? ''
2007_03_15_1833185	21	he and Nowitzki had been able to remain teammates . ''
2007_03_15_1833185	22	If I sit down and think about it , I feel a little bit of regret in that we could have won a championship if we were left together but at the same time that was out of my hands , '' Nash said of Nowitzki . ''
2007_03_15_1833185	23	I do n't really think about it , daily or moment to moment because I 've had so much fun in Phoenix and we 've had so much success , '' Nash continued . ''
2007_03_15_1833185	24	We took a franchise that was struggling and now we 're one of the top teams so we 've got a lot to be proud of that .
2007_03_15_1833185	25	That really negates a lot of regret or ill-will that would be there . ''
2007_03_15_1833185	26	All he wanted to do was boost his friend , Nowitzki , for the M.V.P. award . ''
2007_03_15_1833185	27	They 're having a season that I do n't think anyone has had in quite a long time , '' Nash said of the Mavericks , adding of Nowitzki : '' He 's having a great season individually and the two add up to him deserving the award . ''
2007_03_15_1833185	28	Both the Suns and Mavericks began the season 1-4 .
2007_03_15_1833185	29	Since then , they each have rattled off 17-game winning streaks .
2007_03_15_1833185	30	But for as impressive as Dallas has been this season , the Suns are not exactly shrinking in the Mavericks ' shadow . ''
2007_03_15_1833185	31	We know over the last two years we can beat this team , '' Phoenix Coach Mike D'Antoni said before the game .
2007_03_15_1833185	32	The Suns lost both games this season , but had won four of their last six regular season games against the Mavericks .
2007_03_15_1833185	33	The Suns beat the Mavericks in the Western Conference semifinals in 2004-5 , and Dallas returned the favor in the conference finals last season .
2007_03_15_1833185	34	The Mavericks have 19 games remaining more games and would have to go 18-1 to reach 70 victories , a threshold a team no team has crossed since the 72-10 Bulls in 1995-1996 .
2007_03_15_1833185	35	PRO BASKETBALL Correction : March 16 , 2007 , Friday A sports headline in some copies yesterday about the Phoenix Suns ' 129-127 victory in double overtime against the Dallas Mavericks misstated the game 's outcome .
2007_03_15_1833185	36	Steve Nash and the Suns '' outdueled '' Dirk Nowitzki and the Mavericks , not the other way around .
2007_03_15_1833186	0	An Ohio representative is planning to release information today that suggests Wal-Mart 's ambitions into consumer banking may extend beyond what the retail giant had previously disclosed .
2007_03_15_1833186	1	The information , in the form of an e-mail message sent by a Wal-Mart employee , suggested that the company was laying the groundwork to offer its own banking products .
2007_03_15_1833186	2	Wal-Mart has long insisted that it was not interested in branch banking but was looking to use the bank as a way to save money .
2007_03_15_1833186	3	But Representative Paul E. Gillmor , an Ohio Republican , said last night that he was concerned that the undated e-mail message suggested that Wal-Mart was telling its tenants , some which are retail banks , that it was reserving the right to become a full-service bank , including the underwriting of mortgages .
2007_03_15_1833186	4	A Wal-Mart spokeswoman confirmed last night that the company had updated some of its tenant leases late last year to include the language in question but implied that it had been an option all along . ''
2007_03_15_1833186	5	There is nothing new here , '' the spokeswoman , Mona Williams , said . ''
2007_03_15_1833186	6	While we recently updated language in our leases , similar language has been in our agreements for at least five years . ''
2007_03_15_1833186	7	The new information comes as the House Financial Services Committee gears up for hearings next week on a closely watched law that would bar non-financial institutions , like Wal-Mart Stores and Home Depot , from operating a bank .
2007_03_15_1833186	8	Wal-Mart submitted an application in 2005 with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation for an industrial bank in Utah that it said would be used to process its own credit and debit card transactions for its 3,500 United States stores .
2007_03_15_1833186	9	The application almost immediately ignited opposition from lawmakers , consumer groups and financial companies who worried that the company would use its reach to become a retail banking powerhouse .
2007_03_15_1833186	10	The legislation , and next week 's hearing , are fallout from the application .
2007_03_15_1833186	11	In an interview last night , Mr. Gillmor said the Wal-Mart was including a clause in some tenant leases that would allow the company to some day expand its banking operations .
2007_03_15_1833186	12	Wal-Mart currently offers branded credit cards , check cashing and other services through partnerships with financials institutions . ''
2007_03_15_1833186	13	We simply became more specific late last year , '' Ms. Williams said , referring to the additional term related to the mortgages .
2007_03_15_1833186	14	But Mr. Gillmor , who is co-sponsoring legislation that would prevent Wal-Mart and other non-financial institutions from expanding into retail banking , disagreed . ''
2007_03_15_1833186	15	If they were not going to go into full-service banking , why in the world would they do that ?
2007_03_15_1833186	16	There is no other reason , '' he said . ''
2007_03_15_1833186	17	They want to be prepared in case they get their way . ''
2007_03_15_1833186	18	Mr. Gillmor would not say who provided him the e-mail document , but a person briefed on the situation said that it came from a banking industry group and was probably three or four weeks old .
2007_03_15_1833186	19	The e-mail message comes as Congressional lawmakers engage in the latest round of debate over whether non-financial companies , like Wal-Mart and Home Depot , should be allowed to buy or charter so-called industrial loan companies that are operated like banks .
2007_03_15_1833186	20	Along with Representative Barney Frank , the Massachusetts Democrat who is chairman of the House Financial Services Committee , Mr. Gillmor recently introduced the legislation that would prevent such companies from starting an industrial bank and restrict some existing ones from expanding .
2007_03_15_1833186	21	Mr. Gillmor said yesterday that he believed he had enough votes to pass the bill in the House and that there was a '' very reasonable '' chance of winning Senate approval .
2007_03_15_1833186	22	Wal-Mart 's application for an industrial loan company charter has been a hot-button political issue with banking industry groups aligning themselves with regulators and some of the company 's fiercest critics .
2007_03_15_1833186	23	The Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said in a speech earlier this month that if Congress was interested in keeping banking and commerce separate , '' it should take note of this problem . ''
2007_03_15_1833186	24	The F.D.I.C. said last month that it would extend a one-year moratorium on new applications for the industrial bank charters to allow lawmakers more time to weigh in on the issue .
2007_03_15_1833186	25	It first imposed a temporary ban in July .
2007_03_15_1833186	26	Besides Wal-Mart , Home Depot , DaimlerChrysler and Cargill have applications pending .
2007_03_15_1833186	27	Industrial banks have been around for about a century , initially appearing as small , state-charted banks that offered loans to low-income workers who were turned away by traditional banks .
2007_03_15_1833186	28	Their special status allowed them to remain exempt from laws barring commercial companies from owning banks .
2007_03_15_1833186	29	Even though only a handful of states offer charters , their growth has exploded .
2007_03_15_1833186	30	Today , they are a $ 177 billion industry , with about 60 companies from General Motors and General Electric to Target and Merrill Lynch operating industrial banks .
2007_03_15_1833188	0	On a frigid Monday night late last month , long after the daytime students had departed , Jose A. Castro , a vice principal at Automotive High School in Brooklyn , stood before two rows of desks parked next to several cars in a second-floor classroom .
2007_03_15_1833188	1	Before him sat a diverse and unlikely group of adult recruits that he hopes will help replenish the shrinking ranks of qualified mechanics in New York City .
2007_03_15_1833188	2	Sprinkled among the burly men were a few women with well-tended fingernails , all dressed in navy blue coveralls .
2007_03_15_1833188	3	Some in the class were out of work , some had government jobs .
2007_03_15_1833188	4	At least one had served time in prison .
2007_03_15_1833188	5	Several did not even have licenses to drive .
2007_03_15_1833188	6	But all of them had come to the school with the hope that it was not too late for them to shift into better-paying jobs in the automotive trade .
2007_03_15_1833188	7	The rapid computerization of car engines has forced many veteran mechanics to choose early retirement rather than learn new technologies .
2007_03_15_1833188	8	That trend has created more openings than employers have been able to fill .
2007_03_15_1833188	9	In the five years through 2005 , the number of people working in car repair in the city declined by about 6 percent to fewer than 10,000 , according to the Manhattan office of the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics . ''
2007_03_15_1833188	10	I just want to show the men what I 've got , '' said DeShonia L. Holman , 24 , a soft-spoken student in Mr. Castro 's class whose day job is maintaining a tennis club on Roosevelt Island . ''
2007_03_15_1833188	11	I think it 's sexy for a woman to know how to fix a car . ''
2007_03_15_1833188	12	Motivations are of little concern to Mr. Castro and the union leaders who organized the free course , which meets two nights a week .
2007_03_15_1833188	13	They are willing to take anyone who wants to be trained for garage work .
2007_03_15_1833188	14	Mr. Castro is only 40 , but he sounded like a graybeard harking back to the days when tuning up car engines was desirable work .
2007_03_15_1833188	15	Now those stable high-paying jobs are going unfilled all around the city because garage work , although cleaner than it once was , is less socially acceptable , he said . ''
2007_03_15_1833188	16	We believe that some of our kids can make this a great living , '' he said .
2007_03_15_1833188	17	But , he added , '' some people think it 's not pretty enough for their children . ''
2007_03_15_1833188	18	After decades of declining emphasis on vocational education in the city , Automotive High , which turned out just 52 graduates last year , is on track to double that number this year , said Melissa Silberman , the school 's principal .
2007_03_15_1833188	19	She said only about one-fourth of last year 's graduates went directly into the auto industry , while most of the rest went on to automotive schools or colleges .
2007_03_15_1833188	20	Statistics show that the need for mechanics is not just a local problem .
2007_03_15_1833188	21	The federal Labor Department estimated that more than 400,000 mechanics jobs would become available nationwide , through retirements and new openings , between 2004 and 2014 .
2007_03_15_1833188	22	But Norman Brown , legislative director of the New York State Council of Machinists in Brooklyn , said , '' I do think the shortage of mechanics is more acute in the New York City area . ''
2007_03_15_1833188	23	And the shortage exists despite the availability of entry-level positions that pay at least $ 17 an hour , according to union officials .
2007_03_15_1833188	24	With years of training and experience , a skilled mechanic or technician can earn $ 100,000 or more annually , they said .
2007_03_15_1833188	25	Getting more recruits into the classroom is a considerable challenge because of the stigma attached to the job , said Fred Bordoff , owner of the New York Center for Automotive Technology , an independent repair shop in Sunnyside , Queens . ''
2007_03_15_1833188	26	It 's not something that people aspire to get into , '' Mr. Bordoff said . ''
2007_03_15_1833188	27	If a kid goes home and says , ' I want to be a mechanic , ' his parents will probably have a heart attack .
2007_03_15_1833188	28	It 's always been and still is , ` My son an auto mechanic ? '
2007_03_15_1833188	29	They 're too embarrassed to say that . ''
2007_03_15_1833188	30	Another reason for the labor shortage , Mr. Brown said , is that the tradition of apprenticeships has faded , along with the city 's manufacturing base . ''
2007_03_15_1833188	31	With the deindustrialization of America , there is not really a pool of workers like there was , '' Mr. Brown said . ''
2007_03_15_1833188	32	In '72 or ' 69 , a trained mechanic could walk into any factory and get a job . ''
2007_03_15_1833188	33	An added factor , he said , is that many job applicants can not clear the minimum hurdles of passing a drug test and maintaining a clean driver 's license or a commercial driver 's license if they want to work as a truck or bus mechanic .
2007_03_15_1833188	34	To meet the needs of unionized repair shops , the Consortium for Worker Education , a union-financed initiative , arranged to pay for the training course at Automotive High as a pilot program .
2007_03_15_1833188	35	The consortium , whose partners include unions of machinists , auto workers and Teamsters , is planning additional courses in other places , like Mr. Bordoff 's garage .
2007_03_15_1833188	36	It rounded up recruits from various placement agencies .
2007_03_15_1833188	37	Some of the women received referrals from Nontraditional Employment for Women , which trains women for jobs in construction and repair .
2007_03_15_1833188	38	Roger Jackson , who said he had spent almost all of his adult life in a Virginia prison after getting involved in the selling of illegal drugs , heard about the course from a brother who works in the service department of a local Toyota dealership .
2007_03_15_1833188	39	He said he was eager to learn a trade that would lead to a legitimate job with health benefits , enabling him , at 34 , to start contributing to the Social Security system . ''
2007_03_15_1833188	40	Right now I need some type of marketable skill so I do n't feel like I 'm a liability , I 'm more of an asset , '' Mr. Jackson said .
2007_03_15_1833188	41	Whenever Mr. Castro posed a question , Mr. Jackson 's thick left arm shot up first . ''
2007_03_15_1833188	42	I 'm learning so much , I 'm like a sponge in that class , '' Mr. Jackson said yesterday .
2007_03_15_1833188	43	One floor up from where Mr. Castro was giving half the students a primer on measuring brake pads for wear , Manuel Martinez , another instructor , had a dozen men huddled around the raised hood of a red Ford Escort .
2007_03_15_1833188	44	He quizzed them on how often the oil should be changed , then lifted a fuel filter and explained its purpose in simple terms .
2007_03_15_1833188	45	Kenneth Street , a tall , broad-shouldered resident of East New York , stood back and nodded knowingly .
2007_03_15_1833188	46	By all appearances , Mr. Street , 34 , was in his element .
2007_03_15_1833188	47	He said tinkering with cars was what he loved to do and he radiated pride as he described the Mustang Cobra he had modified to race at a local track .
2007_03_15_1833188	48	But , asked how he made his living , he sheepishly admitted that lately he had been helping his mother run two day care centers . ''
2007_03_15_1833188	49	Everybody 's always telling me I should try mechanics , '' Mr. Street said , especially the certified mechanics he knows .
2007_03_15_1833188	50	In New York State , there are no licensing requirements to work as a mechanic , Mr. Bordoff said .
2007_03_15_1833188	51	But most dealerships require mechanics to complete training and earn certifications before they can perform any of the more technical repairs on an engine , he said .
2007_03_15_1833188	52	Mr. Street said his goal was to land a job with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority as a bus mechanic .
2007_03_15_1833188	53	He said he understood that the starting pay at the transit agency would be about $ 24 or $ 25 an hour . ''
2007_03_15_1833188	54	I 'd take that any day , '' Mr. Street said .
2007_03_15_1833188	55	Although the pay is relatively attractive , it is still too low for some to a support a family on , said Mr. Brown , who is a nonvoting member of the transportation authority 's board . ''
2007_03_15_1833188	56	I 've got guys that fix trucks in south Brooklyn that make $ 25 , $ 26 an hour -- a good wage , '' he said . ''
2007_03_15_1833188	57	But they ca n't live anywhere near where they work . ''
2007_03_15_1833188	58	Mr. Brown said that of the 1,400 union members he represents , only one or two women were '' on the tools . ''
2007_03_15_1833188	59	But that may be changing .
2007_03_15_1833188	60	He said he was encouraged to see young women like Ms. Holman showing an interest in garage work .
2007_03_15_1833188	61	Solidly built with a shy smile , Ms. Holman said she was not intimidated by jobs traditionally considered man 's work .
2007_03_15_1833188	62	Lately , she said , she had also been considering trying her hand as an electrician . ''
2007_03_15_1833188	63	There 's a lot of jobs that pay better , '' she said , but added , '' This is something I like doing . ''
2007_03_15_1833188	64	Then she circled past the four-wheel guinea pigs in the automotive laboratory and returned to her desk to catch up with Mr. Castro , who had moved on from measuring with micrometers to checking an electrical circuit .
2007_03_15_1833188	65	It was after 8 p.m. , but Mr. Castro knew that his charges still had a lot to learn .
2007_03_15_1833190	0	Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton foresees a '' remaining military as well as political mission '' in Iraq , and says that if elected president , she would keep a reduced military force there to fight Al Qaeda , deter Iranian aggression , protect the Kurds and possibly support the Iraqi military .
2007_03_15_1833190	1	In a half-hour interview on Tuesday in her Senate office , Mrs. Clinton said the scaled-down American military force that she would maintain would stay off the streets in Baghdad and would no longer try to protect Iraqis from sectarian violence -- even if it descended into ethnic cleansing .
2007_03_15_1833190	2	In outlining how she would handle Iraq as commander in chief , Mrs. Clinton articulated a more nuanced position than the one she has provided at her campaign events , where she has backed the goal of '' bringing the troops home . ''
2007_03_15_1833190	3	She said in the interview that there were '' remaining vital national security interests in Iraq '' that would require a continuing deployment of American troops .
2007_03_15_1833190	4	The United States ' security would be undermined if parts of Iraq turned into a failed state '' that serves as a petri dish for insurgents and Al Qaeda , '' she said . ''
2007_03_15_1833190	5	It is right in the heart of the oil region , '' she said . ''
2007_03_15_1833190	6	It is directly in opposition to our interests , to the interests of regimes , to Israel 's interests . ''
2007_03_15_1833190	7	[ Excerpts , Page A14 . ] ''
2007_03_15_1833190	8	So it will be up to me to try to figure out how to protect those national security interests and continue to take our troops out of this urban warfare , which I think is a loser , '' Mrs. Clinton added .
2007_03_15_1833190	9	She declined to estimate the number of American troops she would keep in Iraq , saying she would draw on the advice of military officers .
2007_03_15_1833190	10	Mrs. Clinton 's plans carry some political risk .
2007_03_15_1833190	11	Although she has been extremely critical of the Bush administration 's handling of the war , some liberal Democrats are deeply suspicious of her intentions on Iraq , given that she voted in 2002 to authorize the use of force there and , unlike some of her rivals for the Democratic nomination , has not apologized for having done so .
2007_03_15_1833190	12	Senator Clinton 's proposal is also likely to stir up debate among military specialists .
2007_03_15_1833190	13	Some counterinsurgency experts say the plan is unrealistic because Iraqis are unlikely to provide useful tips about Al Qaeda if American troops end their efforts to protect Iraqi neighborhoods .
2007_03_15_1833190	14	But a former Pentagon official argued that such an approach would minimize American casualties and thus make it easier politically to sustain a long-term military presence that might prevent the fighting from spreading throughout the region .
2007_03_15_1833190	15	Mrs. Clinton has said she would vote for a proposed Democratic resolution on Iraq now being debated on the floor of the Senate , which sets a goal of withdrawing combat forces by March 31 , 2008 .
2007_03_15_1833190	16	Asked if her plan was consistent with the resolution , Mrs. Clinton and her advisers said it was , noting that the resolution also called for '' a limited number '' of troops to stay in Iraq to protect the American Embassy and other personnel , train and equip Iraqi forces , and conduct '' targeted counterterrorism operations . ''
2007_03_15_1833190	17	( Senator Barack Obama , a rival of Mrs. Clinton , has said that if elected president , he might keep a small number of troops in Iraq . )
2007_03_15_1833190	18	With many Democratic primary voters favoring a total withdrawal , Senator Clinton appears to be trying to balance her political interests with the need to retain some flexibility .
2007_03_15_1833190	19	Like other Democratic candidates , she has called for engaging Iran and Syria in talks and called on President Bush to reverse his troop buildup .
2007_03_15_1833190	20	But while Mrs. Clinton has criticized Mr. Bush 's troop reinforcements as an escalation of war , she said in the interview , '' We 're doing it , and it 's unlikely we can stop it . '' ''
2007_03_15_1833190	21	I 'm going to root for it if it has any chance of success , '' she said of Mr. Bush 's plan , '' but I think it 's more likely that the anti-American violence and sectarian violence just moves from place to place to place , like the old Whac a Mole .
2007_03_15_1833190	22	Clear some neighborhoods in Baghdad , then face Ramadi .
2007_03_15_1833190	23	Clear Ramadi , then maybe it 's back in Falluja . ''
2007_03_15_1833190	24	Mrs. Clinton made it clear that she believed the next president is likely to face an Iraq that is still plagued by sectarian fighting and occupied by a sizable number of American troops .
2007_03_15_1833190	25	The likely problems , she said , include continued political disagreements in Baghdad , die-hard Sunni insurgents , Al Qaeda operatives , Turkish anxiety over the Kurds and the effort to '' prevent Iran from crossing the border and having too much influence inside of Iraq . '' ''
2007_03_15_1833190	26	The choices that one would face are neither good nor unlimited , '' she said . ''
2007_03_15_1833190	27	And from the vantage point of where I sit now , I can tell you , in the absence of a very vigorous diplomatic effort on the political front and on the regional and international front , I think it is unlikely there will be a stable situation that will be inherited . ''
2007_03_15_1833190	28	On the campaign trail , Mrs. Clinton has repeatedly vowed to bring the war to a close if the fighting were still going on when she took office as president . ''
2007_03_15_1833190	29	If we in Congress do n't end this war before January 2009 , as president , I will , '' she has said .
2007_03_15_1833190	30	In the interview , she suggested that it was likely that the fighting among the Iraqis would continue for some time .
2007_03_15_1833190	31	In broad terms , her strategy is to abandon the American military effort to stop the sectarian violence and to focus instead on trying to prevent the strife from spreading throughout the region by shrinking and rearranging American troop deployments within Iraq .
2007_03_15_1833190	32	The idea of repositioning American forces to minimize American casualties , discourage Iranian , Syrian and Turkish intervention , and forestall the Kurds ' declaring independence is not a new one .
2007_03_15_1833190	33	It has been advocated by Dov S. Zakheim , who served as the Pentagon 's comptroller under former Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld .
2007_03_15_1833190	34	Mr. Zakheim has estimated that no more than 75,000 troops would be required , compared to the approximately 160,000 troops the United States will have in Iraq when the additional brigades in Mr. Bush 's plan are deployed .
2007_03_15_1833190	35	While Mrs. Clinton declined to estimate the size of a residual American troop presence , she indicated that troops might be based north of Baghdad and in western Anbar Province . ''
2007_03_15_1833190	36	It would be far fewer troops , '' she said . ''
2007_03_15_1833190	37	But what we can do is to almost take a line sort of north of -- between Baghdad and Kirkuk , and basically put our troops into that region , the ones that are going to remain for our antiterrorism mission , for our northern support mission , for our ability to respond to the Iranians , and to continue to provide support , if called for , for the Iraqis . ''
2007_03_15_1833190	38	Mrs. Clinton described a mission with serious constraints . ''
2007_03_15_1833190	39	We would not be doing patrols , '' she added . ''
2007_03_15_1833190	40	We would not be kicking in doors .
2007_03_15_1833190	41	We would not be trying to insert ourselves in the middle between the various Shiite and Sunni factions .
2007_03_15_1833190	42	I do not think that 's a smart or achievable mission for American forces . ''
2007_03_15_1833190	43	One question raised by counterinsurgency experts is whether the more limited military mission Mrs. Clinton is advocating would lead to a further escalation in the sectarian fighting , because it would shift the entire burden for protecting civilians to the nascent Iraqi Security Forces .
2007_03_15_1833190	44	A National Intelligence Estimate issued in January said those forces would be hard-pressed to take on significantly increased responsibilities in the next 12 to 18 months . ''
2007_03_15_1833190	45	Coalition capabilities , including force levels , resources and operations , remain an essential stabilizing element in Iraq , '' the estimate noted , referring to the American-led forces .
2007_03_15_1833190	46	Mrs. Clinton said the intelligence estimate was based on a '' faulty premise '' because it did not take into account the sort of '' phased redeployment '' plan she was advocating .
2007_03_15_1833190	47	But she acknowledged that under her strategy American troops would remain virtual bystanders if Shiites and Sunnis killed each other in sectarian attacks . ''
2007_03_15_1833190	48	That may be inevitable , '' she said . ''
2007_03_15_1833190	49	And it certainly may be the only way to concentrate the attention of the parties . ''
2007_03_15_1833190	50	Asked if Americans would endure having troops in Iraq who do nothing to stop sectarian attacks there , she replied : '' Look , I think the American people are done with Iraq .
2007_03_15_1833190	51	I think they are at a point where , whether they thought it was a good idea or not , they have seen misjudgment and blunder after blunder , and their attitude is , What is this getting us ?
2007_03_15_1833190	52	What is this doing for us ? '' ''
2007_03_15_1833190	53	No one wants to sit by and see mass killing , '' she added . ''
2007_03_15_1833190	54	It 's going on every day !
2007_03_15_1833190	55	Thousands of people are dying every month in Iraq .
2007_03_15_1833190	56	Our presence there is not stopping it .
2007_03_15_1833190	57	And there is no potential opportunity I can imagine where it could .
2007_03_15_1833190	58	This is an Iraqi problem ; we can not save the Iraqis from themselves .
2007_03_15_1833190	59	If we had a different attitude going in there , if we had stopped the looting immediately , if we had asserted our authority -- you can go down the lines , if , if , if -- '' If Elected ... This is the first in a series of interviews with the 2008 presidential candidates in both parties about how they would handle the issues they would confront as president .
2007_03_15_1833190	60	Future articles will look at the positions of the other candidates on Iraq and on other national security and domestic policy matters .
2007_03_15_1833191	0	The Bush administration , which six months ago issued a series of political goals for the Iraqi government to meet by this month , is now tacitly acknowledging that the goals will take significantly longer to achieve .
2007_03_15_1833191	1	In interviews this week , administration officials said that the military buildup intended to stabilize Baghdad and create the conditions for achieving the objectives would not be fully in place until June and that all of the objectives would not be fulfilled until the year 's end .
2007_03_15_1833191	2	A '' notional political timeline '' that the administration provided to Congress in January in an attachment to a letter from Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to Senator Carl Levin , chairman of the Armed Services Committee , had called for most of the objectives to be met by this month .
2007_03_15_1833191	3	Four of the significant objectives are final approval of an oil law regulating distribution of oil revenues and foreign investment in the oil industry ; reversal of the de-Baathification laws that are widely blamed for alienating Sunnis by driving them out of government ministries ; the holding of local elections ; and reform of Iraq 's Constitution .
2007_03_15_1833191	4	A Pentagon assessment of progress in Iraq through the end of last year , submitted to Congress on Wednesday , notes that Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki '' has promised to reform his government , beginning with his cabinet and the ministries , '' but that none of those steps had yet happened .
2007_03_15_1833191	5	It cited the '' passage of a framework '' last month for sharing oil revenues among Iraq 's ethnic groups as a modest sign of progress , but notes that the last two months of 2006 , before Mr. Bush announced his new strategy , '' saw little progress on the reconciliation front . ''
2007_03_15_1833191	6	The report also described some of what is happening in Iraq as a '' civil war '' and described this past October through December as the most violent three-month period since 2003 .
2007_03_15_1833191	7	In interviews , officials said they expected most political progress to be months away .
2007_03_15_1833191	8	The slower pace of progress puts the administration in a difficult position , at a time of growing Congressional criticism of the new strategy , which starts with an increase of more than 20,000 American troops .
2007_03_15_1833191	9	The slowness of political progress , officials say , could indicate the need to extend the time the new troops remain on the ground in Baghdad and its suburbs .
2007_03_15_1833191	10	Congressional Democrats are seeking passage of legislation that would impose a 2008 deadline for withdrawal of American troops , and they are calling for evidence that political benchmarks are being met .
2007_03_15_1833191	11	Mr. Bush has told Congressional leaders that such American demands are part of '' a culture of seeking instant results , '' officials who have met with him said .
2007_03_15_1833191	12	Still , a House bill under consideration this week lists benchmarks for Iraqi political progress and would require Mr. Bush to certify by July 1 that progress was being made .
2007_03_15_1833191	13	The bill would basically give Mr. Bush and the Iraqi government a deadline of Oct. 1 to meet those benchmarks .
2007_03_15_1833191	14	Administration officials have never rescinded the '' notional timeline , '' though the Iraqi government had already missed most of the deadlines by the time Ms. Rice gave it to Congress in January .
2007_03_15_1833191	15	That document listed political achievements that Washington expected would be fulfilled between September 2006 and March 2007 ; with the exception of the oil law , which awaits final passage , most have not been achieved .
2007_03_15_1833191	16	American and Iraqi officials had agreed on the notional timeline back in October .
2007_03_15_1833191	17	In interviews , Bush administration officials said that the House proposal was too rigid . ''
2007_03_15_1833191	18	The arbitrary setting of deadlines is counterproductive , '' a senior administration official said Wednesday . ''
2007_03_15_1833191	19	We need to see that they are progressing , '' the official said , but added that '' we do n't think rigid deadlines are appropriate . ''
2007_03_15_1833191	20	The Bush administration officials would agree to speak about the so-called benchmarks only on condition of anonymity , because of the politically delicate debate about whether the United States should be imposing deadlines on the Iraqi government .
2007_03_15_1833191	21	Indeed , even using the words '' deadlines '' or '' timetables '' has become politically treacherous .
2007_03_15_1833191	22	Part of the problem is that some administration officials are wary of the response from Iraq 's governing Shiites if the Americans push too hard , especially on rehabilitating past members of the Baath Party .
2007_03_15_1833191	23	That wariness is particularly acute because the administration is pushing Iraqi Shiites to bring more Sunnis into the government , as part of the political reconciliation process , at the same time that they are cracking down on Shiite militias .
2007_03_15_1833191	24	But in Baghdad , American officials seem increasingly willing to tolerate some of those Shiite militias as long as they patrol their own neighborhoods .
2007_03_15_1833191	25	Administration officials said they had eased up on parts of the timetable for re-integrating former Baathists , for fear of a Shiite backlash .
2007_03_15_1833191	26	Immediately after the American invasion four years ago , the United States pursued the opposite course by purging Baathists from positions of power .
2007_03_15_1833191	27	As part of the recent reversal , administration officials had hoped that Prime Minister Maliki would quickly agree to make room for more former Baathists in the military and elsewhere in government . ''
2007_03_15_1833191	28	We 're holding the Iraqis to their commitments on de-Baathification reform , and they 're making progress , '' another senior administration official said . ''
2007_03_15_1833191	29	But we recognize that pushing some issues too hard or too fast or with rigid timelines can carry unintended consequences -- such as intensifying the very sectarianism we all want to dampen . ''
2007_03_15_1833191	30	One Western diplomat in Baghdad said : '' We 'd like to see Iraq develop a real moderate center .
2007_03_15_1833191	31	It may not be realistic on this short a timetable . ''
2007_03_15_1833191	32	Philip D. Zelikow , until December the counselor at the State Department , said part of the delay stemmed from '' a recognition that things were worse than people realized . '' ''
2007_03_15_1833191	33	Significant parts of the new strategy need to be developed from scratch , '' he said .
2007_03_15_1833191	34	There has been some progress on the political timetable .
2007_03_15_1833191	35	On Feb. 26 , the Iraqi cabinet approved a draft of the oil law .
2007_03_15_1833191	36	The law approved by the cabinet allows the central government to distribute oil revenues to the provinces or regions based on population , which could lessen the economic concerns of the Sunni Arabs , who fear being cut out of Iraq 's vast potential oil wealth by the dominant Shiites and Kurds .
2007_03_15_1833191	37	But Parliament has yet to approve the law ; administration officials said they hoped to see approval in the next few weeks .
2007_03_15_1833191	38	The de-Baathification reversal will take much longer , administration officials say .
2007_03_15_1833191	39	There are four competing proposals on reversing de-Baathification from various political groups , including one from an Iraqi commission that includes President Jalal Talabani , which American officials say is the most promising .
2007_03_15_1833191	40	But Mr. Talabani has been ill , which has slowed down progress on the reversal of de-Baathification .
2007_03_15_1833191	41	On local elections , the official said that '' Iraqis are working toward the end of the year , and I think that 's a very reasonable goal . ''
2007_03_15_1833191	42	As for constitutional reform , administration officials say they do not have a timetable for its completion .
2007_03_15_1833193	0	Two unarmed auxiliary police officers were fatally shot last night during a chase with a gunman on a busy stretch of bars and restaurants in the heart of Greenwich Village , the authorities said .
2007_03_15_1833193	1	The gunman was shot and killed about 9:30 p.m. by regular police officers who quickly responded to the scene , the authorities said .
2007_03_15_1833193	2	The attack began after the gunman entered a pizzeria on Macdougal and West Houston Streets and shot a bartender who worked there , the authorities said .
2007_03_15_1833193	3	The two auxiliary officers -- volunteers who dress in uniforms virtually indistinguishable from regular police officers -- followed the gunman toward Sullivan Street , where he suddenly turned and shot them , the authorities said .
2007_03_15_1833193	4	The identities of the two slain officers and the gunman were unavailable early this morning .
2007_03_15_1833193	5	The bartender , whose name was also unavailable , was killed as well , the authorities said .
2007_03_15_1833193	6	It was the second time in two nights that city officers were attacked in the line of duty .
2007_03_15_1833193	7	On Tuesday night , one police officer was shot in a Harlem restaurant only 90 minutes before another was stabbed in the head at a Brooklyn subway station .
2007_03_15_1833193	8	Witnesses to last night 's shooting described a wild scene in which as many as 30 shots were fired , creating pandemonium as patrons spilled out from Village watering holes like the Lion 's Den and the Back Fence .
2007_03_15_1833193	9	In one case , a comedy act in a basement club on Bleecker Street was briefly interrupted -- although the show in fact went on . ''
2007_03_15_1833193	10	I was in the middle of my set and I heard a series of pops and someone came running downstairs and said , ' A person is being shot outside , ' '' said Hassan Madry , 28 , who was performing on stage at the Village Lantern . ''
2007_03_15_1833193	11	I tried to calm everybody down .
2007_03_15_1833193	12	I told some of my jokes .
2007_03_15_1833193	13	You know , you got to go on with it . ''
2007_03_15_1833193	14	It was unclear last night what lay behind the first shooting at the pizzeria , DeMarco 's at 146 Macdougal Street .
2007_03_15_1833193	15	The authorities said the auxiliary officers followed the gunman as he left the place and minutes later were shot outside 208 Sullivan Street , which once housed the former Triangle Social Club , the mob redoubt of Vincent ( The Chin ) Gigante .
2007_03_15_1833193	16	Hilary Elkins , 28 , who lives on Sullivan and Bleecker Streets , said she saw a man in civilian clothes running south on Sullivan about 9:30 p.m. with a gun in his hand .
2007_03_15_1833193	17	Five police officers were giving chase , she said , then suddenly opened fire on the man . ''
2007_03_15_1833193	18	There was fire coming from everywhere , '' Ms. Elkins said . ''
2007_03_15_1833193	19	There was a cop who was shooting and then took cover behind a pole . ''
2007_03_15_1833193	20	Stephen Smitty , 48 , a bar bouncer from Staten Island , was standing outside the Back Fence talking with a friend when the gunfire erupted . ''
2007_03_15_1833193	21	I was chit-chatting and all of a sudden it sounded like fireworks , '' Mr. Smitty said . ''
2007_03_15_1833193	22	I saw a cop on his knees with no hat on and soon people started talking about a dead cop . ''
2007_03_15_1833193	23	About 4,800 unarmed auxiliary officers work on a volunteer basis with the New York Police Department .
2007_03_15_1833193	24	They wear a blue uniform much like regular officers but instead of a silver badge wear a seven-pointed star that resembles a sheriff 's shield .
2007_03_15_1833193	25	The last time an auxiliary officer was killed in the line of duty was 14 years ago .
2007_03_15_1833193	26	Seventh Avenue outside St. Vincent 's Hospital Manhattan had been cordoned off by yellow police tape by the time Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly arrived .
2007_03_15_1833193	27	The officers had been taken to the hospital before they died .
2007_03_15_1833193	28	Several officers in uniforms lingered near the entryway last night .
2007_03_15_1833193	29	Even as police helicopters whipped in the sky above and squad cars by the dozen converged on the scene of the shootings , witnesses spoke of separate bursts on gunfire that split the night .
2007_03_15_1833193	30	Ray Cline , 56 , was at his mother-in-law 's apartment on LaGuardia Place when the gunfire interrupted their dessert . ''
2007_03_15_1833193	31	I was eating cherry pie with my mother-in-law on the 26th floor and then what sounded like a string of firecrackers rang out , '' he said . ''
2007_03_15_1833193	32	There were at least a dozen shots within four or five seconds and then sirens came within a minute or two . ''
2007_03_15_1833193	33	Jonas Skybakmoem , a 26-year-old musician visiting New York from Norway with his girlfriend , was having dinner at an Italian restaurant near Sullivan and Bleecker when the shots rang out . ''
2007_03_15_1833193	34	We heard the shots and I saw people in the restaurant across the street getting under the tables , '' he said . ''
2007_03_15_1833193	35	People were also running into the restaurant . ''
2007_03_15_1833193	36	Mr. Skybakmoem said that two dozen or so people in the restaurant he was in immediately sought cover in the bathrooms in back .
2007_03_15_1833193	37	Mr. Madry , the comedian , said the police and the club 's management kept patrons safely inside the bar . ''
2007_03_15_1833193	38	At first people panicked , '' he said . ''
2007_03_15_1833193	39	One girl started crying .
2007_03_15_1833193	40	I kept telling everyone to stay calm . ''
2007_03_15_1833195	0	The slayings of two auxiliary police officers last night came in a week that has underscored the dangers of routine police work in New York City .
2007_03_15_1833195	1	Just the previous night , an officer was shot in a Harlem restaurant ; another was stabbed in the head in a Brooklyn subway station about 90 minutes later .
2007_03_15_1833195	2	In each case , officers approached men they considered suspicious and tried to frisk them for weapons .
2007_03_15_1833195	3	In the first instance , in Harlem , Robert Tejada , 35 , an officer in plain clothes , was shot twice Tuesday night by a man he and three other officers in plain clothes had followed into a small restaurant , Cafe 22 , on Adam Clayton Powell Jr. .
2007_03_15_1833195	4	Boulevard near 136th Street , the police said .
2007_03_15_1833195	5	The suspect , Corey Mickins , 25 , fought back when the officers found that he was carrying a 9-millimeter pistol , the police said .
2007_03_15_1833195	6	Officer Tejada , who was wearing a bullet-resistant vest , was in stable condition yesterday at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia hospital , the police said .
2007_03_15_1833195	7	Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said he probably would not have survived without the vest .
2007_03_15_1833195	8	Mr. Mickins , whose criminal record included an attempted murder charge , was fatally shot by the other officers .
2007_03_15_1833195	9	The police said yesterday that the four officers clearly identified themselves before approaching Mr. Mickins .
2007_03_15_1833195	10	About 90 minutes later in Brooklyn , Angel Cruz , 30 , a transit officer , was alone when he encountered two men smoking cigarettes on a platform of the Broadway Junction subway station in East New York .
2007_03_15_1833195	11	Officer Cruz ordered both men upstairs to a mezzanine area of the station , where he intended to issue them summonses for smoking , the police said .
2007_03_15_1833195	12	The officer also asked the men if they were armed , the police said .
2007_03_15_1833195	13	One man cooperated and turned over a Swiss Army knife , but the other man , identified as Hugo Hernandez , 22 , became belligerent and punched Officer Cruz when he tried to frisk him , said Paul J. Browne , the Police Department 's chief spokesman .
2007_03_15_1833195	14	Mr. Hernandez 's companion rushed out of the station and was not involved or charged in what escalated into a life-and-death encounter between Officer Cruz and Mr. Hernandez that sent both to hospitals .
2007_03_15_1833195	15	Mr. Browne described a fierce struggle : Officer Cruz tried to subdue Mr. Hernandez , who pulled out a six-inch hunting knife and slashed the officer over his left ear .
2007_03_15_1833195	16	Officer Cruz staggered backward and fell to the ground near a pay telephone while Mr. Hernandez threatened him again with the knife .
2007_03_15_1833195	17	Officer Cruz responded by firing three times at Mr. Hernandez , but it was unclear if any of those shots hit him .
2007_03_15_1833195	18	Mr. Hernandez attacked Officer Cruz again , plunging the knife so hard into the officer 's temple that it entered his skull , Mr. Browne said , adding that the police had interviewed six witnesses .
2007_03_15_1833195	19	Mr. Cruz fired two more shots at Mr. Hernandez , who turned and fled downstairs to the subway platform .
2007_03_15_1833195	20	At that point , although '' he was bleeding profusely , '' Mr. Browne said , Officer Cruz ran after Mr. Hernandez down the length of the platform .
2007_03_15_1833195	21	Other officers who had been summoned found Mr. Hernandez lying on the platform and Officer Cruz kneeling on one knee about three feet away , appearing as if he was about to lose consciousness .
2007_03_15_1833195	22	Officer Cruz was in serious but stable condition at Jamaica Hospital Medical Center , the police said .
2007_03_15_1833195	23	Mr. Hernandez , charged yesterday with attempted first-degree murder of a police officer and criminal possession of a weapon , was in guarded condition at Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center after being shot twice in the elbow by Officer Cruz , the police said .
2007_03_15_1833195	24	Mr. Hernandez 's criminal record includes five arrests in New Jersey .
2007_03_15_1833195	25	In 2003 and 2004 , he was charged twice with assaulting police officers in Netcong , Mr. Browne said .
2007_03_15_1833195	26	That led to his deportation to Guatemala in July 2005 , the authorities said .
2007_03_15_1833195	27	Michael Gilhoody , a spokesman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement , said Mr. Hernandez had been deported as a felon for life and that it was unclear how he had returned to the New York area .
2007_03_15_1833195	28	Mr. Gilhoody said Mr. Hernandez 's mere presence in this country could be prosecuted as a federal felony but that any action by the federal government would await the outcome of his prosecution and potential prison term on the charges in New York .
2007_03_15_1833195	29	Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg told reporters yesterday that Officer Cruz 's stabbing was '' another example of the kinds of risk that the men and women who work in our Police Department endure every day . ''
2007_03_15_1833195	30	Mr. Hernandez had been living in Freeport , Long Island , with his brother , Roberto , who said yesterday that Mr. Hernandez had experienced bouts of serious depression throughout his life .
2007_03_15_1833195	31	He said Mr. Hernandez received some treatment recently at Nassau University Medical Center and was scheduled to meet yesterday with a representative of an outpatient psychiatric facility on Long Island .
2007_03_15_1833195	32	Roberto Hernandez said the episode could only have resulted from his brother 's depression . ''
2007_03_15_1833195	33	The word for it is insanity , '' he said . ''
2007_03_15_1833195	34	He could not have been himself . ''
2007_03_15_1833196	0	They form a kind of shadow police force , uniformed but unarmed and unpaid .
2007_03_15_1833196	1	Part community-minded volunteers and part would-be officers , they go on neighborhood patrols , help with crowd control at places like Yankee Stadium and serve as an official-looking eyes and ears .
2007_03_15_1833196	2	The city 's 4,800 or so auxiliary police officers are never far from trouble , but usually , said John W. Hyland , the president of the Auxiliary Police Benevolent Association , trouble goes the other way when they come around . ''
2007_03_15_1833196	3	For the most part , you 're on routine patrol , '' he said . ''
2007_03_15_1833196	4	For the most part , the bad guys ca n't tell the difference whether it 's an auxiliary cop or a regular cop .
2007_03_15_1833196	5	It 's one of the best crime deterrents that there is . ''
2007_03_15_1833196	6	So is the seven-pointed star that auxiliary officers wear .
2007_03_15_1833196	7	Few , other than sharp-eyed criminals , could tell that it is different from the shield that regular officers wear .
2007_03_15_1833196	8	And few would know that officially , anyway , auxiliary officers do not have the power that regular officers have : the power to make arrests . ''
2007_03_15_1833196	9	It 's a citizen 's arrest , '' Mr. Hyland said . ''
2007_03_15_1833196	10	You 're the eyes and the ears .
2007_03_15_1833196	11	You make the call . ''
2007_03_15_1833196	12	Meaning , most of the time , an auxiliary officer reaches for his or her radio and calls for regular officers .
2007_03_15_1833196	13	Until last night , six auxiliary officers had been killed in the line of duty in the half-century since the auxiliary police force was organized .
2007_03_15_1833196	14	Before the two deaths in Greenwich Village , the most recent was Milton Clarke , killed 14 years ago when he heard shots in the street outside his garage in the Bronx .
2007_03_15_1833196	15	Carrying his own licensed .380 - caliber semiautomatic pistol , he confronted a suspect who opened fire and struck him six times .
2007_03_15_1833196	16	Mr. Clarke 's gun jammed after he pulled the trigger once .
2007_03_15_1833196	17	Facing street crime was not the original mission of the auxiliary force , which was organized as a civil-defense group in the 1950s .
2007_03_15_1833196	18	Its mission reflected the nuclear paranoia of cold-war America : to direct crowds to subway stations and school basements that doubled as bomb shelters .
2007_03_15_1833196	19	Auxiliary officers attend classes on topics like handling their nightsticks and giving Miranda warnings , even though they rarely make arrests .
2007_03_15_1833196	20	The Police Department requires that auxiliary officers be older than 17 and younger than 60 , though those over 60 may apply for administrative duties .
2007_03_15_1833196	21	The department 's Web site also says that auxiliary officers must be United States citizens or have a valid visa or alien registration card , must live or work in the city , must be able to read and write English and must have a clean record . ''
2007_03_15_1833196	22	A lot of the younger guys are using it as a steppingstone to go into law enforcement , '' Mr. Hyland said . ''
2007_03_15_1833196	23	It gets them in the door .
2007_03_15_1833196	24	They see , do they really want to do this ? ''
2007_03_15_1833197	0	Greenwich Village has long been the cheery , boozy living room of Manhattan , where the word '' shoot '' is most often a reference to a game of barroom pool , not street violence .
2007_03_15_1833197	1	Last night 's shootings -- in which two auxiliary police officers , a bartender and their attacker were killed -- jarred police helicopters , officers on horseback and the swirling lights of squad cars against laughter , tipsy college students and tourists with cellphone cameras .
2007_03_15_1833197	2	As Wednesday night turned into Thursday morning , the shock of the violence seemed already to be washing away as close as half a block to the police tape crackling in the warm breeze .
2007_03_15_1833197	3	While police officers shone flashlights in windows around the corner , men hunkered in concentration in sidewalk tables over pawns and knights outside a chess shop on Thompson Street . ''
2007_03_15_1833197	4	We 've been playing chess all night , '' said a player who did not give his name . ''
2007_03_15_1833197	5	We 're distracted . ''
2007_03_15_1833197	6	Another , Douglas Miller , 42 , shrugged off the drone of helicopters from above and the clotted traffic : '' Normal chaos , you know .
2007_03_15_1833197	7	They 've cleaned the Village up .
2007_03_15_1833197	8	It 's gotten a lot better . ''
2007_03_15_1833197	9	Never mind must -- the show indeed did go on .
2007_03_15_1833197	10	Students and tourists and West Village residents streamed in and out of standby saloons like Kenny 's Castaway , the Red Lion and the Back Fence , where a guitarist , Tony DiLucco , 41 , played to about 15 people shortly after the gunfire . ''
2007_03_15_1833197	11	The vibe was tense , '' he said later . ''
2007_03_15_1833197	12	The crowd seemed into it , but a little more introspective . ''
2007_03_15_1833197	13	The most troubled faces seemed to belong to the stranded .
2007_03_15_1833197	14	Victor Santos , 42 , sitting glumly on a sidewalk planter in a business suit , said he was staying at a friend 's on Sullivan Street , and could not get home .
2007_03_15_1833197	15	Theresa Wyatt came to the city to see the comedian Colin Quinn at the Comedy Cellar . ''
2007_03_15_1833197	16	My car is on Sullivan Street , '' she said , pacing the sidewalk among drinkers taking a smoke break . ''
2007_03_15_1833197	17	People ca n't get home . ''
2007_03_15_1833197	18	To step into the Baggot Inn was to move from a street of chaos to a dark , warm refuge of folk musicians and cold beer .
2007_03_15_1833197	19	A fiddler , Josh Gordon , 48 , said he had lived in the neighborhood for 10 years , and had watched it become as safe as a playground , where violence like last night 's was all but unheard of . ''
2007_03_15_1833197	20	You have kind of serene people here , '' he said , looking about the tavern . ''
2007_03_15_1833197	21	We all know this stuff occurs .
2007_03_15_1833197	22	The individual incident should n't cause such a bump in mood , if you 're aware of the periodic occurrence of them . '' ''
2007_03_15_1833197	23	This is not a wonderful night for the street , '' he said .
2007_03_15_1833197	24	Another resident , Wendy Rubin , 24 , said she had just ducked into a store for chocolates when the shooting started . ''
2007_03_15_1833197	25	I held onto my candy and ran , '' she said . ''
2007_03_15_1833197	26	Living in the city can be very complicated sometimes , even in an outing to buy something as simple as chocolate . ''

2007_03_15_1833199	3	The ID card is the only evidence of the year that Patten spent away from sports .
2007_03_15_1833199	4	Growing up in Orange County , Calif. , Patten was a star basketball and volleyball player at El Dorado High School .
2007_03_15_1833199	5	He went to Pepperdine University in Malibu , where he kept trying to play two sports .
2007_03_15_1833199	6	He burned out on both .
2007_03_15_1833199	7	Tired of the hardwood , Patten tried the sand .

2007_03_15_1833207	6	In the round of 16 the # 2 seed , George Jacobs and Ralph Katz of Hinsdale , Ill. , Robert Levin and Zia Mahmood of New York , Michael Rosenberg of New Rochelle , N.Y. , and Steve Weinstein of Andes , N.Y. , lost to # 18 Bart Bramley of Dallas , Mark Feldman and Martin Fleisher of New York , and Michael Kamil of Holmdel , N.J. , by 161 international match points to 122 .
2007_03_15_1833207	7	The draw for the quarterfinals is # 1 Nick Nickell vs. # 25 Piotr Tuszynski , # 18 Bramley vs. # 7 Christal Henner-Welland , # 3 James Cayne vs. # 6 Ron Rubin , and # 4 Lou Ann O'Rourke vs. # 5 Rose Meltzer .
2007_03_15_1833207	8	The Cinderella run of the # 73 seed captained by Jason Feldman of San Diego came to an end when it lost to the Tuszynski team by 140 imps to 74 .
2007_03_15_1833208	0	Last week , I attended my second TED conference , which stands for Technology , Entertainment , and Design .
2007_03_15_1833208	1	During the four-day conference , you hear 50 speakers , who are given 18 minutes each .
2007_03_15_1833208	2	They are the most compelling , passionate , informed speakers you 've ever heard ( all right , maybe 45 of them are ) .
2007_03_15_1833208	3	Some bring back reports from the edge of medicine , archaeology , nanotech , neurology , psychiatry or the Web .
2007_03_15_1833208	4	Some , like Paul Simon , Tracy Chapman , and They Might Be Giants , perform live .
2007_03_15_1833208	5	But a good number of them bring you face to face with some of the most upsetting realities of human existence .
2007_03_15_1833208	6	The horrors in sub-Saharan Africa .
2007_03_15_1833208	7	The viruses that are gaining on us .
2007_03_15_1833208	8	The increasing scarcity of drinkable water .
2007_03_15_1833208	9	And over and over and over again , climate change , presented with the most harrowing examples , measurements and projections .
2007_03_15_1833208	10	John Doerr , the famous venture capitalist whose firm bootstrapped such startups as Amazon and Google , began his climate-crisis talk with the words , `` I 'm really scared .
2007_03_15_1833208	11	I do n't think we 're going to make it '' -- and ended too choked up to speak .
2007_03_15_1833208	12	Another speaker this year actually used the term `` species extinction , '' referring to ours .
2007_03_15_1833208	13	There are so many standing ovations , you 're practically doing 18-minute calisthenics .
2007_03_15_1833208	14	And the cumulative effect of the conference is devastating .
2007_03_15_1833208	15	You ca n't return to the real world thinking the same thoughts you thought before ; you just ca n't do it .
2007_03_15_1833208	16	Worse , you ca n't even explain to other people why the thing is so overwhelming .
2007_03_15_1833208	17	I had nine minutes to try in a `` CBS News Sunday Morning '' segment -- and the result fell so far short at conveying the effect , they wound up posting it online instead of airing it on TV .
2007_03_15_1833208	18	Only 1,000 people can attend TED live ( it 's in Monterey , California ) .
2007_03_15_1833208	19	The auditorium holds only 500 people ; the rest sit downstairs in a comfortable `` simulcast lounge '' and watch on flat-panel high-definition TV sets .
2007_03_15_1833208	20	( So why do n't they hold the thing in a bigger theater ?
2007_03_15_1833208	21	Last year , they held one afternoon 's talks in a Broadway-style theater .
2007_03_15_1833208	22	It was a disaster .
2007_03_15_1833208	23	The enormous hall drained all sense of intimacy , humanity and urgency from the speakers . )
2007_03_15_1833208	24	Next year 's conference is already sold out -- at $ 6,000 a ticket , if you can believe that .
2007_03_15_1833208	25	( Speakers are n't paid , but get a free pass to the conference .
2007_03_15_1833208	26	This year , I was one of about 20 uncredited `` three-minuters '' -- people who perform shorter , quirkier interstitial talks between the biggies -- and was thus given a free conference ticket . )
2007_03_15_1833208	27	Fortunately , TED has begun posting high-quality videos of the talks -- specifically re-edited for Web use -- at ted.com/tedtalks .
2007_03_15_1833208	28	You can find 65 of them already online ( mine from 2006 among them ) , ready to watch online or download to your iPod , and TED plans to make many more available .
2007_03_15_1833208	29	There 's even talk of streaming the talks live to the Web in future years , which I think would be an awesome idea .
2007_03_15_1833208	30	Anyway , over the next few days , I 'll be writing up some of the coolest , most interesting and entertaining talks I heard at TED last week on my blog at nytimes.com/pogue .
2007_03_15_1833208	31	I 'll attempt to limit myself to tech-oriented topics , although with speakers that included Bill Clinton , Richard Branson , James Randi , Lawrence Lessig , Alan Kay , Philippe Starck , Kareem Abdul-Jabbar , and others , that might not be easy .
2007_03_15_1833208	32	In the meantime , here 's your homework .
2007_03_15_1833208	33	Set aside an hour and watch three of the TED talks online back to back .
2007_03_15_1833208	34	Then check out these Web sites , whose creators were among the presenters this year : http://www.bumptop.com ( a radical new concept for the computer desktop ) http://www.wefeelfine.org ( a visual , real-time emotion meter that depicts the Internet 's bloggers ) http://www.bmwworld.com/hydrogen/ ( BMW 's fleet of hydrogen-powered cars )
2007_03_15_1833209	0	THE house that Robin Howe and her husband , Andy Grossman , share in Bridgehampton , N.Y. , is only a year old , but their living room floor dates back a century .
2007_03_15_1833209	1	Made of wide-plank teak , the floorboards have `` a lived-in feel that is attractive and old and gentle on the feet , '' said Ms. Howe , a fashion designer .
2007_03_15_1833209	2	Before the boards were in Ms. Howe 's living room they were in the McCloud , Calif. , warehouse of TerraMai , a company that sells so-called `` reclaimed '' wood from around the world ; before that , they were the floors and walls of a factory , probably near the Burmese border in Thailand , 8,000 miles from Long Island .
2007_03_15_1833209	3	As Southeast Asia continues to modernize , many teak-wood homes and buildings like that factory are being torn down and replaced with Western-style brick or concrete ones .
2007_03_15_1833209	4	While this architectural turnover has been going on for decades , in recent years American companies like TerraMai have increasingly been buying up the old-growth teak wood and selling it to homeowners like Ms. Howe , which has raised some concerns among preservationists .
2007_03_15_1833209	5	`` In the last three years , our sales of reclaimed teak have tripled , '' said Erika Carpenter , TerraMai 's co-founder .
2007_03_15_1833209	6	`` People are becoming aware , appreciating the material and designing their projects around it . ''
2007_03_15_1833209	7	In 2006 , the company disassembled 12 structures in Southeast Asia , and this year Ms. Carpenter expects to tear down about 20 .
2007_03_15_1833209	8	The wood , which sells in the United States for between $ 16.50 a square foot and $ 30 a board foot -- slightly more than new teak from the same region would cost -- is re-milled and used to make flooring , decking , countertops , staircases and cabinetry , among other things .
2007_03_15_1833209	9	( For teak flooring , the cost is about three times that of a typical oak floor . )
2007_03_15_1833209	10	Global Surroundings , a furnishings manufacturer near Phoenix , has had similar success with its Rusteaka and ChicTeak lines of outdoor furniture made from Indonesian homes .
2007_03_15_1833209	11	According to J. L. Jackson , the company 's founder , Global Surroundings imported six shipping containers of vintage teak furniture in 2006 and will double that number this year .
2007_03_15_1833209	12	Ms. Jackson said she initially had difficulty convincing retailers to stock her tables and chairs , but an increased interest in the environmental benefits of recycled resources has helped spark sales , as has the popularity of outdoor furniture , for which old teak is well suited .
2007_03_15_1833209	13	Then there 's the matter of character .
2007_03_15_1833209	14	`` You have to buy into it , and understand that this is a great story when you 're sitting around your coffee table , '' she said .
2007_03_15_1833209	15	Old teak lumber seems to hold much the same appeal for many Americans .
2007_03_15_1833209	16	`` They 've definitely had previous lives , '' Ms. Howe said of her floorboards .
2007_03_15_1833209	17	`` There 's a history in them that may be hundreds of years old , and I 've become a part of that . ''
2007_03_15_1833209	18	Not everyone , though , is happy to see Westerners like Ms. Howe claiming a place in that history .
2007_03_15_1833209	19	Tanet Charoenmuang , the vice president of the Urban Development Institute Foundation in Chiang Mai , Thailand , which advocates for historical preservation in the rapidly modernizing city , is worried that his country is slowly losing its identity , as old teak villas , docks , hotels , tobacco barns and granaries vanish .
2007_03_15_1833209	20	`` Houses are sold one after another after another , and , finally , all gone , '' Dr. Tanet said .
2007_03_15_1833209	21	`` Finally , the culture will be gone , too . ''
2007_03_15_1833209	22	Although Ms. Carpenter , like other importers of reclaimed wood , says that she only purchases buildings that were going to be demolished anyway , or are already for sale , Dr. Tanet believes the money offered by these dealers inevitably encourages teardowns .
2007_03_15_1833209	23	`` At first , someone may have never thought of selling '' a home , he said , but the financial incentive , combined with the growing popularity of Western-style brick and concrete houses with modern conveniences like air-conditioning , has spurred the selling off of teak .
2007_03_15_1833209	24	The result , Dr. Tanet said , is that `` the wooden culture gives way to the concrete . ''
2007_03_15_1833209	25	Nonetheless , Jeffrey Hayward , an auditor for the Rainforest Alliance conservation organization , who lived on the island of Java in Indonesia for six years , sees some benefit in the demand for vintage teak , in that it promotes reuse .
2007_03_15_1833209	26	`` If there was no market for recycled teak , '' said Mr. Hayward , who witnessed a similar selling off on Java , `` it would basically end up as waste . ''
2007_03_15_1833209	27	The perceived ecological advantages of building with vintage teak appealed to Dr. Richard Ostreicher , a California-based dermatologist who drives a hybrid car and owns a vacation house in Hawaii that uses solar power .
2007_03_15_1833209	28	When he wanted to put a gazebo in his Oakland backyard two years ago , he bypassed the big-box home stores and found a structure made of teak from an old joglo , an ornate style of Indonesian house .
2007_03_15_1833209	29	`` It 's original , it 's gorgeous and you 're not taking down any new trees , '' said Dr. Ostreicher , who bought the gazebo from Gado Gado International , a furniture and crafts importer in Santa Rosa , Calif. , paying about $ 11,000 .
2007_03_15_1833209	30	`` This is a beautiful work of art , and if it were just left on the road somewhere it might be lost . ''
2007_03_15_1833209	31	Teak is `` a pretty wood , it 's extremely durable and it 's multipurpose , '' said Harvey Green , the author of `` Wood : Craft , Culture , History '' ( Viking , 2006 ) , explaining teak 's centuries-old popularity with furniture makers and shipbuilders , who valued the way its resin repelled water , rot and termites .
2007_03_15_1833209	32	While teak is still grown and harvested in parts of Southeast Asia , salvaged wood is especially prized , Mr. Green said , because much of it came from old-growth forests , which produce the sturdiest and handsomest lumber .
2007_03_15_1833209	33	After years of these supplies being depleted , many countries in the region have strict laws limiting over-harvesting , and old-growth teak has become a rare commodity , according to Mr. Hayward .
2007_03_15_1833209	34	Finding and exporting this sought-after old-growth teak is the job of hunters like Ms. Carpenter , who has gone on buying trips to Southeast Asia every one to three months since TerraMai began selling teak in 2000 .
2007_03_15_1833209	35	On one such trip last July , she visited a village outside Chiang Mai , on a tip from one of TerraMai 's local agents that a woman there was interested in selling her house .
2007_03_15_1833209	36	Approaching the home in question , one of a row of simple but sturdy wooden structures raised on stilts , she scratched a support beam , sniffing for the sharp , leathery smell of teak .
2007_03_15_1833209	37	A white-haired woman sitting at a table nearby pointed to garlic drying beneath the raised floor and asked Ms. Carpenter if she had come to buy some .
2007_03_15_1833209	38	`` No , '' Ms. Carpenter told the old woman in Thai , `` I came to buy the house . ''
2007_03_15_1833209	39	After locating the property owner , a middle - aged woman , Ms. Carpenter spoke to her through an interpreter .
2007_03_15_1833209	40	The owner explained that she had inherited the house from a relative , but did not need it .
2007_03_15_1833209	41	Her reason for selling to Ms. Carpenter was simple : If the home were put on the local market , the lot would bring a modest sum , but traders in salvaged teak -- both local buyers and foreigners like Ms. Carpenter -- are willing to pay hundreds of dollars per cubic meter , or more than $ 50,000 for an entire house .
2007_03_15_1833209	42	Many homeowners in Southeast Asia use teak `` like a bank , '' said Philippe Guizol , a researcher who frequently works with the Center for International Forestry Research , a conservation organization based in Indonesia .
2007_03_15_1833209	43	`` If you need cash and you have teak in your floor , you just sell it , '' Mr. Guizol said .
2007_03_15_1833209	44	But Ms. Carpenter says she avoids buying houses that people would otherwise continue living in , as well as historic landmarks like temples .
2007_03_15_1833209	45	She noted that she is required by the Thai government to process the wood -- re-mill or dry it -- before shipping it to the United States , so the country 's resources are not being removed without an investment in local labor .
2007_03_15_1833209	46	Importers point out that the wood can last another century or more , even if the shift in context is stark , said Mark Suess , a designer for Global Surroundings .
2007_03_15_1833209	47	In his home in St. Cloud , Minn. , the pocked floorboards running from the front door to the dining room were planed smooth years earlier for use in Indonesian homes .
2007_03_15_1833209	48	The cabinet where his family stores cookbooks was for decades an altar and reliquary where people prayed .
2007_03_15_1833209	49	The result is an exchange of cultural styles , as Americans like Mr. Suess embrace an old-fashioned Asian aesthetic , while many Southeast Asians look to contemporary Western design .
2007_03_15_1833209	50	Ms. Howe of Bridgehampton , who frequently travels to Southeast Asia for business , said that in the last decade the replacement of wooden structures with Western - style buildings has been obvious .
2007_03_15_1833209	51	`` It seems almost natural that they would be changing and updating , '' she said .
2007_03_15_1833209	52	`` And then one day they 'll probably want their old teak back again . ''
2007_01_15_1819017	0	You might think it would be difficult to fashion an entertaining account of the life of a polyester manufacturer , even a fictitious one .
2007_01_15_1819017	1	But the Tamil director Mani Ratnam , known for intelligent political dramas , has done so with '' Guru , '' an epic paean to can-do spirit and Mumbai capitalism .
2007_01_15_1819017	2	Guru is the nickname of Gurukant Desai ( played by the busy Bollywood star Abhishek Bachchan , lately in '' Dhoom 2 '' and '' Umrao Jaan '' ) , who leaves his home in rural Gujarat state for work , but later returns determined , he says more than once , not to work for the white man .
2007_01_15_1819017	3	On his way to becoming a business mogul , he deals in textiles , establishes the Shakti Corporation and builds factories , fueled by ( another refrain ) his aversion to the word '' no . ''
2007_01_15_1819017	4	He also tussles with meddlesome relatives , a press lord ( Mithun Chakraborty ) and of course the government .
2007_01_15_1819017	5	Fortunately he has his devoted wife , Sujata ( the stunning Aishwarya Rai , here hardheaded and practical ) , to lend support .
2007_01_15_1819017	6	Given a rich , multidimensional role , Mr. Bachchan ably seizes on its abundant opportunities .
2007_01_15_1819017	7	Mr. Ratnam 's experience shows in his gorgeous compositions and fluency with pacing and effects ; the inevitable , though unobtrusive , musical sequences display a similar command .
2007_01_15_1819017	8	His convictions are evident when Guru is accused by the authorities of corruption .
2007_01_15_1819017	9	Defending himself , Guru exalts India 's rising influence : '' You call us the third world ; why ca n't we be the first world ? ''
2007_01_15_1819017	10	He adds , '' Shall we tell the world that we are coming ? ''
2007_01_15_1819017	11	The soundtrack responds with martial rhythms signaling a national dynamo barreling forward .
2007_01_15_1819017	12	Guru Opened on Friday nationwide .

2007_01_15_1819018	0	LOOKING for a bargain weekend flight from New York to Florida ?
2007_01_15_1819018	1	OneSky.com may have just the ticket , assuming you have $ 9,500 to spend , and you can find a return flight .
2007_01_15_1819018	2	The $ 9,500 does n't sound much like a bargain until you compare it with the $ 30,000 that a private jet flight might otherwise cost .
2007_01_15_1819018	3	OneSky is one of a growing number of Web sites catering to this era 's true jet set -- private jet aficionados willing to spend thousands of dollars on a one-way flight as long as it does not involve security lines , airport parking garages and competition for overhead baggage space .
2007_01_15_1819018	4	Because private jet passengers typically remain at their destinations for a few days , their pilots often fly back to their home airports after the drop-off .
2007_01_15_1819018	5	As a result , the nation 's 5,000 or so private jets that offer charter flights travel empty 40 percent of the time .
2007_01_15_1819018	6	Aircraft owners are happy to fill those planes even at greatly reduced prices , to help defray the costs of maintenance and storage .
2007_01_15_1819018	7	The Internet at least gives private jet operators a place to market their so-called empty-leg flights , rather than forcing travelers or travel agents to canvass carriers to find who may have an available flight .
2007_01_15_1819018	8	The online market for private jet bookings is rising , executives at OneSky , Jets.com and other flight brokers said , because of advances in booking technology on the part of private jet operators , and at Web sites that are serving them .
2007_01_15_1819018	9	The category itself is still comparatively small , with industry executives estimating that about 200,000 people in the United States fly privately each year , either on their own jets or through charter companies .
2007_01_15_1819018	10	But with some studies indicating that the superrich are accumulating more wealth , and with commercial airline travel reaching new heights of inconvenience , that number could spike .
2007_01_15_1819018	11	And high-income travelers with at least some sense of financial austerity and a flexible schedule say that booking online beats owning all or part of a private jet , which can cost $ 250,000 annually .
2007_01_15_1819018	12	Take James Gay for one .
2007_01_15_1819018	13	Mr. Gay , a resident of Fredericksburg , Va. , owns retail and real estate businesses and has used private jets twice in the last year when flying with Suzie , his 12-year-old mutt , so she can avoid the conditions imposed on pets who fly on commercial airlines .
2007_01_15_1819018	14	Mr. Gay said that by booking online through OneSky , he typically spent about $ 21,500 for each leg of a cross-country trip , which , he said , was considerably less expensive than the cost of a flight booked through a fractional ownership program .
2007_01_15_1819018	15	In such programs , through Blue Star Jets , Sentient Jet and others , members often pay $ 100,000 or more for the right to book a last-minute flight on a private jet , and are debited hourly fees for each flight . ''
2007_01_15_1819018	16	Even though I was doing it for the dog , I tried to do it so the cost was reasonable in my head , '' Mr. Gay said . ''
2007_01_15_1819018	17	This was a great value . ''
2007_01_15_1819018	18	Such flights can be a lot less expensive than they appear , since prices from private jet operators include all of a plane 's seats .
2007_01_15_1819018	19	Greg Johnson , OneSky 's chief executive , said that on many flights between New York to Florida , for instance , buyers manage to fill the plane , putting the cost for each passenger at about $ 1,500 .
2007_01_15_1819018	20	That is still substantially more than a first-class ticket on a major airline , but the perks are considerable . ''
2007_01_15_1819018	21	At an awful lot of airports you can actually pull your car up to the airplane , '' Mr. Johnson said . ''
2007_01_15_1819018	22	There 's none of this ` arrive an hour early and park in the remote lot ' stuff .
2007_01_15_1819018	23	And once you 're on the plane gourmet caterers can provide you with almost any meal . ''
2007_01_15_1819018	24	Mr. Johnson would not disclose his site 's revenue , since his company is privately held , but he said that sales doubled in the last six months despite an '' extremely modest marketing spend . ''
2007_01_15_1819018	25	OneSky , which started in 2004 , represents the second wave of Internet sites in the category .
2007_01_15_1819018	26	The first wave came during the dot-com boom , when companies like FlightTime.com and CharterHub.com received tens of millions of dollars from venture capitalists who believed that the Web could help private jet owners find their customers more easily than in the pre-Internet era .
2007_01_15_1819018	27	( Many of the companies have since folded or changed hands . )
2007_01_15_1819018	28	During that first wave , though , many private jet operators lacked the technology to help Web sites reliably track and predict the availability of their aircraft .
2007_01_15_1819018	29	Consumers , too , may not have been ready to trust a Web site with a $ 25,000 booking .
2007_01_15_1819018	30	Industry executives say that jet operators are more technologically savvy now , and Web sites are also refining their approaches .
2007_01_15_1819018	31	OneSky , for instance , has enlisted the help of Trey Urbahn , JetBlue 's chief revenue officer , to help the company set prices that would maximize demand .
2007_01_15_1819018	32	Mr. Urbahn , who also serves as OneSky 's chairman , helped the company develop technology that anticipates demand for particular routes and changes prices accordingly . ''
2007_01_15_1819018	33	Based on what Trey learned from his career in the airline pricing game , we 'll buy a plane for $ 13,000 going to West Palm from Teterboro , '' he said , referring to the small airport in northern New Jersey popular among corporate fliers commuting to and from New York City . ''
2007_01_15_1819018	34	We might sell the first half of that trip for $ 10,000 , so all we 'll need to do is get $ 3,000 to get the plane back home to make it work , but odds are we could sell it for another $ 10,000 . ''
2007_01_15_1819018	35	Mr. Johnson says that this pricing strategy is more scientific than that of many other private jet agents who may have extensive experience with certain clients , specific routes or peak periods of the year , but who may not know how to price a trip request properly that falls outside those parameters .
2007_01_15_1819018	36	One of OneSky 's competitors , Jets.com , based in Quincy , Mass. , uses a different approach .
2007_01_15_1819018	37	The company 's chief executive , Nathan McKelvey , says that the Web site takes a prospective customer 's flight request and circulates it among roughly 200 private jet operators , who then bid for the right to carry the passenger .
2007_01_15_1819018	38	Jets.com charges an undisclosed but fixed commission on each sale .
2007_01_15_1819018	39	Mr. McKelvey said that the average trip request received four bids , while more popular routes like New York to Florida usually yielded more than 10 bids .
2007_01_15_1819018	40	Jets.com 's sales jumped by 50 percent , to $ 25 million last year , he said , and the company was profitable . ''
2007_01_15_1819018	41	I do n't know if there are more affluent people now , but there are a lot of customers who are new to the private jet market , '' Mr. McKelvey said .
2007_01_15_1819018	42	Marcia Lee Morrissey , a sales executive with Segrave Aviation , which manages a fleet of 20 private jets belonging to independent owners , said that Web sites had '' certainly helped us fill the legs we need to fill . ''
2007_01_15_1819018	43	Mr. Morrissey said she accepted business from a multitude of brokers like OneSky or Blue Star Jets , which book flights on a customer 's behalf .
2007_01_15_1819018	44	Blue Star , which is privately held , claims to be the biggest broker of private jet flights , in addition to operating jets that are fractionally owned .
2007_01_15_1819018	45	A Blue Star spokesman , Ryan Auer , said that the company 's Web site ( BlueStarJets.com ) offered customers a way to see available flights for certain routes . ''
2007_01_15_1819018	46	It 's always been an option , but it 's very difficult to create software to manage , '' he said . ''
2007_01_15_1819018	47	So we 've been taking more advantage of it recently . ''
2007_01_15_1819018	48	Mr. Gay , for one , is grateful for the trend . ''
2007_01_15_1819018	49	There 's no stress , '' he said of flying privately . ''
2007_01_15_1819018	50	You do n't have the lines , you 're not in the plane with all the other people where you have all these diseases going around , you do n't have to go and wait for a couple of hours .
2007_01_15_1819018	51	You end up having a wonderful day . ''

2007_01_15_1819022	2	We are very happy to have China as our big brother in this region , '' President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo of the Philippines said at the opening ceremony of the one-day meeting in Cebu , a central Philippine province .
2007_01_15_1819022	3	Prime Minister Wen Jiabao of China said the agreement he signed with Asean leaders would '' lay the foundation for the full and scheduled completion of a China-Asean free trade agreement . ''
2007_01_15_1819022	4	China and Asean began lowering barriers to trade in 2005 .
2007_01_15_1819022	5	Since then , tariffs on more than 7,000 products from China and Asean have been lowered , Mr. Wen said .

2007_01_15_1819022	9	Although Asean members had independently urged a return to the talks , officials acknowledged on Sunday the role the Chinese played in pushing the agenda . ''
2007_01_15_1819022	10	We reaffirmed that the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is an international priority , '' the leaders said in a statement released late Saturday .

2007_01_15_1819023	0	Did you miss Eminem 's hit movie '' 8 Mile '' ?
2007_01_15_1819023	1	You 're in luck : Many of its rap battles and other major scenes are available for viewing on YouTube , the video-sharing Web site owned by Google .
2007_01_15_1819023	2	Indeed , until recently , the entire film was there , broken up into 12 nine-minute chunks to get around YouTube 's ban on longer clips .
2007_01_15_1819023	3	An 18-year-old YouTube user calling himself Yosickoyo posted the movie six months ago .
2007_01_15_1819023	4	He declined to give his real name , but said in an e-mail message that he had made the film available as a favor to others who had shared movies . ''
2007_01_15_1819023	5	I just want to thank them by uploading a movie that I have , '' he wrote .
2007_01_15_1819023	6	NBC Universal , whose Universal Pictures distributed '' 8 Mile '' in 2002 , did not appreciate the gesture .
2007_01_15_1819023	7	The company asked YouTube to take down the clips after it learned of them from a reporter .
2007_01_15_1819023	8	It was not the first time .
2007_01_15_1819023	9	NBC Universal has three employees who troll the site every day looking for studio-owned material , and they send more than 1,000 such requests a month to YouTube . ''
2007_01_15_1819023	10	There is only so much we can do , '' said Rick Cotton , NBC Universal 's general counsel , who estimated that more than half the videos on YouTube featuring NBC Universal 's television shows and films were unauthorized .
2007_01_15_1819023	11	As fast as a clip is taken down , he said , YouTube users '' can always put up another . ''
2007_01_15_1819023	12	As YouTube , with the backing of Google , becomes a powerful force in the media world , Hollywood studios and other entertainment companies are trying to figure out if it is friend or foe .
2007_01_15_1819023	13	After all , YouTube distributes unauthorized clips of the movies that the studios spend an average of $ 96 million to make .
2007_01_15_1819023	14	But it can also help them build tremendous buzz , and that is driving Hollywood to try to work with it instead of against it .
2007_01_15_1819023	15	Hoping to avoid some of the problems in the music industry that arose from illegal downloading of songs , all of the major studios -- including NBC Universal , Warner Brothers Entertainment , which is owned by Time Warner , and the News Corporation 's 20th Century Fox , are in negotiations with YouTube seeking licensing agreements that would make their content legally available on the site .
2007_01_15_1819023	16	In the meantime , they are also pressing YouTube to adopt filtering mechanisms more quickly to keep unlawful material from even showing up .
2007_01_15_1819023	17	And several media companies are in talks to create their own YouTube-like site , a move some in the industry suggest is a form of posturing to help push the licensing negotiations forward . ''
2007_01_15_1819023	18	I think studios will sue if they do n't get a licensing deal they like , '' said Jessica Litman , a professor at the University of Michigan Law School . ''
2007_01_15_1819023	19	My guess is if I were a movie studio , getting a cut of the money is more profitable than shutting it down .
2007_01_15_1819023	20	But it 's complicated , very complicated , and it 's only going to get worse . ''
2007_01_15_1819023	21	Google also has a lot resting on how these copyright issues are resolved , because investors are eager to see whether the $ 1.65 billion it paid for YouTube was well-spent .
2007_01_15_1819023	22	Chris Maxcy , vice president of business development for YouTube , declined to be interviewed , but he said in an e-mail message that YouTube had successfully worked with studios to market their movies and sought deals with studios to make their content more widely available . ''
2007_01_15_1819023	23	In fact , we 're now in discussions with several studios to create both content partnerships and revenue-sharing opportunities , '' he wrote .
2007_01_15_1819023	24	Much of the content on YouTube , of course , has nothing to do with Hollywood -- like the thousands of video blogs created by teenagers with Web cams .
2007_01_15_1819023	25	But there is enough copyrighted material there to warrant the attention of the studios and many other media companies -- everything from the dancing penguins of the new film '' Happy Feet '' to the black-and-white television clips of the Beatles singing '' Help . ''
2007_01_15_1819023	26	No one knows exactly how much Hollywood-derived content is uploaded to the site without the studios ' consent , but academics and media executives estimate it could be anywhere from 30 percent to 70 percent .
2007_01_15_1819023	27	The studios are happy to have some of their content on YouTube .
2007_01_15_1819023	28	Marc Shmuger , chairman of Universal Pictures , said that for each new release , Universal 's marketing team sends out a digital '' tool kit '' to sites like YouTube with studio-approved graphics , clips , sound effects and music videos that can be shared .
2007_01_15_1819023	29	Because '' 8 Mile '' was released four years ago , its kit may have only included trailers and some clips . ''
2007_01_15_1819023	30	I think that the marketing side of our company and the copyright-protection side have contradictory impulses , '' Mr. Shmuger said . ''
2007_01_15_1819023	31	But there is a huge appetite for content , and we are well-advised to recognize that appetite and find constructive ways to feed it . ''
2007_01_15_1819023	32	Mr. Shmuger said the studios need to embrace sites like YouTube because they are the future of movie marketing . ''
2007_01_15_1819023	33	If you want to be involved in the cultural debate , you have to allow consumers to be more actively involved , '' he said . ''
2007_01_15_1819023	34	That 's a different world order which we are not used to . ''
2007_01_15_1819023	35	One scene Mr. Shmuger said would most certainly not have been part of the '' 8 Mile '' tool kit -- one that shows up in 16 separate videos on YouTube -- is the climactic rap battle between Eminem 's character Bunny Rabbit and Papa Doc .
2007_01_15_1819023	36	But from the perspective of a YouTube user , it is hard to tell which clips are studio-approved and which are not .
2007_01_15_1819023	37	Some clips from companies like CBS and NBC that have deals with YouTube are fairly easy to identify as authorized material .
2007_01_15_1819023	38	For the rest , said Pamela Samuelson , co-director of the Berkeley Center for Law and Technology , '' what you have is a gap between what people think is O.K. and what is over the line . ''
2007_01_15_1819023	39	Already , several major music companies , including Universal Music Group , once a corporate sibling to Universal Pictures but now owned by Vivendi , have forged agreements with YouTube , which makes its money from advertising , that allows music to be played in videos for a fee .
2007_01_15_1819023	40	So in an odd twist , Eminem 's songs from '' 8 Mile '' are cleared for use on YouTube , while much of the accompanying video is not .
2007_01_15_1819023	41	In what could be an indication of the kinds of deals the studios might strike , Universal Music earns the higher of two amounts when its songs are used in a video : a flat fee per clip or a percentage of advertising revenue . ''
2007_01_15_1819023	42	We do n't want to kill this , '' said Larry Kenswil , a Universal Music executive . ''
2007_01_15_1819023	43	We see this as a new source of revenue for us . ''
2007_01_15_1819023	44	Where studios and music companies see the most complicated copyright issue is in the posting of mashups -- clips that incorporate video and music from various sources that has been '' mashed up '' to make something new .
2007_01_15_1819023	45	Most mashups are made by eager fans as a form of artistic expression or a demonstration of their editing skills . ''
2007_01_15_1819023	46	I do n't consider any of this stuff piracy , '' said Professor Litman of the University of Michigan . ''
2007_01_15_1819023	47	Folks are taking snippets and making them their own . ''
2007_01_15_1819023	48	One video posted last March , credited to Kusoyaro Productions , includes clips from the 20th Century Fox film '' Napoleon Dynamite '' that have been cleverly edited to create a new music video for Eminem 's song '' Lose Yourself '' from '' 8 Mile . ''
2007_01_15_1819023	49	The two movies ' heroes could n't be more different : Napoleon Dynamite is an awkward teenager in rural Idaho who stuffs his pockets with tater tots , while Eminem 's character in '' 8 Mile '' finds refuge from his trailer-park life by rapping in clubs .
2007_01_15_1819023	50	The video has been watched more than 60,000 times .
2007_01_15_1819023	51	Ron Wheeler , a senior vice president of content protection at Fox Entertainment Group , said that even though Fox was not being paid for the right to use the '' Napoleon Dynamite '' clips , the company had not asked that the video be taken down . ''
2007_01_15_1819023	52	We are not in the business of just saying no , but we do consider it unauthorized use , '' Mr. Wheeler said .
2007_01_15_1819023	53	He predicted , though , that the studio would be saying '' no '' more often in the future .
2007_01_15_1819023	54	Fox is working on a policy that will address the issue of mashups in a way that those creating them can understand . ''
2007_01_15_1819023	55	We will offer as much freedom as legally able , but at the same time it will be less than some people are doing now , '' Mr. Wheeler added . ''
2007_01_15_1819023	56	It wo n't be ` anything goes . ' ''
2007_01_15_1819023	57	Brian Grazer , a producer of '' 8 Mile , '' said some of the mashups he had seen were '' pretty hip . ''
2007_01_15_1819023	58	But he said he , too , viewed them as a form of piracy : '' It bothers me artistically .
2007_01_15_1819023	59	Here 's this thing where you have no control ; they are chopping it up and putting your memories in a blender . ''
2007_01_15_1819023	60	Directors may have a tough time accepting the wild world of mashups , particularly those who have been given control over the final cut of their movies .
2007_01_15_1819023	61	Mr. Grazer said he believed that Curtis Hanson , who directed '' 8 Mile , '' would not be pleased . ''
2007_01_15_1819023	62	Something like this drives an auteur nuts , '' he said .
2007_01_15_1819023	63	Mr. Hanson did not return calls seeking comment .
2007_01_15_1819023	64	Eminem , through a spokesman , declined to comment .
2007_01_15_1819023	65	But film , television and music companies are not the only ones in Hollywood seeking to protect their rights as online video spreads .
2007_01_15_1819023	66	The industry 's guilds , too , are exploring what rights directors , writers , producers and actors will be afforded in the digital era . ''
2007_01_15_1819023	67	This is a thorny issue , '' Mr. Wheeler said .
2007_01_15_1819023	68	The Directors Guild of America is already taking a hard line .
2007_01_15_1819023	69	The guild 's president , Michael Apted , said in a statement that he and his fellow directors would challenge the unauthorized use of any work . ''
2007_01_15_1819023	70	We will aggressively protect our members ' creative and economic rights , '' he said .
2007_01_15_1819023	71	For an indication of ways that the relationship between studios and YouTube might unfold , many in the industry are pointing to two recent events .
2007_01_15_1819023	72	Universal Music sued MySpace , the social networking site , for copyright infringement .
2007_01_15_1819023	73	And when Google closed the YouTube deal it set aside as much as $ 200 million for potential copyright litigation .
2007_01_15_1819023	74	YouTube said in September that it would introduce a new mechanism to filter out unauthorized videos and let owners claim their content by the end of the year , but it is still being developed .
2007_01_15_1819023	75	Mr. Cotton , the NBC Universal lawyer , said that the YouTube removal-request game could continue for only so long . ''
2007_01_15_1819023	76	Sand is running out of the hourglass , '' he said . ''
2007_01_15_1819023	77	Companies are n't prepared to sit by and not let this be addressed . ''
2007_01_15_1819024	0	The People 's Temple , the cult that expired in the mass suicide and murder organized by Jim Jones , is often regarded as a cancer that 1960s utopianism wrought , a disease of idealism splintered and sent off course .
2007_01_15_1819024	1	By the early 1970s Mr. Jones , then leading his movement out of San Francisco , had branded himself a Christian Socialist , advocating for the poor and racially oppressed .
2007_01_15_1819024	2	So respected was he within Northern California 's Democratic Party machine that Willie Brown , then a state assemblyman , once compared him to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. .
2007_01_15_1819024	3	It was in 1977 , after temple members started accusing Mr. Jones of abuse and the news media attention around him grew significantly less favorable , that he moved his followers to Jonestown in Guyana , where despite an operating mode of paranoid tyranny he permitted the formation of a commune basketball team .
2007_01_15_1819024	4	Among its most impassioned players was Stephan Jones , one of Mr. Jones 's sons .
2007_01_15_1819024	5	His testimony , though all too brief , in '' Jonestown : Paradise Lost , '' to be broadcast on the History Channel tonight , is reason enough to watch a documentary that would otherwise merely invite dim circumspection .
2007_01_15_1819024	6	Having successfully battled his father to let the team leave the Jonestown compound and play a game in Guyana 's capital in the middle of November 1978 , Stephan Jones survived the demise of his father 's ruinous experiment . ''
2007_01_15_1819024	7	Jonestown : Paradise Lost '' methodically clocks through the cult 's final days , when Representative Leo Ryan of California 's 11th District arrived in Guyana with reporters and family members of People 's Temple followers to investigate continued complaints about Mr. Jones 's mistreatment of his supplicants .
2007_01_15_1819024	8	Just as the group was to leave , Mr. Jones 's gunmen killed Mr. Ryan and the defectors he was taking back to the United States .
2007_01_15_1819024	9	Cult members killed themselves later that day .
2007_01_15_1819024	10	If Stephan Jones , a trim man on the youthful side of middle age , is mesmerizing to watch , it is because he does not seem to carry the weight of ambivalence with him .
2007_01_15_1819024	11	He has never grieved for his father , he says dispassionately ; he simply does n't see the point . ''
2007_01_15_1819024	12	I knew , I had known for a long time , that my father was nuts , '' Mr. Jones says .
2007_01_15_1819024	13	One thousand questions go unasked of him .
2007_01_15_1819024	14	In another instance , Mr. Jones says , '' Every hour of the day , Jim Jones knew he was a fraud . ''
2007_01_15_1819024	15	At that moment it might have behooved the interviewer to prod with a gentle question like : '' Really ?
2007_01_15_1819024	16	How did you know ? ''
2007_01_15_1819024	17	But such questions hang in the air like a dense fog .
2007_01_15_1819024	18	Mr. Jones is not the only survivor who appears to tell his story , but what drives '' Paradise Lost '' at the expense of an inquiring spirit is that hallmark of the contemporary television documentary : the re-enactment .
2007_01_15_1819024	19	It is one thing to recreate the signing of the Treaty of Ghent , but quite another to deploy the technique to depict events for which there are interesting living witnesses , not to mention archival footage ( used only sparingly here ) .
2007_01_15_1819024	20	What is the purpose of casting an actor as Jim Jones ?
2007_01_15_1819024	21	The effect , I can tell you , is a reminder that in our collective imagination all cult leaders end up looking like Elvis .
2007_01_15_1819024	22	Jonestown Paradise Lost History Channel , tonight at 9 , Eastern and Pacific times ; 8 , Central time .

2007_01_15_1819025	0	Music history tells us of two great traditions that emanated from Vienna .
2007_01_15_1819025	1	The first was the classical period of the late 18th century , in which Haydn and Mozart standardized the symphony , string quartet and keyboard sonata into an international norm .
2007_01_15_1819025	2	Then , at the turn of the 20th century , the Second Viennese School of Schoenberg , Berg and Webern swept the old rules under the rug .
2007_01_15_1819025	3	In a concert on Friday night at the Church of St. Vincent Ferrer , on Lexington Avenue at 66th Street , the New York Collegium focused on an earlier generation of Viennese composers , those employed by Austria 's Hapsbourg emperors in the 17th century .
2007_01_15_1819025	4	In the music of Heinrich Ignaz Franz von Biber , Johann Heinrich Schmelzer , Pavel Josef Vejvanovsky and their contemporaries during the 1680s and '90s , the prevalent Italian mode of florid melody was wedded to a German passion for counterpoint and sophisticated harmony , according to a program note by the violinist Robert Mealy .
2007_01_15_1819025	5	The program , which was assembled by the early-brass specialist Greg Ingles , emphasized works in which brass instruments were heard alongside strings and continuo .
2007_01_15_1819025	6	That combination might seem impractical today given the brightness and power of modern trumpets and trombones .
2007_01_15_1819025	7	But Mr. Ingles 's dusky , small-bore trombone , Mr. Mealy 's incisive violin and Jay Elfenbein 's purring viola da gamba were evenly matched in a sonata by the Vienna-based Italian composer Antonio Bertali .
2007_01_15_1819025	8	The trumpeters Kris Ingles and Carl Albach , wielding instruments that were little more than long , looped tubes , mustered exacting articulation and sterling tone .
2007_01_15_1819025	9	Ms. Ingles sounded tentative in a Biber sonata near the beginning of the program but grew stronger throughout the evening .
2007_01_15_1819025	10	In the concluding work , a chaconne by Phillip Jakob Rittler , she exchanged handsomely etched lines with Mr. Albach , two violinists and two violists .
2007_01_15_1819025	11	The highlights of the concert were works by Schmelzer , a ceaselessly inventive composer and a virtuoso violinist .
2007_01_15_1819025	12	His '' Lamento sopra la morte Ferdinandi III '' vividly depicted a mournful funeral procession and tolling church bells .
2007_01_15_1819025	13	Mr. Mealy , a precise , extrovert performer , gave a thrilling account of Schmelzer 's '' Sonata tertia '' ( from '' Sonatae unarum fidium , '' 1664 ) , sensitively accompanied by the harpsichordist Eric Milnes .
2007_01_15_1819025	14	Mr. Milnes had a turn in the spotlight with a canzona for solo organ by Johann Caspar Kerll .
2007_01_15_1819025	15	In another work by that composer , a sonata for two violins , Mr. Mealy 's flamboyance was matched by lithe , judicious playing from Cynthia Roberts .
2007_01_15_1819025	16	That such relatively esoteric music drew a large , enthusiastic audience was a testament to this ensemble 's compelling advocacy .
2007_01_15_1819026	0	EXECUTIVE SENTENCING -- The former chairman of the Cendant Corporation , Walter A. Forbes ( below ) , is to be sentenced Wednesday after his conviction at the end of October on charges related to large-scale accounting fraud at the conglomerate , which has since been broken up .
2007_01_15_1819026	1	It took eight years and three trials for federal prosecutors to prevail against Mr. Forbes .
2007_01_15_1819026	2	EXPERT WITNESS -- The Federal Reserve chairman , Ben S. Bernanke , will testify before the Senate Budget Committee on Thursday , and he is expected to discuss the outlook for the economy .
2007_01_15_1819026	3	Mr. Bernanke has said in the past that he would try not to take partisan sides on specific budget matters .
2007_01_15_1819026	4	President Bush will present his budget proposal on Feb. 5 .
2007_01_15_1819026	5	RETAILERS CONVENE -- The National Retail Federation 's big annual conference , which started Sunday , will continue through Wednesday at the Javits Convention Center in New York .
2007_01_15_1819026	6	The trade group plans to show off a '' store of the future , '' which it describes as an environmentally friendly boutique aimed at those 17 to 24 .
2007_01_15_1819026	7	NUMBERS THAT MATTER -- The week will bring snapshots of inflation , with the Producer Price Index for December ( Wednesday ) and the Consumer Price Index for December ( Thursday ) .
2007_01_15_1819026	8	Other reports include the Federal Reserve 's '' beige book '' of regional economic conditions as well as industrial production and capacity utilization for December ( Wednesday ) ; December housing starts and the Conference Board 's index of leading economic indicators ( Thursday ) ; and the University of Michigan 's consumer sentiment index ( Friday ) .
2007_01_15_1819026	9	MANY EARNINGS REPORTS -- Earnings season starts to pick up steam , primarily in technology and financial services industries .
2007_01_15_1819026	10	Among the companies reporting are Intel and Wells Fargo ( Tuesday ) ; Apple , JPMorgan Chase , Kinder Morgan , Mellon Financial , Northern Trust , Parker Hannifin , Southwest Airlines , State Street and Washington Mutual ( Wednesday ) ; Bank of New York , Capital One Financial , Harley-Davidson , Merrill Lynch , Novartis and UnitedHealth Group ( Thursday ) ; and Citigroup , General Electric and Motorola ( Friday ) .
2007_01_15_1819026	11	HOLIDAY SCHEDULE -- Financial markets are closed on Monday in observance of Martin Luther King 's Birthday .
2007_01_15_1819027	0	John Browne , chief executive of BP , will become chairman of the advisory board of the private equity firm Apax Partners when he leaves the oil company in July .
2007_01_15_1819027	1	Mr. Browne told BP executives on Friday of his plans , which would make him one of the biggest names in a new trend of globalism sweeping the private equity industry .
2007_01_15_1819027	2	His years presiding over an international company are likely to give a big boost to Apax 's expansion plans .
2007_01_15_1819027	3	American and European private equity companies have raised record amounts of money in recent years , and are increasingly looking overseas to areas like Asia and Latin America for new investments .
2007_01_15_1819027	4	Apax , which has invested more than $ 19 billion in its 30-year history , traditionally focused on the United States and Britain , and has expanded to include the rest of Europe in recent years .
2007_01_15_1819027	5	But the company 's aspirations are much more ambitious -- it opened an office in Hong Kong in 2005 and in Mumbai last year . ''
2007_01_15_1819027	6	As the private equity market matures , we believe that the best-performing firms will be those with genuine global reach and financial scale , '' Apax says on its Web site .
2007_01_15_1819027	7	In a report that the company put out in May , entitled '' Unlocking Global Value , '' Apax reviewed the private equity environment in 33 countries , and found that countries like Russia and Brazil had '' huge potential '' as they overcame complex regulatory structures and operating environments .
2007_01_15_1819027	8	BP has exploration projects in 26 countries from Angola to Canada , and production in 22 .
2007_01_15_1819027	9	Mr. Browne was instrumental in expanding the company 's global reach through a series of mergers , and setting up its Russian joint venture , TNK-BP .
2007_01_15_1819027	10	He is considered extremely well connected politically in a number of fast-growing developing nations .
2007_01_15_1819027	11	Apax 's rivals are also going global .
2007_01_15_1819027	12	Kohlberg , Kravis & Roberts Company made its first acquisition in India in April of last year .
2007_01_15_1819027	13	The Blackstone Group on Friday hired Hong Kong 's former financial secretary , Antony Leung , as chairman of its China business .
2007_01_15_1819027	14	A group of Western private equity investors have lined up to bid for Hutchinson 's Indian telecommunications operations , Hutchinson Essar , which , if successful , would be one of the largest deals ever in India .
2007_01_15_1819028	0	Older teenage girls are far more likely than younger girls , or boys of any age , to use social-networking sites like MySpace or Facebook , according to a recent study by the Pew Internet & American Life Project .
2007_01_15_1819028	1	The study found that , while older girls use such sites the most , older boys are more likely to meet new people through them .
2007_01_15_1819028	2	Sixty percent of older boys , for example , say they use the sites to make new friends , while only 46 percent of older girls do .
2007_01_15_1819028	3	And older boys are more than twice as likely to say they use the sites to flirt . ''
2007_01_15_1819028	4	Older boys are much more expansive in their use of the sites , '' said Amanda Lenhart , one of the study 's two authors . ''
2007_01_15_1819028	5	I believe that it has a lot to do with socialization .
2007_01_15_1819028	6	A lot of the media messages about safety tend to be aimed more at girls than boys . ''
2007_01_15_1819028	7	The study was conducted over a month last fall , through telephone interviews with households with minor children , who were identified from random calls over the last three years .
2007_01_15_1819028	8	The data was weighted to be nationally representative in terms of sex , age , education , race and other factors .
2007_01_15_1819029	0	A showdown is scheduled for a federal courtroom in Brooklyn tomorrow afternoon , where words like '' First Amendment '' and '' freedom of speech '' and '' prior restraint '' are likely to mix seamlessly with references to '' BitTorrent '' and '' Wiki . ''
2007_01_15_1819029	1	It is a messy plot that pits Eli Lilly , the pharmaceutical giant at the center of several articles in The New York Times suggesting that the company tried to hide or play down the health risks of its leading antipsychotic drug , Zyprexa , and lawyers representing various individuals , organizations and Web sites -- all arguing that their online speech has been gagged .
2007_01_15_1819029	2	The case has attracted the attention of the Electronic Frontier Foundation , the venerable digital rights group based in San Francisco , and one of its lawyers , Fred von Lohmann , who is now representing an anonymous Internet user caught up in the legal fracas . ''
2007_01_15_1819029	3	One of the core missions of the foundation 's 16-year history has been to establish that when you go online , you take with you all the same civil rights with you had with you in prior media , '' said Mr. von Lohmann . ''
2007_01_15_1819029	4	But of course , you need to fight for that principle . ''
2007_01_15_1819029	5	The quick background : It all began with Dr. David Egilman of Massachusetts , who was a consulting witness in ongoing litigation against Lilly .
2007_01_15_1819029	6	Dr. Egilman had in his possession a trove of internal Lilly documents -- not all of them flattering to the company -- sealed by the court as part of that litigation .
2007_01_15_1819029	7	Comes James B. Gottstein , a lawyer from Alaska , who was pursuing unrelated litigation for mentally ill patients in his state .
2007_01_15_1819029	8	He somehow got wind ( and precisely how is the subject of separate legal jujitsu ) that Dr. Egilman had some interesting documents .
2007_01_15_1819029	9	Mr. Gottstein sends Dr. Egilman a subpoena for copies .
2007_01_15_1819029	10	Hell begins breaking loose .
2007_01_15_1819029	11	In a letter dated Dec. 6 , Dr. Egilman informed Lilly 's lawyers , as was required by the order sealing the documents , that he had been subpoenaed .
2007_01_15_1819029	12	Lilly 's lawyers expressed their deep displeasure in a Dec. 14 letter to Mr. Gottstein , and politely told him to back off .
2007_01_15_1819029	13	In a response a day later , Mr. Gottstein informed them , among other things , that it was too late , and that some of the material had already been produced .
2007_01_15_1819029	14	It seems Mr. Gottstein was also apparently in a sharing mood , which is how hundreds of pages ended up with a Times reporter , Alex Berenson -- and about a dozen or so other individuals and organizations .
2007_01_15_1819029	15	This is also how copies of the documents ended up on various Web servers -- and when that happened , things changed .
2007_01_15_1819029	16	While surely painful for Lilly , the online proliferation began flirting with some bedrock principles of free speech and press , as well as some practical realities that looked a fair bit like toothpaste out of its tube .
2007_01_15_1819029	17	Nonetheless , last month , United States District Judge Jack B. Weinstein ordered Mr. Gottstein to provide a list of recipients to whom he had distributed the contraband pages , and to collect each copy back .
2007_01_15_1819029	18	The Times , which politely declined to oblige , has since been left out of the legal wrangling , but on Dec. 29 , the court temporarily enjoined an expansive list -- 14 named individuals , two health advocacy groups ( MindFreedom International and the Alliance for Human Research Protection ) , their Web sites , and a site devoted to the Zyprexa issue -- not just from '' further disseminating these documents . ''
2007_01_15_1819029	19	They were specifically ordered to communicate the injunction to anyone else who had copies , and enjoined from '' posting information to Web sites to facilitate dissemination of these documents . ''
2007_01_15_1819029	20	That 's right -- it appeared that even writing on their Web sites something like , '' Hey , there 's a site in Brazil where you can get those Zyprexa documents , '' would run afoul of the injunction .
2007_01_15_1819029	21	The order was extended by Judge Weinstein on Jan. 4 , and tomorrow the court will revisit the issue at length .
2007_01_15_1819029	22	As Mr. von Lohmann and the Electronic Frontier Foundation see it , the injunction is simply untenable .
2007_01_15_1819029	23	Whatever the legal merits of Lilly 's claims against Mr. Gottstein and Dr. Egilman for violating the seal , the court 's power to stifle the ever-growing chain of unrelated individuals and Web sites who , after one or two degrees of remove , had nothing to do with the Lilly litigation , can not extend to infinity .
2007_01_15_1819029	24	Very quickly , Mr. von Lohmann argues , you are dealing with ordinary citizens who are merely trading in and discussing documents of interest to public health . ''
2007_01_15_1819029	25	Judges have a natural inclination that if documents have been stolen under their watch , they want to get them back , '' said Mr. von Lohmann , whose John Doe client was a contributor to the site zyprexa.pbwiki.com -- a wiki where a hive of users compiled and contributed links and information relating to the Zyprexa case . ''
2007_01_15_1819029	26	But there are some limits to how many degrees of separation the court can reach . ''
2007_01_15_1819029	27	There is also a traditionally high bar set for placing prior restraint on the press -- which , whether Judge Weinstein recognizes it or not , very much includes a colony of citizen journalists feeding a wiki .
2007_01_15_1819029	28	Of course , the other , slightly more absurd side to all this is that attempting to stop the documents from spreading is , by now , a Sisyphean task . ''
2007_01_15_1819029	29	The court is trying to get the genie back into the bottle until it can sort out what 's going on through the course of litigation , which takes place at non-Internet speed , '' said Jonathan Zittrain , a professor of Internet governance and regulation at Oxford and a founder of the Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard Law School . ''
2007_01_15_1819029	30	Perhaps the court thinks that whoever is adding to the wiki is among the parties to the original case , '' Professor Zittrain said . ''
2007_01_15_1819029	31	That 's understandable , but it puts the court in a no-win situation .
2007_01_15_1819029	32	It 's left issuing an order that sounds like no one in the world is allowed to post the documents . ''
2007_01_15_1819029	33	For its part , even The Times , which often posts original documents for its readers , tried to put the things online when Mr. Berenson wrote his first article , but the raw pages -- more than 350 individual image files weighing in at over 500 megabytes -- proved unwieldy .
2007_01_15_1819029	34	George H. Freeman , vice president and general counsel for The Times , said , '' The Times fulfilled its role by doing a lot of research and then highlighting and including the most important issues and documents in a series of well-placed news articles . ''
2007_01_15_1819029	35	For now , copies of the Lilly documents sit defiantly on servers in Sweden , and under a domain registered at Christmas Island , the Australian dot in the ocean 224 miles off the coast of Java . ''
2007_01_15_1819029	36	Proudly served from outside the United States , '' the site declares .
2007_01_15_1819029	37	There are surely others .
2007_01_15_1819029	38	On his TortsProf blog ( snipurl.com/Torts ) , William G. Childs , an assistant professor at Western New England School of Law in Springfield , Mass. , put it this way in a headline : '' Judge Tries to Unring Bell Hanging Around Neck of Horse Already Out of Barn Being Carried on Ship That Has Sailed .

2007_01_15_1819030	0	A San Francisco talk radio station pre-empted three hours of programming on Friday in response to a campaign by bloggers who have recorded extreme comments by several hosts and passed on digital copies to advertisers .
2007_01_15_1819030	1	The lead blogger , who uses the name Spocko , said that he and other bloggers had contacted more than 30 advertisers on KSFO-AM to inform them of comments made on the air and to ask them to pull their ads .
2007_01_15_1819030	2	The comments were also posted on Spocko 's Web site , spockosbrain.com .
2007_01_15_1819030	3	In response , ABC Radio Networks , which owns KSFO and which in turn is owned by the Walt Disney Company , sent letters to the site 's service provider , demanding the clips be taken down from its servers .
2007_01_15_1819030	4	The provider complied , raising the issue of what constitutes fair use of copyrighted material by a critic .
2007_01_15_1819030	5	In an unusual cap to a simmering controversy , four talk radio hosts at KSFO-AM themselves played the clips on Friday , which had , in some cases , drawn national attention for language considered racially insensitive , religiously intolerant or containing violent imagery .
2007_01_15_1819030	6	The broadcast contained the occasional carefully measured apology for language that '' could have been put more elegantly , '' as one host , Melanie Morgan , described her comment -- '' We 've got a bull 's eye painted on her big wide laughing eyes '' -- about Nancy Pelosi , the Democratic speaker of the House of Representatives , who is from San Francisco . ''
2007_01_15_1819030	7	But Ms. Morgan added that her words were obviously a political metaphor that had to be distorted by critics to appear violent .
2007_01_15_1819030	8	Ms. Morgan said that the on-air talent had '' been reissued guidelines from the company about violent rhetoric and we 've reviewed those rules and we do n't believe that we have crossed any single line . ''
2007_01_15_1819030	9	But the hosts were uniformly defiant against the bloggers , who were called '' crackpots with keyboards '' and accused of using '' guerrilla tactics . ''
2007_01_15_1819030	10	Spocko had recorded and disseminated other clips from the station in an effort to alarm advertisers .
2007_01_15_1819030	11	In one , Brian Sussman , an evening host on KSFO , described Senator Barack Obama , Democrat of Illinois , as a '' halfrican , '' because he has one African parent and one white parent .
2007_01_15_1819030	12	In another , from 2005 , he challenged a caller who said he was not a Muslim to prove it by repeating back an insult to Allah .
2007_01_15_1819030	13	Mr. Sussman apologized for both comments during Friday 's three-hour show .
2007_01_15_1819030	14	In an interview , Spocko , who described himself as being in his '' late 40s and a communications professional , '' said he was appalled by what he heard on KSFO .
2007_01_15_1819030	15	Among the advertisers Spocko contacted , and who have been reported in The San Francisco Chronicle to have stopped advertising at KSFO were Bank of America , MasterCard and the Michigan Economic Development Corporation .
2007_01_15_1819030	16	During the Friday show , one of the hosts , Lee Rodgers , read an e-mail message asking if the station had lost any sponsors so the listener could , in turn , boycott the former sponsors .
2007_01_15_1819030	17	Ms. Morgan said '' one advertiser -- exactly one '' had left the station .
2007_01_15_1819030	18	When reached at his office , KSFO-AM 's program director , Ken Berry , said he felt '' the three-hour broadcast best spoke for us '' and referred other questions to ABC .
2007_01_15_1819030	19	An ABC spokeswoman had no comment .
2007_01_15_1819030	20	Spocko 's campaign became more widely followed when his blog was taken down by his Internet service provider , 1 & 1 Internet , of Chesterbrook , Pa. , after ABC lawyers sent the company a cease and desist letter on Dec. 22 .
2007_01_15_1819030	21	1 & 1 says '' the decision was made to remove the copyrighted material from our servers until the matter is resolved , whether by the parties involved or the judicial system . ''
2007_01_15_1819030	22	Spocko has since switched to a different Web hosting company .
2007_01_15_1819030	23	His lawyer , Matt Zimmerman of the Electronic Frontier Foundation , a nonprofit digital rights group based in San Francisco , says that 1 & 1 acted too quickly in response to the ABC letter , which he described as saber-rattling rather than a valid notice under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act , an updating of copyright laws from 1998 . ''
2007_01_15_1819030	24	They have a choice when they get these vague threats , '' said Mr. Zimmerman , who argued that Spocko 's clips constituted fair use . ''
2007_01_15_1819030	25	They can instantly shut it down '' or wait until formally notified of copyright infringement as detailed in the act .
2007_01_15_1819030	26	A spokesman for 1 & 1 , Neil Simpkins , said the company was acting on the advice of its lawyers and noted that the material '' is being distributed all over the Internet . ''
2007_01_15_1819030	27	He said that to his knowledge the company had never before taken down a site because of copyright concerns .
2007_01_15_1819030	28	Rebecca Jeschke , a spokeswoman for the the foundation , said ABC 's actions would have a chilling effect on online debate .
2007_01_15_1819030	29	Most of the callers were sympathetic during Friday 's broadcast , but one blogger who has supported Spocko 's cause , Mike Stark , was encouraged to call in .
2007_01_15_1819030	30	The extended dialogue perhaps can best be summarized by one exchange .
2007_01_15_1819030	31	Mr. Stark : '' You 've spoken of the number of apologies you have tried to make .
2007_01_15_1819030	32	How many apologies does a professional get before they realize they are an incompetent and move on to another line of work ? ''
2007_01_15_1819030	33	KSFO 's Lee Rodgers : '' Well I have n't apologized for anything and I am not going to start with you .
2007_01_15_1819030	34	How the hell do you like that , creep ? ''
2007_01_15_1819031	0	Leonard J. Asper is part of the best-known family in the Canadian media and one of its most aggressive .
2007_01_15_1819031	1	But have the Aspers picked one fight too many ?
2007_01_15_1819031	2	Mr. Asper , chief executive of CanWest Global Communications , a leading broadcaster and newspaper publisher , has just concluded a 2.3 billion Canadian dollar deal ( $ 1.97 billion ) for Alliance Atlantis Communications , best known in the United States as the creator of '' CSI : Crime Scene Investigation '' and in Canada for its lucrative specialty cable channels .
2007_01_15_1819031	3	But CanWest is still struggling with the debt it took on when it bought the largest Canadian newspaper chain from a company then controlled by Conrad M. Black .
2007_01_15_1819031	4	Like many buyers these days , Mr. Asper used private equity capital .
2007_01_15_1819031	5	But by relying on money from Goldman Sachs , the prominent American-based investment bank , for the bulk of the deal announced on Wednesday , Mr. Asper is directly challenging Canadian laws banning the foreign control of broadcasters . ''
2007_01_15_1819031	6	There 's concern that Goldman might be trying to rent our passport for this purchase , '' Mr. Asper said during an interview on Friday . ''
2007_01_15_1819031	7	It 's just the opposite .
2007_01_15_1819031	8	We 're renting their equity . ''
2007_01_15_1819031	9	Canada 's foreign ownership rules are complex .
2007_01_15_1819031	10	The key for CanWest will be to demonstrate that Goldman Sachs will not have any effective control over major decisions related to the 13 Alliance Atlantis channels .
2007_01_15_1819031	11	That may be tough .
2007_01_15_1819031	12	While no one disputes that Global will operate the channels , it will provide only about 132 million Canadian dollars of the 2.3 billion Canadian dollar purchase and will receive 17 percent of the equity .
2007_01_15_1819031	13	Mr. Asper maintains that the deal is straightforward . ''
2007_01_15_1819031	14	This is really a three-stage purchase in installments , '' he said , concluding in a plan by CanWest to buy out the Goldman Sachs interest down the road .
2007_01_15_1819031	15	But others say the deal will not pass muster with regulators . ''
2007_01_15_1819031	16	There 's something between a possibility and an absolute probability that the deal wo n't fly , '' said Ian Morrison , spokesman for the Friends of Canadian Broadcasting , which lobbies for Canadian programming . ''
2007_01_15_1819031	17	All this deal may do is establish a market price for Alliance Atlantis . ''
2007_01_15_1819031	18	The Aspers have had their run-ins with regulators over the years , but have mainly benefited from the limitations that the government in Ottawa puts on foreign ownership .
2007_01_15_1819031	19	When CanWest 's Global Television , like any private broadcaster , buys the rights to an American show , Global 's signal dislodges the host American network 's feed when that program goes on the air . ''
2007_01_15_1819031	20	The easiest and simplest way to make money in Canadian broadcasting is by airing American programming , '' said Marc Raboy , a professor of communications and media at McGill University in Montreal . ''
2007_01_15_1819031	21	It 's a no-brainer : American content is cheaper than producing Canadian content . ''
2007_01_15_1819031	22	In 1974 , Mr. Asper 's father , Israel H. Asper ( known to everyone as Izzy ) was the leader of the Liberal Party of Manitoba and an owner of an independent television station in Winnipeg , when he joined a group to rescue Global , then an audaciously named , but financially challenged station , in Toronto .
2007_01_15_1819031	23	When joined with a string of independent stations that CanWest owned , Global evolved into a network .
2007_01_15_1819031	24	It also came under fire frequently for producing as little Canadian programming as rules permitted . ''
2007_01_15_1819031	25	They have a very slender record in that area , '' Mr. Morrison said .
2007_01_15_1819031	26	The elder Mr. Asper died in 2003 , three years after buying the newspaper chain from Mr. Black ( a purchase that is at the center of Mr. Black 's planned trial in Chicago ) .
2007_01_15_1819031	27	Since then , Global has also gone from Canada 's most profitable private broadcaster to one that trails the rival CTVglobemedia .
2007_01_15_1819031	28	In 2001 , CanWest 's broadcast outlets had operating profit margins of 33 percent ; last year , that had dropped to 5 percent .
2007_01_15_1819031	29	The company 's media assets , though concentrated in Canada , include properties in Australia , New Zealand , Britain and Ireland .
2007_01_15_1819031	30	Another problem for Global has been a gradual shift by viewers in Canada , as is the case in the United States , away from traditional networks and toward specialty cable channels , where the company is weak .
2007_01_15_1819031	31	Indeed , Mr. Asper blames regulators for much his weakness in the cable TV business .
2007_01_15_1819031	32	Alliance Atlantis , primarily a film producer at the time , was given channels and Global was shut out in an attempt to diversify ownership in the broadcasting industry .
2007_01_15_1819031	33	He acknowledged that Global 's methods did not help . ''
2007_01_15_1819031	34	It 's also true that we were a victim of our business planning , '' he said , '' because in a couple of cases , we did not put the same Canadian content commitment in our license applications as others . ''
2007_01_15_1819031	35	Mr. Asper will be back before the same regulator later this year looking for approval on last week 's deal .
2007_01_15_1819031	36	Another issue will be the deal 's complexity .
2007_01_15_1819031	37	Among other things , the ultimate size of CanWest 's equity holding will become clear only in 2011 , when the channels acquired merge into Global . ''
2007_01_15_1819031	38	The deal is quite convoluted , and details remain surprisingly sparse , '' Robert Bek , a media analyst with CIBC World Markets , wrote in an investors ' note last week .
2007_01_15_1819031	39	Professor Raboy also anticipates that CanWest will have a difficult time persuading the regulator that Goldman Sachs will not have a large influence , particularly given CanWest 's heavy debt . ''
2007_01_15_1819031	40	It will be asking if , in financial terms , CanWest is strong enough to sustain a deal like this , '' he said .
2007_01_15_1819035	0	The recent layoffs at the embattled Philadelphia Inquirer have resulted in a round of finger-pointing over their disproportionate impact on diversity in the newsroom .
2007_01_15_1819035	1	On Jan. 3 , the Inquirer began laying off 71 newsroom employees , or 17 percent of its staff , based on seniority guidelines in the newspaper union 's contract .
2007_01_15_1819035	2	According to the Newspaper Guild of Greater Philadelphia , 17 of the 71 journalists laid off , or about 24 percent , are minorities .
2007_01_15_1819035	3	In a Jan. 3 letter to Brian P. Tierney , the publisher of The Inquirer and The Daily News , the National Association of Black Journalists protested the sharp decline in newsroom diversity .
2007_01_15_1819035	4	Mr. Tierney and union leaders expressed dismay at the impact on newsroom diversity -- and promptly blamed each other .
2007_01_15_1819035	5	Mr. Tierney responded to the black journalists ' association in a Jan. 5 letter , saying that he had repeatedly attempted to change the seniority system in order to consider diversity in the course of staff cuts .
2007_01_15_1819035	6	But , he said , the guild 's insistence on maintaining that system tied his hands .
2007_01_15_1819035	7	The union responded with a bulletin on Wednesday , defending the seniority system and noting that the paper had managed to partially circumvent that system with '' carveouts '' of certain beats , to protect some reporters with specialized knowledge . ''
2007_01_15_1819035	8	It 's a serious moral issue .
2007_01_15_1819035	9	We must maintain the diversity of the newsroom , '' said Henry J. Holcomb , the president of the Newspaper Guild of Greater Philadelphia .
2007_01_15_1819035	10	He said that if the paper were willing to offer buyouts to senior employees , the paper could call back several junior African-American reporters .
2007_01_15_1819035	11	Mr. Tierney said that while he was committed to maintaining diversity , he was financially unable to offer buyouts . ''
2007_01_15_1819035	12	If we offer buyouts on top of severance , then I 'm going to have to lay off more people .
2007_01_15_1819035	13	That would not be fair to anybody , '' he said in a telephone interview .
2007_01_15_1819035	14	Bryan Monroe , the president of the black journalists ' group , expressed frustration with both the union and the paper . ''
2007_01_15_1819035	15	They both agree that this is wrong , '' he said . ''
2007_01_15_1819035	16	If they ca n't do something about this , who can ?
2007_01_15_1819035	17	Get out of the blame game and fix the problem . ''
2007_01_15_1819036	0	New England 's fickle weather has been the subject of many jokes , and it seemed to be playing one last week on Yankee magazine , the longtime chronicler of all things quaint and folksy in the region .
2007_01_15_1819036	1	Yankee introduced a new format in its latest issue , which arrived on newsstands Jan. 9 with a big cover story about the glories of snow .
2007_01_15_1819036	2	The wintry scene depicted was all the more prominent because the magazine , which shrank to digest size during World War II to conserve paper , had grown to full size .
2007_01_15_1819036	3	But New England has been outright warm this winter , along with most of the Northeast .
2007_01_15_1819036	4	It was a record 67 degrees on Jan. 6 in Portland , Me. , for example , and even the snowiest parts of northern Maine , Vermont and New Hampshire have seen relatively little of the stuff , according to the National Weather Service .
2007_01_15_1819036	5	In a telephone interview Thursday , Mel Allen , the recently named editor of Yankee , pre-empted the question . ''
2007_01_15_1819036	6	You 're going to kid with me about not having any snow , '' he said .
2007_01_15_1819036	7	The cover photo and story package were selected last summer , Mr. Allen said . ''
2007_01_15_1819036	8	Who would have suggested Jan. 11 we would n't have had a significant snowfall yet ? ''
2007_01_15_1819036	9	The current Yankee was the January/February issue , he pointed out , adding that there was still time for plenty of blizzards . ''
2007_01_15_1819036	10	I 'm betting that we 're going to get socked , '' he said .
2007_01_15_1819036	11	Still , at a recent planning meeting for next year 's winter issue , some story ideas were rejiggered to be mindful of the fact that the winter of 2008 could be mild , too , Mr. Allen said .
2007_01_15_1819036	12	As for readers , Yankee has been swamped by letters , phone calls and e-mail messages -- the vast majority of them about the publication 's new format . ''
2007_01_15_1819036	13	Yankee has been passed down like an heirloom from generation to generation , and it 's always had this idiosyncratic size , '' Mr. Allen said .
2007_01_15_1819036	14	Yankee was n't the only magazine to introduce design changes this month and trip slightly over long lead times .
2007_01_15_1819036	15	The Atlantic -- which , like Yankee , is placing new emphasis on photography -- ran a calendar item noting that Saddam Hussein might hang in February ( it happened in late December ) .
2007_01_15_1819036	16	James Bennet , editor of The Atlantic , said by telephone Friday , '' There is a degree of prophecy that 's involved in this kind of work . ''
2007_01_15_1819036	17	JENNIFER A. KINGSON MEDIA TALK
2007_01_15_1819037	0	ABC sees fewer ongoing , serialized dramas in its future , and at least one of its biggest shows -- the megahit '' Lost '' -- is heading toward a definite end .
2007_01_15_1819037	1	Stephen McPherson , the president of ABC Entertainment , told a meeting of television writers here on Sunday that after the experience of several failed or mediocre new serials this year -- including '' Day Break , '' '' The Nine '' and '' Six Degrees '' -- the network has fewer of those types of shows in development .
2007_01_15_1819037	2	And for '' Lost , '' the biggest of the ABC serials , the network is now discussing with the producers how and when to end the series , Mr. McPherson said .
2007_01_15_1819037	3	Damon Lindelof , one of the executive producers of '' Lost , '' said that the show 's creators had always viewed it as lasting about 100 episodes , and that he still believes that will be the case .
2007_01_15_1819037	4	Fifty-three episodes have been broadcast so far , with the show in its third season , meaning that it is likely that the fifth season will be the last . ''
2007_01_15_1819037	5	We 're no longer going up the hill , '' Mr. Lindelof said . ''
2007_01_15_1819037	6	We 're starting to come down now . ''
2007_01_15_1819037	7	Mr. Lindelof also said that while ABC has the ability to extend the series as long as it wants , with different producers and even different stars , he believes that the network is unlikely to do so . ''
2007_01_15_1819037	8	We do n't want to produce those episodes of ` Lost , ' and we are not going to , '' Mr. Lindelof said .
2007_01_15_1819037	9	He cautioned against such a move , pointing out that as series like '' The X-Files '' and '' Alias '' extended their runs by making dubious creative decisions , their ratings suffered greatly as fans abandoned the shows in droves .
2007_01_15_1819037	10	He said the network and the producers would announce the decision soon after it is made , to make sure that fans understand that the show has a definite endpoint , and that outstanding questions about the mysteries of the island will be answered .
2007_01_15_1819037	11	But there also was some good news for '' Lost '' fans .
2007_01_15_1819037	12	Mr. McPherson said it is unlikely that viewers will have to weather another extended midseason hiatus .
2007_01_15_1819037	13	The network has been criticized by fans for running six '' Lost '' episodes last fall , then breaking for almost three months before resuming the series next month for 16 straight weeks .
2007_01_15_1819037	14	Mr. McPherson said he believes that the next season will run for 22 consecutive weeks , either in the fall of 2007 or the spring of 2008 .
2007_01_15_1819037	15	Production requirements and scheduling necessities caused ABC to break up the series this season , he said .
2007_01_15_1819037	16	ABC also said it will present a fourth season of '' Dancing With the Stars , '' its hit ballroom-dance competition , on Monday nights beginning on March 19 .
2007_01_15_1819037	17	The network decided not to schedule the competition installments of the series directly against '' American Idol , '' which runs on Tuesday nights , although the results show for '' Dancing '' will be seen at 9 p.m. on Tuesday , going up against at least a portion of '' Idol '' on some nights .
2007_01_15_1819037	18	As for future serial shows Mr. McPherson said that the experience of the network 's current season , with several bad showings for new serials , indicated that audiences have a limited ability to absorb such shows .
2007_01_15_1819037	19	After the initial success of '' Lost '' and Fox 's '' 24 '' several years ago , a lot of television production companies put new serials into development , with many of them on at the same time , as they did this year . ''
2007_01_15_1819037	20	We 're going to see an adjustment this year because people in the fall were able to see whether or not there was a burnout , '' Mr. McPherson said . ''
2007_01_15_1819037	21	We 're seeing a little bit of a shift away from that . ''
2007_01_15_1819038	0	In the Senior Pairs at the Edgar Kaplan Winter Regional in Midtown Manhattan on Dec. 27 , Augie Boehm and Seymour Reich of New York finished first , ahead of Al Pagan of Hackensack , N.J. , and Martin Weiss of Fort Lee , N.J. ; and Michael Kallman and Jean Ludwig of New York .
2007_01_15_1819038	1	The winners did well on the diagramed deal .
2007_01_15_1819038	2	West opened one heart in the modern style .
2007_01_15_1819038	3	( When you are thinking of opening with minimum values , consider two things : Are you going to bid a suit that you are happy for partner to lead at trick one , in particular if he holds king-doubleton ; and do you have a comfortable rebid whatever partner responds ?
2007_01_15_1819038	4	This hand answers positively to these questions . )
2007_01_15_1819038	5	East 's decision to pass is strange .
2007_01_15_1819038	6	With three-card heart support and a singleton , it would seem normal to raise to two hearts .
2007_01_15_1819038	7	If you had been South , what would you have done now ?
2007_01_15_1819038	8	You could jump to four spades or to three no-trump , trusting partner to have a few useful goodies .
2007_01_15_1819038	9	But Boehm decided to double , keeping his options open and hoping to learn something beneficial for the play .
2007_01_15_1819038	10	Surprise , surprise : West passed , and partner advanced one spade .
2007_01_15_1819038	11	Now , not wanting a heart lead straight through his king-jack , South felt endplayed into bidding three no-trump .
2007_01_15_1819038	12	Boehm might also have been influenced by his own workmanlike book , '' Three Notrump in Depth '' ( HNB Publishing , 2006 ) .
2007_01_15_1819038	13	In it he discusses the bidding , declarer play and defense of our favorite contract .
2007_01_15_1819038	14	Notice that four spades , even when played by South , should lose four tricks : two hearts , one diamond and one club .
2007_01_15_1819038	15	If West had led fourth-highest from his longest and strongest , he would have defeated three no-trump .
2007_01_15_1819038	16	But he tried a sneak attack , selecting the club six .
2007_01_15_1819038	17	Declarer won with his jack and played the diamond king .
2007_01_15_1819038	18	To keep South to his contract , East had to hold up his ace , but understandably he did not , so Boehm took 10 tricks ( six spades , two diamonds and two clubs ) for a shared top .

2007_01_15_1819039	1	After an early career bright with promise ( and with titles like '' Island of the Sequined Love Nun '' ) , Christopher Moore wandered onto the swampier terrain of zonked-out comic horror .
2007_01_15_1819039	2	This has become his specialty , and he delivers it with wildly varying degrees of finesse .
2007_01_15_1819039	3	His last book , '' A Dirty Job , '' was one of his iffier amalgams , dealing with death merchants , a motherless child and strange little squirrel people .
2007_01_15_1819039	4	Now Mr. Moore is back on track with a vampire comedy and an instant joke : it 's called '' You Suck , '' so publications that otherwise avoid that phrase have to print its title .
2007_01_15_1819039	5	The title needs mentioning because the book will be too popular to be ignored . ''
2007_01_15_1819039	6	You Suck '' is funny enough to reanimate Mr. Moore 's fans , at least those who wondered about the last book 's squirrel types .
2007_01_15_1819039	7	It 's sure to appeal to anyone who shares the author 's ideas of a fun-loving vampire 's priorities .
2007_01_15_1819039	8	Among these : using self-tanning lotion to avoid a deathly pallor ( '' I think the pale thing is giving me away '' ) , anointing a cute little goth minion ( '' What do we need an onion for ? '' )
2007_01_15_1819039	9	and redyeing vampire vestments to avoid embarrassment .
2007_01_15_1819039	10	Even worse than being caught in daylight is the mortification , by Mr. Moore 's nocturnal lights , of wearing black clothes so overwashed that they start to look gray . ''
2007_01_15_1819039	11	You Suck '' is a sequel .
2007_01_15_1819039	12	This does not bode well for a cult author who writes fast and already recycles favorite gags and characters .
2007_01_15_1819039	13	But it 's a follow-up to '' Bloodsucking Fiends , '' which came out in 1995 , before Mr. Moore 's reputation for riotous humor was fully established .
2007_01_15_1819039	14	A decent interval has gone by , so that this story 's adolescent hero , C. Thomas Flood , seems fresh again .
2007_01_15_1819039	15	For one thing the new book 's jacket mysteriously calls him Thomas C. Flood .
2007_01_15_1819039	16	Also , Tommy has been through big changes since that earlier story .
2007_01_15_1819039	17	He used to be alive , but now he 's sort of dead .
2007_01_15_1819039	18	The title reflects Tommy 's dismay at discovering that last fact .
2007_01_15_1819039	19	He blames Jody , the beautiful redheaded vampire who bit him ( '' I wanted us to be together , '' she tries to explain ) and has given him a whole new set of problems .
2007_01_15_1819039	20	Once Tommy worked at a supermarket and devoted himself to pursuits like bowling with frozen turkeys .
2007_01_15_1819039	21	Now he must puzzle over the vampire 's bodily functions ( or lack thereof ) , dawn curfew , tendency to lisp because of those '' fangth '' and wardrobe issues .
2007_01_15_1819039	22	Wearing a flannel shirt at a nightclub , Tommy winds up looking '' like he 'd shown up at the sacrificial mass of the damned ready to fix the dishwasher . ''
2007_01_15_1819039	23	Although constructing plots is as much of a nuisance for Mr. Moore as it is a necessity , '' You Suck '' puts Tommy and Jody in the midst of nicely crazed company .
2007_01_15_1819039	24	The book 's funniest voice is that of the minion , who calls herself Abby Normal . ''
2007_01_15_1819039	25	Allison is my day-slave name -- my mom named me after some song by some Elvis guy , so I totally refuse to accept it , '' Abby writes in her journal , which is one long hoot , as she exults in the honor of being able to treat Tommy as her boss and mentor . ''
2007_01_15_1819039	26	He is called the vampyre Flood , '' she writes , '' and he did n't say , but I think he is descended from European royalty -- a viscount or a discount or one of those . ''
2007_01_15_1819039	27	Though Abby whimpers that her life is dull ( '' the time passes like a seeping infection on a bad eyebrow piercing '' ) , things pick up considerably when she begins doing the bidding of Tommy and Jody .
2007_01_15_1819039	28	Abby and her boyfriend , Jared ( '' And Jared was all , ` Whoa ' '' ) , even wrap and duct-tape the vampires for daytime transport and are caught by the police loading two mummylike objects into a minivan .
2007_01_15_1819039	29	Abby 's version of this incident illustrates some of Mr. Moore 's best ventriloquism for a teenage girl : '' And they 're all , ` So , what are you doing with your piercings and your magenta-on-black hair , and what can we do to further repress your creativity ?
2007_01_15_1819039	30	Because '' You Suck '' vacillates between goth gags and actual blood-guzzling , it ought to be a tricky balancing act for Mr. Moore .
2007_01_15_1819039	31	But he glides comfortably through the book 's loony little corner of San Francisco and through drastic changes of mood .
2007_01_15_1819039	32	He also manages , despite figures like a blue-painted prostitute who prompts visions of sex with a Smurf , to keep the book 's eccentricity in check and its screwball antics from becoming insufferable .
2007_01_15_1819039	33	As with his best work , there 's a fundamental sweetness beneath the antics .
2007_01_15_1819039	34	And the characters are developed with real affection .
2007_01_15_1819039	35	That most of them are dead is never allowed to seem sad .
2007_01_15_1819039	36	And for parasitical bloodsuckers , they do remarkably little harm .
2007_01_15_1819039	37	Mr. Moore 's comic ravings manage to mix drastically incongruous elements of ordinary life , which is no small part of their appeal .
2007_01_15_1819039	38	When some of the book 's characters need to masquerade as hip-hop tough guys , they go to Google to find an otherwise-unused gang color ( orange ) and then try out ridiculous orange-sounding names .
2007_01_15_1819039	39	( '' Yo , Stone Tangerine Thugs , yo . '' ''
2007_01_15_1819039	40	Cheesy Goldfish Crew . '' )
2007_01_15_1819039	41	When Abby perfects what she calls '' my Nosferatitude '' by resorting to a liquid diet , Starbucks provides the liquids of choice .
2007_01_15_1819039	42	And when the book 's stoner , '' Ohm-budsman , '' has his fateful encounter with a vampire , it 's Christmas night .
2007_01_15_1819039	43	He is sitting in his living room in sunglasses , surrounded by five-foot-tall illicit potted plants , '' watching a movie on cable about the special relationship between the lady of an English manor and her chimney sweep . ''
2007_01_15_1819039	44	In Mr. Moore 's universe this is a perfect holiday celebration .
2007_01_15_1819040	0	Bill Moyers will again have a regular presence on PBS on a Friday-night public-affairs series , while the documentarian Ken Burns , 53 , has agreed to work for the public broadcaster for 15 more years , the network announced on Saturday .
2007_01_15_1819040	1	It also revealed the slate for its '' America at a Crossroads '' series of documentaries , scheduled for April .
2007_01_15_1819040	2	Mr. Moyers , 72 , has appeared only occasionally on PBS since stepping down in 2004 from his previous program , '' Now With Bill Moyers . ''
2007_01_15_1819040	3	That program , which continued without him , became a flashpoint in the Corporation for Public Broadcasting 's debate with PBS over whether PBS programming was politically balanced .
2007_01_15_1819040	4	The first episode of '' Bill Moyers Journal '' -- the same name of his series in the 1970s -- which was announced on Saturday and begins in April , will examine the role of the press prior to the Iraq invasion .
2007_01_15_1819040	5	Mr. Burns 's 14-hour program on World War II will be broadcast in September .
2007_01_15_1819040	6	PBS also unveiled the titles of 9 of the 11 documentaries that will make up its weeklong '' America at a Crossroads '' series in April , examining challenges confronting the United States since Sept. 11 .
2007_01_15_1819040	7	Among the filmmakers was an unusual name : Karl Zinsmeister , the chief domestic policy adviser to President Bush and a producer , with his wife Ann , of '' Warriors , '' a close-up portrait of the daily life of United States Army soldiers in Iraq .
2007_01_15_1819040	8	The documentary was written and directed by Ed Robbins .
2007_01_15_1819040	9	The Corporation for Public Broadcasting initially financed '' Warriors '' when Mr. Zinsmeister , who has defended the war in Iraq in books and magazine articles , was the longtime editor in chief of The American Enterprise magazine .
2007_01_15_1819040	10	When he was named to the White House position last May , '' he recused himself '' from completing the documentary , said Jeff Bieber , one of the series 's executive producers .
2007_01_15_1819040	11	Other films that made the cut include a portrait of Richard N. Perle , the former Bush administration adviser and Iraq war advocate , who narrates a documentary in which he confronts his critics , as well as a '' Frontline '' co-production that takes a critical look at the effort to train Iraqi forces ; a profile of the Muslim dissident Irshad Manji ; and an examination of Islam in Indonesia , produced by New York Times Television .
2007_01_15_1819044	0	Willie Nelson was halfway through a flinty and casually gripping guitar solo on '' Rainy Day Blues '' when everything clicked into place .
2007_01_15_1819044	1	It was his fifth song at the Allen Room on Friday night , and the bright young rhythm section onstage was finally locking in .
2007_01_15_1819044	2	At Mr. Nelson 's right elbow Wynton Marsalis shot the saxophonist Walter Blanding Jr. a knowing glance , one eyebrow appreciatively raised .
2007_01_15_1819044	3	After a somewhat tentative start , the concert hit its groove .
2007_01_15_1819044	4	Mr. Nelson was performing with Mr. Marsalis 's quintet in the first of four sold-out shows organized by Jazz at Lincoln Center , under the heading '' Willie Nelson Sings the Blues . ''
2007_01_15_1819044	5	( It was a sequel to a brief encounter several years ago when he played on a gala for the organization . )
2007_01_15_1819044	6	Because the blues are as much of a bedrock for Mr. Nelson as they are for Mr. Marsalis , this held the simple promise of a meeting on common ground .
2007_01_15_1819044	7	All Mr. Nelson brought with him was an acoustic guitar and a trusted wingman , the harmonica player Mickey Raphael .
2007_01_15_1819044	8	He also brought his intractable style , which posed more of a challenge to the other musicians than any clash of genre .
2007_01_15_1819044	9	His conversational way with rhythm , in particular , momentarily threw the band .
2007_01_15_1819044	10	During a series of stop-time breaks on '' Basin Street Blues , '' the second tune , Mr. Nelson 's phrasing was almost perversely free of tempo , rustling like a breeze .
2007_01_15_1819044	11	In much the same way , he seemed to regard the jump-blues thrust of '' Caldonia '' as merely a recommendation , something to heed at will .
2007_01_15_1819044	12	And that , as his fans might say , is typical Willie .
2007_01_15_1819044	13	Though he has had one of the broadest careers in American music , Mr. Nelson is no chameleon .
2007_01_15_1819044	14	His colors are the same in any setting ; and the calm , comforting tone of his voice rarely warps or strains to fit a fashion . ''
2007_01_15_1819044	15	Rainy Day Blues '' happens to be the first track on his current album , '' Songbird '' ( Lost Highway ) , which features anthems by the likes of Leonard Cohen and Fleetwood Mac .
2007_01_15_1819044	16	Though not on his usual turf , Mr. Nelson sounds entirely unfazed , and unchanged .
2007_01_15_1819044	17	Because that was true on Friday too , the onus of adapting rested on the pianist Dan Nimmer , the bassist Carlos Henriquez and the drummer Ali Jackson .
2007_01_15_1819044	18	They handled it professionally , attuning themselves to Mr. Nelson 's drifting cadences with an increasing understanding and command .
2007_01_15_1819044	19	There was no such learning curve for Mr. Marsalis , who played his trumpet with terse , unforced authority right out of the gate .
2007_01_15_1819044	20	He tinkered a fair amount with timbre throughout the concert , using an array of different mutes and techniques .
2007_01_15_1819044	21	He was pushing toward a vocal quality , singing through his horn .
2007_01_15_1819044	22	Mr. Marsalis also sang with his voice , on a version of '' Ai n't Nobody 's Business '' that quickly turned into a buddy duet . ''
2007_01_15_1819044	23	I hear you , '' Mr. Nelson said sympathetically during a roguish verse by Mr. Marsalis .
2007_01_15_1819044	24	It was a moment evocative of the banter between Jack Teagarden and Louis Armstrong .
2007_01_15_1819044	25	And it set a playful tone for what followed , including renditions of '' My Bucket 's Got a Hole In It '' and '' Down by the Riverside . ''
2007_01_15_1819044	26	But the concert 's most transcendent moments conveyed more of a quiet ache .
2007_01_15_1819044	27	They were '' Stardust '' and '' Georgia on My Mind , '' a pair of Hoagy Carmichael standards that Mr. Nelson long ago personalized .
2007_01_15_1819044	28	He sang them both with a forthright intimacy , as if telling a cherished bedtime story .
2007_01_15_1819044	29	And the band was right there with him , emphasizing how the blues are as much a feeling as a form .
2007_01_15_1819045	0	Citigroup , the global banking giant , is shrinking -- but only its name .
2007_01_15_1819045	1	Executives are prepared to rebrand the company '' Citi '' and to fold up its familiar red umbrella and instead use a logo with a stylized arc above the name .
2007_01_15_1819045	2	The new name and look , which follows a 14-month review of the bank 's brand , will be presented to the Citigroup board this week , according to several executives close to the process .
2007_01_15_1819045	3	No final decision has been made and it could still undergo some minor changes . ''
2007_01_15_1819045	4	We continue to work on our branding effort and will announce our decisions when it is completed , '' a spokeswoman , Leah Johnson , said .
2007_01_15_1819045	5	If adopted , the revised Citi brand and logo will be used at nearly all the vast financial services company 's businesses , including retail branches and its investment bank concentrated in the New York area , and showcased around the world .
2007_01_15_1819045	6	The design is similar to the '' citi '' logo that now appears on much of its consumer advertising , office buildings and credit cards .
2007_01_15_1819045	7	A rollout could begin as early as next month .
2007_01_15_1819045	8	The plan to unify Citigroup 's businesses under a new , single brand is part of an ambitious campaign by the chairman and chief executive , Charles O. Prince III , to better integrate the bank 's sprawling parts after years of acquisitions -- a strategy investors are still waiting to see pay off .
2007_01_15_1819045	9	Symbolically , it also marks the end of an era .
2007_01_15_1819045	10	Just as a new name became one of the signatures of a transformative deal by the former chairman , Sanford I. Weill , a more coherent brand strategy signals Mr. Prince 's plans to shift the focus of a company sometimes seen as a deal machine to one largely powered by internal and international growth .
2007_01_15_1819045	11	The brand makeover comes out of the playbook of other big companies .
2007_01_15_1819045	12	Apple Computer , for example , last week shortened its name to Apple emphasize its broader ambitions for other technologies , like the new iPhone .
2007_01_15_1819045	13	Several years ago , Morgan Stanley ditched the suffix of Dean Witter , and Federal Express became just FedEx .
2007_01_15_1819045	14	By shedding the suffix '' group '' as well as the red umbrella , Mr. Prince is severing the bank 's most tangible ties to Mr. Weill , Citigroup 's patriarch , who made the old Travelers Group logo a key term of that company 's landmark 1998 merger with Citicorp and who is rarely seen without a small umbrella pin affixed to his lapel .
2007_01_15_1819045	15	Over two decades under Mr. Weill , Commercial Credit turned into the Travelers Group , which morphed into Citigroup -- while many of its operating businesses like the retail operations , Citibank , and the brokerage arm , Smith Barney , adopted their own looks and retained their old names .
2007_01_15_1819045	16	Over the last few years , Citigroup 's consumer businesses took on the '' citi '' prefix to become CitiBank or CitiMortgage without an overarching plan or a formal approval process .
2007_01_15_1819045	17	Its card business , which spends the largest amount on advertising , became known as Citi .
2007_01_15_1819045	18	The result , in the eyes of some , was a mishmash of logos and titles that appeared disconnected , while many Wall Street clients , Main Street customers and even Citigroup employees simply referred to the different parts of the conglomerate as Citi .
2007_01_15_1819045	19	Now , Mr. Prince hopes to unify the company under one global name at a time he is urging more cooperation between the businesses .
2007_01_15_1819045	20	He also hopes to achieve some small cost savings on media spending , which totaled $ 623 million in 2005 , according to TNS Media Intelligence .
2007_01_15_1819045	21	Most of the operating businesses are expected to adopt the '' Citi '' prefix , but each will use a different color arc to maintain a distinct look .
2007_01_15_1819045	22	Citi 's corporate and investment bank will feature a black arc ; its wealth management division will use a red arc , and its consumer businesses , a blue arc .
2007_01_15_1819045	23	Banamex , its Mexican retail bank , and Smith Barney are expected to retain the old names .
2007_01_15_1819045	24	Since October 2005 , a panel of senior Citigroup business leaders and marketing executives has been evaluating the future of the brand .
2007_01_15_1819045	25	At the time , Mr. Prince said he believed that the company could benefit from '' a more coordinated approach '' to dealing with '' one of our most important assets . ''
2007_01_15_1819045	26	The company hired Landor Associates , a brand-consulting firm owned by the WPP Group , and put Ajay Banga , a co-head of its consumer businesses , who helped build PepsiCo 's Pizza Hut and KFC franchises in India , in charge of the review .
2007_01_15_1819045	27	Still , many in the company were divided .
2007_01_15_1819045	28	Top investment bank executives , some of whom had been campaigning for the resurrection of the Salomon Brothers name , initially thought that the adoption of the consumer brand 's Citi logo would cheapen their image .
2007_01_15_1819045	29	Smith Barney executives expressed similar concerns .
2007_01_15_1819045	30	By late fall , when Citigroup announced that it would call the New York Mets ' new stadium , CitiField , there was a growing consensus in favor of the new look .
2007_01_15_1819045	31	Plans were not final , however , until mid-December .
2007_01_15_1819045	32	At the same time , other Citigroup managers were deeply divided over the fate of the red umbrella .
2007_01_15_1819045	33	In the end , however , Citigroup 's brand committee decided to drop the 137-year-old symbol , which has adorned the bank 's pitch books , buildings and business cards -- as well as some executive attire .
2007_01_15_1819045	34	It has also been a source of local controversy .
2007_01_15_1819045	35	In 1997 , a TriBeCa community association petitioned to have the neon umbrella removed from Travelers ' 39-story headquarters building at 388 Greenwich Street , now home to its investment bank .
2007_01_15_1819045	36	The New York City Buildings Department said it was a logo , not a sign , and it stayed after the company agreed to dim its lights overnight and turn it off for four hours after sunset .
2007_01_15_1819045	37	Now it appears that the umbrella will be folded up altogether .
2007_01_15_1819045	38	Citigroup executives said that outside marketing research suggested that the umbrella had no resonance for bank customers in the United States , especially since the Travelers insurance businesses had been spin off .
2007_01_15_1819045	39	Outside the country , a bank executive , the symbol is associated with insurance as well as with bad luck in certain Asian countries .
2007_01_15_1819045	40	Whether or not Citigroup retains the rights , or sells it to another company , remains a question .
2007_01_15_1819045	41	It is also unclear what will happen to the 16-foot , 5,300 steel umbrella that sits outside the investment bank in Lower Manhattan .
2007_01_15_1819045	42	Of course , Mr. Prince may already have a place to display it in mind .
2007_01_15_1819045	43	Several months ago , he half-jokingly suggested to Mr. Weill that '' if it ever does happen , that he is going to have to take the umbrella in front of our office downtown and move it out to my home in Greenwich , '' Mr. Weill recalled in an interview last fall .
2007_01_15_1819045	44	A Greenwich Zoning Department official said that any structure above six feet requires the agency 's approval .
2007_01_15_1819046	0	It will be one week tomorrow since Steven P. Jobs , the chief executive of Apple , introduced the iPhone , the company 's long-awaited entry into the cellphone world .
2007_01_15_1819046	1	Since then , gadget reviewers waxed poetic about the iPhone 's design ; Cisco Systems , which makes a phone by the same name , filed a trademark infringement lawsuit ; and Apple 's stock hit a record high before closing Friday at $ 94.62 a share .
2007_01_15_1819046	2	All this happened against the backdrop of a federal inquiry into backdated stock options at Apple .
2007_01_15_1819046	3	Now , it remains to be seen whether the iPhone can chip at the market share of the BlackBerry manufacturer , Research In Motion , or even Sharp , which introduced the Sidekick III in July .

2007_01_15_1819048	1	He uses swing rhythm as a foursquare entity , rather than warping it or battling against it ; he 's averse to dissonance except as tiny , unobtrusive details in a powerful euphony .
2007_01_15_1819048	2	He 's unusually presentable .
2007_01_15_1819048	3	Mr. Clayton , 22 , made a quick visit to New York over the weekend , playing Saturday night at the Jazz Gallery , with David Wong on bass and Pete Van Ostrand on drums .
2007_01_15_1819048	4	It was a secure set , mixing originals and standards and bringing in the trumpeter Roy Hargrove in its last third .
2007_01_15_1819048	5	As a measure of the consensus around Mr. Clayton , the house was packed even though he has n't made his own record .
2007_01_15_1819048	6	The son of the jazz bassist John Clayton and lately a presence on Diana Krall 's records , Mr. Clayton comes from Los Angeles , where he studied at the University of Southern California .
2007_01_15_1819048	7	When he inevitably moves to New York , we 'll be hearing more about him .
2007_01_15_1819048	8	This is n't a blind guess ; there just are n't a lot of pianists who have so much organized at such a young age .
2007_01_15_1819048	9	His style synthesizes economy , variety and harmonic ideas from players like Cedar Walton and Kenny Barron , as well as some flourishes and grandstanding energy from Oscar Peterson and Art Tatum .
2007_01_15_1819048	10	It 's also an armored style , with a decent amount of glibness and facile blues language ; one that , for whatever reason , regards dissonance , abruptness and space as undesirable options .
2007_01_15_1819048	11	Leaning toward the old school , Mr. Clayton may not have that undefinable elasticity , that ability to let go at the more abstract , higher level that a lot of serious pianists in his generation are developing .
2007_01_15_1819048	12	What he does have is control over technique and the arc of a performance , and those can be devastating strengths .
2007_01_15_1819048	13	He did n't get the most of Billy Strayhorn 's '' Isfahan , '' which he fussed over too much , burying a beautiful chord progression under piles of grace notes and decorous phrases .
2007_01_15_1819048	14	But he can swing at very fast tempos , and he can play quietly in a slow ballad and , even better , at medium tempo .
2007_01_15_1819048	15	He did this in an original piece called '' Two Heads , One Pillow . ''
2007_01_15_1819048	16	It began cool and wary , with a bass ostinato echoed in the piano 's bass clef ; after the theme , Mr. Clayton began his solo with hard , argumentative phrases , but his left hand , inside the piano , damped the strings , muffling the notes .
2007_01_15_1819048	17	By the time the piece ended , it had gone through three or four major dynamic surges , one of them using the momentum of Mr. Hargrove 's solo .
2007_01_15_1819048	18	And when Mr. Clayton regained control in the last chorus , swinging quietly again , there was a sense that he was on to something .
2007_01_15_1819048	19	Listeners looked satisfied , as if they 'd solved a puzzle or been let in on a secret .
2007_01_15_1819048	20	The Gerald Clayton Trio will return to the Jazz Gallery , 290 Hudson Street , SoHo , on March 24 .
2007_01_15_1819050	0	For 2006 the big day was Thursday , when the firm released its annual retail report of hardware sales and the Top 10 selling console games of the year .
2007_01_15_1819050	1	( The data released on Thursday do not include PC games . )
2007_01_15_1819050	2	The list includes a mixture of sequels and newcomers ; some well regarded games did n't make it at all .
2007_01_15_1819050	3	SAY HELLO TO THE NEW BOSS , SAME AS THE OLD BOSS -- Last week , before the sales report came out , I was talking to an industry executive about the ubiquity of online PC games in South Korea .
2007_01_15_1819050	4	He brought up just who really rules the video-game roost in the United States : a television football analyst who young players may not even realize was once a coach , John Madden . ''
2007_01_15_1819050	5	Well , yes , online gaming has become a part of the culture in Korea , '' he said , '' just like an entire generation of young men in America have grown up on Madden football and Madden has become a dominant part of pop culture for a big swath of the population here . ''
2007_01_15_1819050	6	The numbers for 2006 back up that assessment .
2007_01_15_1819050	7	For the second year in a row , a version of Madden NFL football from Electronic Arts topped the charts , with 2.8 million games sold for Sony 's PlayStation 2 .
2007_01_15_1819050	8	Perhaps even more telling , the top version of Madden has placed no lower than third every year since 2001 .
2007_01_15_1819050	9	Every summer , it seems , there are articles about potential '' Madden fatigue '' setting in among the game 's rabid player base .
2007_01_15_1819050	10	And every year , it seems , the franchise seems to maintain its momentum , just as the National Football League always seems to stand astride televised sports like a colossus .
2007_01_15_1819050	11	In the same vein , Sony deserves credit for the continued strength and popularity of the now-venerable PS2 , priced at only $ 129 .
2007_01_15_1819050	12	Sony has taken a lot of heat for the lackluster inauguration of its PlayStation 3 , but the PS2 was actually the top-selling home game console in the holiday season , and half of the Top 10 games of 2006 were for the older system .
2007_01_15_1819050	13	Like Madden itself , the PS2 has practically become a fixture in the homes and consciousness of Americans under age 35 .
2007_01_15_1819050	14	SOMETIMES YOU CAN TAKE IT WITH YOU -- In looking at last year 's breakout hits , the first game that comes to mind is Gears of War , the intense , sumptuous third-person shooter for the Xbox 360 that lived up to all the considerable hype that Microsoft had generated to promote it ; it came in at No. 3 for the year .
2007_01_15_1819050	15	But perhaps the more interesting and far-reaching newcomers to the Top 10 list were two games for Nintendo 's portable DS unit .
2007_01_15_1819050	16	( The DS stands for the unit 's dual screens . )
2007_01_15_1819050	17	While much attention has focused , deservedly , on the innovations in Nintendo 's new Wii home console , the DS has not so quietly taken over the buzz in the handheld game market , putting a beating on Sony 's more powerful but less fun PlayStation Portable -- much as the Wii is besting Sony 's more powerful but less fun PlayStation 3 .
2007_01_15_1819050	18	With 1.6 million units sold , the DS was the top-selling game machine in the country overall in December , beating out even the PlayStation 2 .
2007_01_15_1819050	19	The PSP , meanwhile , sold fewer than 1 million units last month , according to NPD .
2007_01_15_1819050	20	And though a new DS Mario Brothers game ranking at No. 2 was not a surprise , perhaps even more impressive was the No. 7 showing of the DS game Brain Age , which in some ways is hardly a game at all .
2007_01_15_1819050	21	Instead , Brain Age is a collection of mental exercises , like math problems , meant to encourage and develop continued cerebral activity in seniors .
2007_01_15_1819050	22	While Sony and Microsoft continue to cater mostly to the hard-core young male gamer , Nintendo has staked its future on bringing a much broader demographic into the game world .
2007_01_15_1819050	23	It seems to be working .
2007_01_15_1819050	24	IS THERE ANYBODY OUT THERE ?
2007_01_15_1819050	25	-- Of course , Top 10 lists are telling not just for what is on them , but also for what 's missing .
2007_01_15_1819050	26	And in 2006 there were two games in particular from famous developers that scored well with critics , but failed to crack the top sales echelon .
2007_01_15_1819050	27	For the second year in a row , Rockstar Games tried mightily to prove that it deserved to be known not just as the company that makes Grand Theft Auto .
2007_01_15_1819050	28	And for the second year in a row , it failed .
2007_01_15_1819050	29	In 2005 Rockstar 's game the Warriors seemed well made and creative , but it just did n't move in stores . .
2007_01_15_1819050	30	Last year Rockstar 's Bully seemed well made , creative and whimsical as well ( you have to like a video game set at a dysfunctional boarding school ) , but it did n't fly off the shelves .
2007_01_15_1819050	31	And so , for all of the company 's attempts to diversify , this year the spotlight will once again be on G.T.A. ; Grand Theft Auto IV is expected later this year and will almost surely be a monster hit .
2007_01_15_1819050	32	The other slightly disappointing sales result came from the Elder Scrolls IV : Oblivion , the sprawling single-player role-playing game from Bethesda Softworks .
2007_01_15_1819050	33	Those results , however , are a bit easier to explain .
2007_01_15_1819050	34	First of all , many people who like that sort of game prefer to play them on PCs rather than on consoles , and PC figures were missing from the NPD data .
2007_01_15_1819050	35	Second , the tide in role-playing games has clearly shifted to massively multiplayer online games like World of Warcraft .
2007_01_15_1819050	36	Sotto voce , some game executives have accused World of Warcraft of sucking everyone else 's air out of the genre .
2007_01_15_1819050	37	If anyone would know , perhaps it is the single-player loyalists at Bethesda .
2007_01_15_1819050	38	And with the first retail expansion pack for W.O.W. scheduled to hit stores tomorrow , a lot of the rest of the industry had better start reaching for oxygen masks .
2007_01_15_1819051	0	In the highlight of the Hassan Hakmoun show at Symphony Space on Saturday night , the Moroccan-born Hakmoun brothers had a gnawa dance-off .
2007_01_15_1819051	1	AbderRahim Hakmoun , dressed in an orange tunic and a bejeweled , fezlike hat , spun its tassel like a helicopter propeller , smacking his bare feet on the stage in a complex pattern .
2007_01_15_1819051	2	Hassan Hakmoun , playing a sintir ( a three-stringed , wood and camel-skin lute ) , matched his younger brother 's furious rhythm , whipping around his long , reddish dreadlocks . ''
2007_01_15_1819051	3	This is a traditional African foot stomp , '' Hassan Hakmoun said , describing it as the root of American tap dance .
