goldberg offers everything i look for in a general practitioner
he's nice and easy to talk to without being patronizing; he's always on time in seeing his patients; he's affiliated with a top-notch hospital (nyu) which my parents have explained to me is very important in case something happens and you need surgery; and you can get referrals to see specialists without having to see him first
really, what more do you need
i'm sitting here trying to think of any complaints i have about him, but i'm really drawing a blank
A bumpy first experience with Modern, but alls well that ends well
Although you may call a specific location, that location might not be the one that answers the phone, so from the get-go, we had a bit of scheduling confusion
I had perused the services menu online prior to calling, and had selected the Fresh Face Facial
As I scheduled my appointment, the receptionist mentioned that it was typically for teenagers, but given that I felt this was best for my needs, she booked it for me anyway, no questions asked
When I showed up, I was pleasantly greeted and quickly ushered back to the waiting room, where I was asked if I wanted anything to drink (from reading other Yelp reviews, apparently they have wine
The chairs were comfy, the lighting moodful, and there were a few magazines to read while passing the time
Once I was called back to my room, it got awkward
Apparently the service I'd booked was ONLY available for teenagers, although neither the website nor the receptionist indicated this restriction when I booked my appointment
The aesthetician and I played an awkward cat and mouse game as she tried to upsell me to another facial
Given that price was one of the factors I'd used in not only selecting my facial choice, but also one of the reasons I'd chosen Modern over another spa, I was a bit peeved
My face is the same size as a teenager, and I'm breaking out like it's the mid-90s all over again, so I don't see why there should be a $15 upcharge (which she told me was the standard price difference between the Fresh Face Facial for teenagers and the comparable offering for adults)
Finally, she said that since I hadn't been told this during the reservation, they would honor the appointment as scheduled
Nice outcome, but making your clients uncomfortable from the get-go is not the best customer service experience
We began the facial, and I told her I had been having some skin problems over the last few months
Instead of generally asking me what products I use, she immediately said "do you use Aveda products
"  Here, we go - informercial central; time to sell some product
Luckily that was the only sales push I got, but again - an impact to the customer experience
Once we got over those hurdles, it was actually a very pleasant experience
My aesthetician was easy to talk to, and what she did felt great on my face
Ultimately, I was pleased with the service (product-related) I received but felt there were some challenges with how the service (customer-focused) was delivered
Not sure if or when I will return
Left something to be desired
It was more like a fast food joint environment and in the way the employees acted
The food didn't taste fresh and they put too much sauce on that tasted more like ketchup than anything else
Maybe I have a discerning BBQ taste because I lived in the south for five years, but it was definitely sub par
I went to cheese 'n stuff to buy cheese and the choices were laughable
It's not even a cheese shop
If your interested in purchasing cheese go to Duck & Decanter, Wedge and Bottle, or AJ's
We had an event catered last night by Postino for a group of 30
The event was a fabulous success
The service, both during the planning process and delivery was excellent
If you've never catered food before, please, for your own sanity, consider Postino
They're easy to work with
They also offer discounts for non-profits
We will be using them for many events in the future
As far as airports go, this one is really easy to get in and out of
Either way: Picking people up, or taking off for fun and adventure, this place is pretty convenient
Nothing even remotely close to the nightmares such as LAX or San Francisco Intl
This place is a piece of cake
Not sure if other airports have these cell phone lots, but this is a new con convenient deal
You park in a special lot with a giant sign that reports when all flights are either in the air or have arrived
You hang out and wait for your friends and family to arrive, THEN you start cruising the pickup area looking for your passengers
You can expect: cold fries , gross or uncarbonated drinks , cold burgers that have been sitting there ect
I usually don't write reviews but with flu , fever , and gross food; I'll be going hungry tonight
Save yourself a trip and go to Ellsworth
So I too had great expectations for this place and was very disappointed
The ordering system is weird, the wait time was too long, and the food was just not that great
I ordered the white pizza and it had no taste at all
My husband ordered the supreme pizza and it was actually decent
That's why I gave this place two stars
It was too expensive for what we got and we won't be back
We are there two to three times per week
In general the service has been good with a few exceptions and the food is good
We have also experienced bad choices for music (Rap)
Last night when we asked them to make a different music selection the bartender put on some sort of slow wedding music
That kind of statement was certainly un-called for
In general KO's is a good place to have a drink and lunch or dinner
Not sure if the sushi master was really in training or if they intended to serve pieces that are too big and loose to eat in one bite
Either way, it was kind of a mess to eat
Positives: large selection on menu, including combination specials with beer
Who couldn't appreciate that
Our food was served fresh and fast
Amongst our group, we had an apple turnover which has delicious frosting, jalepeno poppers, Reubens, a roast beef sandwich, a couple of shakes, and fries
They only had one apple turnover left so we had to split one
The chocolate shake was really a vanilla shake with chocolate syrup squirted in for decoration
The rest of the food was incredible
Totally bummed about the shake and turnover
The best Korean restaurant in town
Located on Sahara Ave, they offer pretty good deal for the price
As my husband says, "In vegas you can get what you paid for
I ordered Soon dub with seafood
Spiciness is just right for me
My husband ordered Combo, which comes with Kalbi, Chicken and Meat Jun
This is his favorite plate
He used to come here with his dad when he was alive and my husband was living in Vegas
They recently renovated this place and according to my husband, the place is double the size of before
And the price is reasonable
I def recommend this place
This place is definitely  "meh"
had a pepperoni with chopped garlic, also an order of onion rings and garlic bread
I"ll start with the pizza first
It was just a notch above supermarket stuff
Not worth the money, won't be back
The crust isn't my thing (too squishy and bleh), very bland flavor and I suspect the cheese on this  pie re-heated  for the second night is gonna be rubber
(seemed to already be going that direction as I ate)
Could barely taste the garlic
it was there a bit, but not much
Overall lacking in flavor and seasonings
Didn't even smell very pizza-ish
The onion rings had practically NO TASTE which is difficult to do with onion rings, but they accomplished it here
And the garlic bread was
I wish I'd saved the $34 this cost and bought a few grocery pizzas to shove in the freezer when I had a pizza craving
would have been just about as good
Very disappointed because a lot of people apparently like this place but I'd skip it if you know the difference between good and meh pizza
I didn't try anything else on the menu so maybe they do some things really well
just not the pizza I ordered
Terrible service and attention to detail
I took my bike in to have it tuned up
I wanted to make sure the front derailer was properly aligned so it wouldn't derail while I was pushing hard (and NOT shifting)
I was told that I need a new set of rings since the old ones were worn and likely to cause the chain to derail
This may be an issue if you have problems while shifting
but not once you're in a gear
but I went along and over paid for the part and extra installation fee
When I got my bike back two days later, the new ring was on but the derailer wasn't touched
It was still set up for the old set of rings
The chain was "on", but one crank at it fell off
Whatever shortfalls a pizza may have are typically ignored in the drunken feeding frenzy or drowned out by copious lathering in ranch sauce
Falbo Brothers has performed an amazing feat by producing a pizza so vile and foul that not only could I not finish a single slice, but I was nearly brought to vomiting by the mere sight of my brother taking bites of this sewage-inspired cheese pie
The owner is a great guy, very friendly, takes time to explain things, and gives you what you need
I bought a bike for my younger brother, which he rode around a bit, and decided he wanted something a little more rugged -- we brought it back (with a flat tire and slightly bent rim - whoops
) and the owner offered to swap it out for a comparable bike, helped my brother pick one, and adjusted the seat --- DID I MENTION THIS WAS ALL WITHIN 3 MINUTES OF CLOSING TIME
He stayed a little late to help us and then even recommended a restaurant close by (Wagon Wheel - figures, right
This area is shady, but the owner and the store is not
My family and I ate lunch here for the first and last time
The beans were greasy and the enchiladas were like soup
The burros were alright but I've had much better
He was obviously flustered when I asked for recommendations
He seriously has no clue about wines
This is a great sports bar
Food is good, fine bar food
If you are expecting to e blown away, don't
The beer menu has expanded, including more and better beers as time has gone on
I have been coming here for almost 5 years now
The staff is a little dodgy as they seem to be way more wrapped up in whatever they have going on than attending tables
However, once they recognize that you've been waiting they're real nice and usually make some generous drinks
Nice pool table and great TV set up
It is difficult to have a bad time here, it is however equally difficult to have an amazing time
Food is good, ribs were fall off the bone tender
Brandon was a huge fan of the Mac and Cheese which certainly has a kick
What I really appreciate is the manager's attitude
He really cares about the customer and making things right
I used to review restaurants professionally, and he really gets it
Go here if you want great service, and chug some half priced beer
Ordered lunch for 4 people (delivered)
every order was mediocre at BEST
I ordered the grilled ham & cheese, but I don't consider processed cheese slices "cheese" + 2 skimpy slices of ham & soggy fries
Definitely NOT worth the $8
Needless to say their menu is now in our recycle bin
Not the best gelato I've had in the states
A little grainy and had some ice in it too
I would try somewhere else
My husband was 9 minutes late to an appointment with the nurse
They turned him away because he was late
The last time we were in the office we waited over 40 minutes for somebody to enter the exam room
And you're telling me we would have seen the nurse exactly at 10 am had he been on time
Last visit at their office
Burlington Coat factory has some amazing mark downs, but like Ross you really have to sift through the layers upon layers of clothing in order to find something worth the (discounted) price
Overall the store is laid out in sheer madness
The different departments intersect with the super discounts and the new items all over the store
Alas, the designer shirts, suits, and ties for the men are neat
I've stayed here twice and the first time wasn't so bad
I wasn't expecting much for the price, but we didn't run into any problems because we were staying in the newly remodeled north tower
The second time, we arrived at 2am due to a chemical spill on the freeway that turned our 4 hour drive into an 8 hour drive
When we got there, we had to stand in a huge line and right before our turn the clerk let a lady cut in front of us because she was having a problem with our room
Okay, but I just wanted to get to our room
Turns out that this lady wanted a new room because the toilet was broken so they switched her rooms
When we were finally helped, I was told that the King size non-smoking room that I reserved was no longer available and that all she had left was a king size smoking or a double queen non smoking
Yeah because they had just given our room away to the other lady
But, being so tired, I was in no room to argue so I just went with the double queen non-smoking
It must have been the room that the other lady had just turned in
When we got there, first of all you could hear the entire freemont street experience from the bathroom every hour
There were NO TOWELS, The bathroom floor was soaking wet and there was hair on it, disgusting
And the carpet near the bathroom was soaking wet too
But, being that it was so late, all the other hotels were booked and that we literally only needed to sleep for a couple hours, my boyfriend wiped up the water with a bathmat and we went to sleep
A few hours later, we were awoken by a god awful "Bloop" noise every few minutes
The toilet was making bubbles and that's where the water was coming from
There was toilet water all over the tile and carpet, so gross
I couldn't even pee because I was afraid to sit on the toilet in fear that I might bubble while I was on it
The only good thing that I have to say about this place is that they gave us our money back
We have eaten at Macayo's many times over the years
We have always found the food to be fresh, perfectly prepared and the service fast
We have our special Macayo's beer glasses that we take for refills that are cheaper than the the bar prices and they always clean them before we start and after we are done and wrap them up for us to take home again
I would say this is the best, most consistent Mexican place we have found nearby and have never had a bad meal here or bad service
They do a great job and we find at times we need our Macayo's "fix" and are never disappointed
ask for Clenard, he is a fantastic waiter and just an overall great guy
We bring visitors here and will continue to recommend it
When I stopped and asked for directions to this hotel, some girls explained the lack of a sign here because "if you don't already know where it is, then they don't want you there"
So upon walking in, the girl at the guest services was so snotty and rude I left
You could hear a friggin pin drop in that place it was so dead
Why hasn't this place closed yet
Old looking building, rude greeting staff
Went with my wife to have happy hour drinks and appetizers
Our waiter just wasn't good
He didn't write down the order, so of course, he got it wrong
He seems to have all the time in the world to chit chat with us (even though we really didn't want to talk to him), but when it came time to take an order, see how we were doing, or correct his mistake, he always had to rush off
Maybe if you are spending $100/person on dinner you get better service, but we will be avoiding the Palm in the future
To be honest this place wasn't awful but just not what I expected
To me the Luxor is a Vegas classic like the MGM or Caesars, you know people know this hotel and it's part of the heart of the Vegas strip
So with that in mind I did have sorta/kinda high expectations
When we arrived at 1am, the line to check in was like a Disneyland ride line
Luckily I had a drink bought for me and the line actually moved
I was excited to stay in the pyramid part of the hotel because I thought it would be fun but obviously it's the part of the hotel that hadn't been renovated; which explains why the tower rooms are more expensive because when I got a chance to up to one of those rooms (which I wont say how because what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas) those rooms are so much nicer
It wasn't gross and old like some off the strip hotel but it wasn't as luxurious as I pictured it to be AND, this is an important and, the bathroom toilet in our room hadn't been cleaned and we had to have someone come up and clean it
Which set the tone for housekeeping for the rest of the weekend, they really didn't clean
Also the toilet was extremely low flow, it couldn't flush down toilet paper
But the staff that I had interacted with was very friendly, surprisingly so for the amount of people that were staying at the hotel and no doubt the amount of rude people I'm sure they had to deal with
We really stayed here for the Bodies exhibit, which was amazing
I can't even describe this exhibit you just have to see it for yourself
We ended up buying a ticket package for $54 that was for three exhibits, so on top the Bodies exhibit we saw Titanic and the Reef at Mandalay
The Titanic exhibit was wayyyyy better then I expected it to be; it was so captivating and entertaining
My thoughts on the The Reef at Mandalay are a little skewed since I didn't sleep the night before, so I was dead tired, maybe a little drunk still and heading towards a hang over; and there were way more kids there then made it worth it
The price for the rooms will get me to stay here again
I was in Vegas for a convention this weekend and came here with a big group (14 people)
We were seated for dinner at a long table in what's usually the bakery, but we were able to order from their regular menu
We were served complimentary bread while we looked over the menu, and we also ordered drinks
I got an alright pomegranate martini for about $14
After glancing over the prices for their regular menu items (between $17 and $28 for various kinds of pasta) we were informed of a $30 dinner special they were offering as a part of Restaurant Week
$4 would go to charity and it was a great selection of food as well - the $30 included an appetizer (minestrone, flatbread, or salad), entree (chicken, vodka sauce fettucine, or salmon), and dessert (tiramisu or zabaione with berries)
Most of my group went for the $30 offer, including me
The minestrone was well-seasoned, warm, and filling
It was appropriately portioned as well
I wish I had gone with the salmon instead of the chicken, but it turned out to be well-cooked and juicy with some nice potatoes on the side
Wasn't too big a fan of the quickly-sauteed spinach that served as the bed, though
The zabaione was a nice way to end the meal - nice and light after a pretty heavy dish
In my opinion, an Italian restaurant should either be super affordable and homey-tasting, or more expensive/splurgy but worth it in quality and innovation
This place didn't do either
I can't say I'd spend $30 here when my company wasn't paying for it (haha) but it was an okay experience nonetheless
A party of 7 - we drank water 1 appetizer and a $600 check all in the confines of an indoor mall
Don't get me wrong, the food was wonderful but just a bit out of hand
2 pairs of people ordered the same entree items and they came out completely different sizes and  for myself, the shrimp was just not delicious
For 36 bucks I wants some delicious shrimp
The server was by far the worst server I've ever encountered
I wanted to read the menu but he insisted on up-selling every freaking thing
Dude back the f-up, I wanna read, not hear the ingredients in a rue
He kept interrupting our rather enjoyable conversation to tell us about "artisinal water" or some other crap they've up-charged for
Frankly at the end of the night I felt like I was just sold a used car with a side of fish
Hey Rick, time to rethink your wait staff
This one waiter RUINED your restaurant
I needed a quick breakfast/lunch place and I stumbled upon the Wynn
I was hesitant to  find food in there because there are so many fancy stores in there and I assumed all of any food in there would be hella expensive
Sugar and Ice is the first food shop you see when you enter and we walked most of the entire Wynn to find food but this was the only cheap place
There are macarons, pastries, and some want food goodies and even though I wasn't gelato for breakfast or a granola yogurt cup, I opted for the spinach egg and cheese burrito
It took forever for the food to arrive and service isn't very attentive but when I finally got it, that thing is massive
I only finished half the burrito or so and my three other friends picked at the other half
The egg is flavorless so you need salsa on the side
I thought for $8 it wasn't that bad for a ok quality breakfast burrito
1) If you need cheap food and the only option is Wynn, then this is your only option
2) Their chocolate crunch gelato looks so good
great decor, selection, "wine flights", location was in a nice mall, food was nice, but expensive for what you got
I probably would not go back
3 of us mom's took our 3 daughters for their 21st birthday and we had a blast
We actually lucked out because I called just 2 weeks ahead and they had an empty booth that just fit 6 people
they said normally people book months in advance
Anyway it wasn't too over the top that mom's with their daughters couldn't enjoy and was a once in a lifetime (my daughter only turns 21 once) opportunity for fun memories
A little expensive but worth it, fun time had by all
After going here for my and my husband's 1 year anniversary, i believe that social house pays people to write good reviews
The $125 we paid for 2 rolls, a few beers, and miso and edamame might not have felt like such a rip off if the amount of fish in our rolls was even detectable
The lemon slices on top of my salmon roll were thicker than the salmon slices on top of the roll
Starting to lose faith in yelp
Excellent option for dinner in Vegas
Sexy ambiance, good food, reasonable prices for what it is
And dinner gets you immediate entry into one of the best clubs in Vegas
For a place advertise "seafood" as speciality
They need to take cooking class
My friend and I were in the mood for some Indian cuisine
4 stars on Yelp is pretty good, right
Unfortunately, the best thing that can be said about this place is it has a nice interior, more upscale than your typical Indian establishment
Otherwise, the food was decidedly mediocre and the service was absolutely atrocious, some of the worst I've experienced in a long time
But let's start from the beginning
On a big banner right outside the restaurant, they advertised a 3-course dinner for two for $29
Upon inquiring about this option, our waiter informed us that special was no longer being offered and they've been meaning to take it down
However, they did have a 5-course tasting menu, served family-style, for $45 per person
Now either the waiter was bullshitting us or their website which advertises the same special is out-of-date as well
Either way, this is what you call a classic "bait and switch" and FALSE advertising
We should have taken the hint and walked out then, but we were hungry
Unfortunately this same thought would be a recurring theme throughout the rest of the evening
So we asked what was included in the 5-course tasting menu and were not terribly excited by what we heard and it didn't seem worth anywhere near $90 for the two of us
We asked for a "few more minutes" to peruse the menu
After about 5 minutes, we decided to get the sweet apricot and raisin naan ($4), chicken tikka makhani ($13), seven spice veal ($25), baby eggplant ($11), and 2 side dishes of chana massala and aloo gobi ($7 each)
Oh and we had to pay another $3 for a single order rice because none of the entrees came with any
We ended up waiting another 15 minutes before another waiter spotted us looking a bit perturbed and asked if we needed anything
We told him we were ready to order
I thought he was going to take our order but instead he just told our original waiter that we were ready and would be "right with us"
Our waiter was running a couple's credit card with one of those portable terminals right at their table
After the receipt was signed, the waiter continued to idly chat with them for another 5 minutes or so
Then our waiter disappeared into the kitchen or God knows where for another 10 minutes before finally coming to take our order
After asking for the check, we waited over 15 minutes before our waiter returned and was expecting to collect the check
When we explained that we still had not received the check, he disappeared for another 4-5 minutes before finally returning with our check
We usually pay via credit card, but decided that we better settle up in cash lest we want to spend another half an hour waiting
I almost never leave no tip, but I'm thinking this is one of the rare situations that qualify
However, my friend lobbies hard to leave at least 10%
As we're walking back to our cars, a Black crack whore tries to solicit us
Ah, a fitting end to such a memorable evening
Here's the executive summary: nice interior ambiance, over-priced mediocre food, horrendous service
I am sorely tempted to give this 1-star but since the food was at least edible (except for the undercooked potatoes) I suppose it just BARELY merits 2 stars
Take my advice: save your money AND time
Just go somewhere else, like Mount Everest, Namaste, or Samosa Factory
Good coffee and friendly atmosphere
Place is way too small, thou
I really prefer the one at fort apache
Ordered a "road warrior" iced blended coffee and a banana nut muffin
Coffee was very good, pastry was OK
All fine for a Sunday afternoon and a good magazine
One thing I hated from this place was the amount freakin flies
Overall, its a fine place
We must have gone on a really bad night because I'm not sure how so many people gave this restaurant 4 stars
First off, I wanted to really like this restaurants as it was Mario Batali's but I could not overlook the poor service nor the quality of our meal
-Two out of the 4 dishes we ordered which were pasta dishes were way undercooked
We all like and know what al dente is but it was definitely inedible
How can such a well known italian restaurant mess up on pasta
We sent the food back right away and when it came out again, the portions were smaller
-Two out of the 4 dishes did not taste good at all and 2 were just okay
Most of the dishes (appertizers) were mediocre
It was unfortunate as we were celebrating a special occasion and no one really enjoyed their meal
This experience won't deter me from trying other Mario Batali restaurants, but this one in particular i would never come back to nor recommend to anyone
This is the worst McDonald's ever
Customer Service is horrible
My boyfriend and I ordered a caramel sundae and the guy forgot to ring it up, he didn't give is us our receipt so we didn't know
The lady at the window got mad when we asked for a copy of our receipt and was like fuck then slammed the window
So the guy who took our order named Miguel came and was like uhm I'mma need $2
First off the sundae's are $1 we only wanted a copy of the receipt bc there was a long line behind us
Then he was like fuck you guys get the fuck out of here
My bf was so pissed off but I told him to just go
So he drives stick and had to change his gear so the MANAGER on duty comes and was like bitch don't ever come back here we will refuse your service fuck you, get the fuck off the lot
My boyfriend of course yelled fuck you as we pulled off and this stupid unprofessional moron screamed fuck you cunts while flipping us off
All bc we wanted a copy of our receipt because the dumb ass didn't give it to us
This McD will NEVER get another penny from me or any of my friends
Rudest people and service in my life
I only had to give 1 star to post
Wingstop is my only stop for wings in the valley
I like the lemon pepper wings, although they are a bit salty sometimes
The sides aren't that great so I stick with only wing take out orders, done in about 15 minutes
The fries are strangely dark brown and tend to taste like chicken
The price is about $2 more than I would like to pay but I keep going back so price is not that big of a turn off
Give the lemon pepper wings a try, you will love em
Real Cheez Whiz on your cheesesteak
A great end to any night of drinking
Yup, that's exactly what this place is
You can buy home-made Italian food,  desserts, breads, meats, and much more
I enjoyed the Chicken Parm Hot Sandwich and it was amazing
You could share it between two people
(I was only able to eat half)
Chicken parmesan is a popular dish but this has to be hands down the best I've tasted
For dessert I had a Cannoli, and the filling was finger licking good
Everything was so fresh and truly makes you feel like your eating a home-made meal
The location is hidden behind the Chipotle across from UNLV, so don't let the looks fool you
Went to MIX about a month ago, been going there for years
I still had a good time, but the new music was awful
It really brought down the experience
I used to really like everything about MIX - great views, awesome bar/service, and fun music
It made more of a difference than I thought
It kind of left a bad taste in my mouth
I was really craving for Dosas and so went there for lunch with 2 friends
Learnt they don't serve from their menu for lunch and only have a buffet at that time :(
The food was pretty decent
Probably the best "non premium" pizza in Vegas and gives places like Grimaldi a run for their money
The meat was was marinated in a piquant, flavorful sauce, and came with lots of fresh cilantro (they asked first)
The tortas looked great, and they are, indeed "gigantes"
The place can only seat 16 or so, and you order at the window
Definitely my new go-to place for a quick and tasty lunch on the East side of town
BTW: the old name of the place  - Ay
Jose Takos - is still on the door, but the new name is Las Famosas de Jose
Ask Jose - he'll tell ya why
It's not like so great but not bad at all
(stumbling onto the stage and grabbing the mic)
The reviews for this typical hotel/resort bar are a bit harsh
The place where you go to watch the clustermess that is Las Vegas
You've been out at Tao across the street, but now you are stumbling into the casino at the T
It's not the best bar in the world
You can pick up some sort of fruity cocktail for your lady, and maybe an ice cold miller lite for yourself
you sure as hell don't have one of these in Iowa, Utah or even New York City
Appreciate this bar for what it is
The seating is comfortable, and the decor is actually quite stimulating, particularly if you've had one or 15 cocktails
(getting yanked off stage and hands mic to next patron)
Everyone is always looking for a hookup in Vegas, especially when it comes to getting into ANY club on The Strip
My boy spent some time asking friends to see if we could get our group of NINE people in without having to wait over two hours in line
Through a friend of a friend, we were able to get into Priv\u00e9 for FREE and without waiting in line
First off, you have to go up this escalator to even get to club which is located practically in the middle of the casino
It causes such crowded drama
I couldn't even see where the line was waiting
It just looked like a chaotic crowd of people hovering around the escalator
The place looked pretty small with how they set up the place
It was FILLED with VIP tables that there were little walking paths that went around them for the non-VIP'ers to walk around
It was pretty dark, you couldn't really see how pretty (or not) the club actually
What was totally bogus was that it was **$9** for a TINY bottle of Fiji water
=O We didn't stay long enough to find out how much the alcoholic drinks cost
We HAD to bounce after listening to the music
I mean, they went from Whitney Houston's "I Wanna Dance With Somebody" to a Gloria Estefan song
There was some hip hop in between, but the music was totally lame
We took off from the club after being there for less than an hour
I was happy we got the hookup because I would have been upset paying $30 or more to get into this place
I walked in and was impressed with the dining are of this place - it was rather tony
It is a contemporary design and feels inviting
I ordered a non spicy - spicy tuna roll
(my kids will not eat anything spicy)
Then we went with the Korean BBQ dinners with short ribs and the thinly sliced beef
They brought out the side dishes and salad
The kimchi, cucmbers, then they had some stuff that was tasty but I had no idea what it was, and potato salad
Everything tasted fresh and well prepared
I have only been to a few Korean BBQ places but I am really starting to get in to it
I am not an expert at Korean food, but this place was excellent
I have been to 3 other Korean joints in town and this was by far the nicest one
This place is tucked behind the busy streets of Dysart and McDowell
The environment is slightly dark but very comfortable, ambient music is very soothing and if you are a sports fan they offer a few HDTV at the main dining area as well as some more at the bar
The sushi price is a tad high if you order exotic items, which is why i only come during happy hours:
Their happy hour is awesome, an array of appetizers/drinks/rolls for 50% of the regular menu price
I highly recommend Crazy roll, i normally get some spicy tuna roll with it
The servers are always helpful and nice, it's a great place to have sushi
For the longest time I've had my friend Tiffany tell me all about this sushi bar called Teharu that sits right next to NYPD Pizza, at the intersection of Priest and 48th Street
It seemed like a good place for a fun dinner, and I've always been one to open up my appetite to new places, so I gave in on my friend's requests to go
Teharu was fairly close and I wasn't really going out of my way to try this new place
The location was about three or four miles away from where I live, give or take a few miles
When we got there, the exterior of the restaurant looked very plain
With tinted windows and boring, gray letters that read "Teharu" across the top, I was already feeling doubt about this place before I even walked through the door
When we ventured in, it was like a slap in the face
The place was about half full, not too busy it seemed
Lots of faces were smiling and there were a lot of cheerful conversations going on through the atmosphere
In front of us was a little stand that had a sign that said "Sign in and wait to be seated"
We were there for no longer than a minute or two before a small waitress with a huge grin came and greeted and seated us
We had seats right in front of the conveyor belt which was really exciting for me
Right when we sat down, the waitress had already been asking for our choice of drinks and anything else we needed
Practically right in front of you, there is a chart, with different colored plates labeled with different prices ranging from 1
So right off the bat I already knew that this place wasn't expensive at all, when usual sushi bars are a bit pricey, charging almost 6 or 7 dollars a plate
As I see each plate of sushi coming and going, I certainly didn't know where to begin
I had a few doubts, because with the plates continuously rotating until someone picks them up, you never knew how long the food was sitting there
Yet no one seemed to have a problem with it, so it must've been safe to eat
I've always been a big fan of sushi and the endless combinations of fish and vegetables so I couldn't wait any longer
The first plate I picked up was called a Spicy tuna roll
The plate was blue, so according to the chart in front of me, it was only 2 dollars
The first bite tasted exactly like how the name was, tuna and spicy
It was more delicious than what I expected it to be, so I downed the other 3 rolls right after the other
Another thing that I really loved about this place was that everything was convenient
All the sauces and napkins that you needed was already right at your table, so there was no need on asking a waiter for one
Although the workers came around and asked how we were doing often, there wouldn't be much of a problem to ask them for a thing or two
They were always right there if we had any questions or needed anything
A few conversations later I had already went through a few plates of sushi, and I had to admit I was getting very full very fast
I had another plate of Spicy Tuna rolls, along with a plate of tiger rolls, salmon rolls, california rolls, and dragon rolls
Even though the names on some of the selections were quite unusual, the taste brought it justice
There's a wide variety of selections, so even though some didn't seem appealing to me, I was sure that other customers were glad to have them
When the waitress has asked if we were ready to go, she had our check and we were out the door very quickly
I loved the employees, the food, and the environment
I will definitely be back soon, hungry for more
Definitely a nice place to unwind after a long day
Enjoyed a exquisite dessert with a hot cup of coffee while the soothing music and light chatter of people fill the room
I've eaten here twice since it recently opened
The pick up to go  was a horrible experience
Fajitas  for 2  were cold but that's not a problem since there were no tortillas present
Drove back, had them heat  some new ones ( I think they redid the old)   and even though I am under  5 minutes away they lost their heat
Manager was apologetic but  I get the feeling that it was cursory  rather than bollicking out the preparer for such an obvious error (
While the greeter was  decidedly not into  greeting us, there was something way more interesting occurring with a co worker , the server ,Robert,  rocked and for once I got the feeling that here's someone that's not being infected by whatever corporate style guide exists
Food was  in reasonable time
hot, as  described and my (un)usual order of a bacon cheeseburger with black bean patty   arrived   intact
Erin's chicken tacos were  pretty good but a look at the nutrition guide, post lunch, showed them to contain  more sodium and hfcs than Paris Hilton washing her mouth out with soda after making a video
(no I'm not proud of that line,  lies  I'm quite proud of it: :)
In and out   in under an hour
Fountain drinks  had the right syrup mix  and the price was  reasonable
While Yelp is providing me with many wonderful new places to try there are times, and it comes down to time where I need  to trade quality/ time ( e
g  lunch hour:) or places where a  crayon launching toddler is  not so out of place
To get "perlitical" for a moment many eschew the idea of chains as a valid option  due to their  repetitiveness  and narrow range of food/ options which  are somehow as seen as inflicting a limited range on people that frequent them
I like to treat them as if they were unique  and review them accordingly
If being in a chain means a reliance on frozen ready made parts to heat then  there's a hell of  a lot of independents shopping in the same freezer aisles / supply chain  alongside them and both should be called on it
Went here with my dad on a Friday Night
I recommend a reservation and plan to stay for the night
the constant need for easy, cheap and large-portioned foods
A hole in the wall kinda place with a hot grill and a nice arrangement of veggies, condiments and various sauces
I ordered the Grecian Delight and deee-lightful it was
There is a vast selection of pitas on the menu
The concept is basically a pita reflection of subway sandwiches
Choose your hearts' desire from the menu and add as many toppings as you please
Very good, filling and cheap
We totally jammed out to old school R&B playing through the night (BONUS POINTS for good choice in music)
The Odeon at Tollcross is one of the smaller cinemas in town, but without the charm of the smaller independent cinemas such as the Cameo
The good news is that like the bigger cinemas they also do Orange Wednesday here, so on a Wednesday you can halve the cost of a ticket just so long as you bring a friend along with you and take advantage of the Orange 2 for 1 deal
The main benefit of this cinema is its convenience to those in the area
The Omnicentre offers a far larger range of films and Cineworld is far cheaper so if you are able to get to the others as easily then they might be the preference
That said, I personally go most regularly to this cinema - I don't want to walk all the way to Cineworld and the Omnicentre is too far away
This is the benefit of this cinema and that is the fact that it becomes cheaper than elsewhere once you factor in getting the bus elsewhere; unfortunately this benefit only hold for locals, but being near the centre you might pass this cinema more often than you might think
Last film is usually at 9pm and first can vary sometime being as late as midday so look it up in advance for times
I've been on a gluttonous tour of Charlotte's unhealthiest restaurants lately
My latest endeavor was the oddly named wing joint d
I've had my fair share of wings from many a local and chain restaurants, and honestly to me they all seem very similar
Like most wing places, they have a bar, a multitude of TVs, and ample wing flavors
Something unique they offer is their fried broccoli cheese balls, which may induce a heart attack, but at least they taste delicious
Not to mention the fact that they charge for ranch dressing ($
Last time a mistake was made in our order it almost turned into an argument with the waitress who eventually pulled the manager over
We asked for boneless and got bone in- it should of been a simple fix not a confrontation
My husband continues to want to go back so I guess I will continue to begrudgingly go back
Really nice and helpful on the phone~ I live in Chicago and wanted to order a pre/post-natal massage set for my bff who lives in Gilbert, and they were very helpful
Will update after feedback
We have visited multiple times
Love the Mac N cheese, frozen hot chocolate, huevos rancheros, sweet potato fries, hamburger, sundaes etc
We try to visit every time we are in Vegas
We walked in at 650pm on a weekday night and discovered that they close at 7pm
Went immediately over to LUX
It looked nice but without evening hours, this place is giving away business
Until they change their hours they will rarely get our business
A fun little place with wonderful guacamole and roasted chili salsa
Had a really great lunch here
The place was really busy, but service was still pretty fast
The food portions are GIGANTIC and you can't leave this place hungry
Prices are in line with the quality and huge portions
The fried chicken is excellent, as was the cheese and grits
I was prepared to love Hula's upon my first visit on a Wednesday evening
I see so many positive reviews that I'll give it another try
But its tooooooooooooooo friggen hot
The thing that destroyed it for us was their stupid glass water bottles which we were afraid to drop, which i did drop and break
Maybe they'll learn a lesson
you smokers and your unbelievably offensive smoke
We live in California where I havent seen or heard of a person smoking in nearly 7 years
Here, we couldnt get away from smoke being blown right in our face from numerous directions
And a bunch of 21 year olds shoving into eachother on the dance floor
Girls who think a packed dance floor is the place for them to take up 6 square feet to do their "moves" end up slamming into those on the edges, who then get pissed, and various fights almost start
Hot young chicks dancing on the pedestal, and brilliant vibrant lighting, but its just too small, and too
Smelled like body juice hot
Its a cool small place I guess
But you will have a better time at XS
I got the large and man was there plenty of meat and rice
I did need a sweet donut after eating the hotness of the rice bowl
I really liked this particular location of Walnut Grill
I visited for the first time a few weeks ago and really enjoyed myself
I wasn't expecting much, but was pleasantly surprised
My boyfriend and I dropped by prior to a networking charity event that we were attending
Neither one of us was particularly hungry so we just ordered apps
I ordered the Sweet Chili Chicken Lettuce Wraps, which was a rather large dish for an app
It could easily be split between two people
It was so super deliciously yummy
Or yummily delicious, whichever you prefer
:D There was an ample amount of chicken lightly covered in a really great sweet chili sauce along with walnuts, onions, and other things that I forget
You had to put the wrap together yourself, which sort of annoyed me, but they were so good
Another plus: they randomly had Pumpking
Thank God we got it there that visit because by that weekend it was all gone
I would chose this location over the others that I have visited because the food was really steps above
Service at all locations has been tremendously pleasant, very good
As much as I hate to write this I just have to
I always loved coming here because of the vast inventory
I weathered the evil employees and management because there were just too many goodies
OK so Millie is dead but Millie jr and so on are meanies
What is up with people who buy Hallmark stores
After spending thousands of dollars on Swarovski in the past 2 years, not to mention hundreds in dept
So, never mind that I waited at the Swarovski counter as everyone ignored me, I just figured it was the sweatshirt
I mean, I really didn't look the part of the buyer
I looked more the part of the shoplifter, but, oh well
Never judge a book by its cover
After asking for help I waited
Ok, so you can't find one of the pieces I'm looking for
Not to mention after spending that kind of money I get the big $2 and $3 coupon from the big spenders Hallmark, I have to get attitude from the road torn and worn redhead at the counter
I explained how Swarovski is giving %15 off over $150
If you can't match it I will just order from them
response "OK" uhhhh  Can you match it "NO"
Not sorry, not oooh wish I could, no tsk, the big FU NO
I was fortunate enough to stay with friends here Super Bowl weekend when one of them had a comp'd room
Been to the Cosmopolitan for a night at Marquee a couple of times but this was my first time staying in the hotel
I really like the look & decor of the Cosmo
I don't know how to describe it except that it can fit right in South Beach with its styling and feel
From the artwork scattered around the hotel, the shops, the casino itself, the random sitting areas, the pool table anyone can use upstairs, the pools, the vending machines that dispense little 'tile or block' works of art
down to the people that choose to gamble and party here
It's definitely a good look
Marquee is the spot to party at in Vegas these days
I have no complaints at all
But i can't go into too much detail either
We had a clear view of the Bellagio water fountain from our windows
The beds were comf, the pillows were plump, the amenities very well thought out and some just seemed random
I did like the many electrical outlets on the desk itself
Vegas hotels seem to hide electrical outlets or seem to furnish their rooms with the bare minimum
Dark woods, black marble & chrome
Two sinks, nice robes & towels provided, separate toilet area for privacy to handle bidness, awesome water pressure from the overhead rain shower
See through stand-up shower must be made for some Vegas deviousness
Lobby area near check-in was very dramatic with the ever changing display panels that line the columns
A modern but artistic touch
Cant forget to to talk about the valet
Despite being a busy hotel, the amount of time waiting for our car to be retrieved was not bad at all
Cushy seating while you wait
Take the escalator down at the back entrance so it's away from the chaos that is the taxi drop off & pick up area
I'd stay there again for sure
Hopefully we'll get a terrace suite next time
Only hotel rooms in Vegas with them
Tonight I needed a burrito fix after an extremely long night at work
Roberto's answered my need with a carne asada burrito with just beans, cheese and rice
It was super quick and super tasty
Thanks for helping me in my moment of need :)
So, we had just gotten into Vegas not an hour before, and hungry after our five hour drive we decided to hit up Du Pars - I had had their chili before and loved it, so why not again
I'll tell you why not - roaches
While we were eating our soups and salads, I looked up to see a large roach cruising along the walls right next to our booth
While I was able to maintain "big girl" status and didn't scream, I did point it out to my mom and boyfriend
We then told our waiter that we had a little "friend"  and that we weren't so pleased about it
Rather than being sympathetic, he offered to move us to a table over and told us it was no big deal, roaches are everywhere after all
Somehow we were all able to continue picking at our food til it we were finally brought our check, and when we went up to pay my mom, who was thoroughly grossed out, mentioned quietly and politely to the cashier that they may have a roach problem
No, the cashier insisted, they DO NOT have a roach problem
According to her, every restaurant has a few roaches crawling at the walls
That may be true, I don't know, but if it is how come this was my first experience with roaches in a restaurant, and my first experience seeing a roach in the open, not even trying to hide itself
In the end, the servers were just defensive, didn't offer a discount, wouldn't have accepted it if we wanted to walk out of there without the rest of our meal, and were generally rude about all of this
Having flown into Edinburgh twice now, I thought it was time to leave a review
Edinburgh airport is a smaller airport by some comparisons but it appears to be well maintained, clean and organized
Travel through security , check-in and customs are quite efficient compared to other airports
The airlink service linking the airport to the city center for \u00a33
A disgrace to small business owners
I am aware of how hard it is to compete with big box stores as a small business owner
So, I make every effort to "shop local"
I want to support my neighbors that are fighting the good fight against the man, or Sam (WalMart)
HOWEVER, when you are treated badly, over charged and/or ignored in a locally owned business, it makes it very difficult to accept the few extra dollars you will be spending for your goods or services
This store is one of the biggest disappointments of the West side
Bead Haven in on Lake Mead just West of Buffalo on the North side of the street, which is roughly 3 miles from my house
I have shopped there between 6-8 times in last couple of years
I usually head there if I have a special project I want an eye catching piece for and thusly can justify the extra cost, or when I get my oil changed just down the street
I wish I were exaggerating when I say that EVERY time I have been in there, I have been treated poorly
Each time I have shopped, the woman that owns the store, with her sister, has rolled her eyes, sighed when spoken to & taken a sour tone with me
The last 2 visits were the worst
In mid to late March I was in and spent my usual $40 or so in beads, and as the woman was bagging my purchase, one of the beads dropped, broke in half & she charged me for it anyway
Last week I found myself in there again, due to my oil change, and was wandering around
Asked a couple of questions about the pricing on some of the chains I was planning to purchase, and got the usual rude responses; when an older lady, she had recognized as a long time customer there requested some beads to string her eyeglasses on
She flatly told the woman she "couldn't pay her enough to string beads for her"
The woman said it had been done for her before & seemed disappointed
Too thick and the sausage isn't seasoned well
For the price, you get fed
No one said you get fed with great food
Been meaning to update my review after I had my service done
It was as great as I expected
The hospitality and service at this place is amazing
I had popped in the day before my appointment because I wanted to make sure I could find the place and not be lost on my wedding day and we wanted to peek at the salon
They were so nice and offered to answer any questions I had
I had sewn in extensions and asked if it would be problem or not but they assured me it would be fine
They are so accommodating
I can't say enough good things about this place, they helped make my wedding day wonderful
I'm posting photos of my hair and also a shot of my wedding party because they did hair for all of them as well
Even in 98 plus degree weather, our hair looked awesome
I love me a good Chicago Dog and this place is pretty solid
Vienna Beef everything, dogs, neon green relish, steamed poppy seed buns
They have all the right ingredients that's for sure
I prefer the jumbo vienna beef hot dogs
They are skinless and a little fatter
I've always thought the regular Vienna Beef dog, gets a little lost in all the toppings, and that was the case here
However I swear as I was walking out, I heard them telling a customer about the Jumbo dog
But I never saw it on the menu - darn it
The skin on the regular dog gives it a little snap when you eat it, which doesn't really do much for me either way, but most Chicago Dog aficionados swear by the snap
While this was a good Chicago dog, it could have used a little more celery salt and the tomatoes could have been a little better
I did like how their pickle spear was sliced thin enough to actually be eaten along with the dog
Most places you have to take the pickle off and eat it separately
5 stars for the Chicago dog
The star of the show was the Chicago Italian Beef Sandwich
They serve it dry, wet, or dipped
We decided to go wet and it had just the right amount of sogginess to it
I had them add mozzarella cheese and got the giardinera pepper mix on the side
They have two levels of spice on the giardinera mix - medium and hot
We went medium and it had just the right amount of vinegary spice to it
The Beef itself had a nice peppery flavor to it, and it just melted in your mouth as it's been simmering in it's own au jus
I don't really get the pizza puff
After reading the yelp reviews, I thought some yelpers were on to something here, so I had to give it a try
I found it very uninspired
It had small pieces of ground sausage, tomato sauce, and mozzarella cheese, in a pastry
Nothing that you can't get a frozen version of at a grocery store
Well, lunch just arrived so I better get to eating
Very relaxing and inviting
Went for lunch during the work day (1-2p)
We were seated right away but then no sign of the waiter
finally someone shows up and says that he isn't our waiter, but he can get our drink orders if we want
Our water glasses got low and were occasionally refilled
We received our food, from who I think is supposed to be our waitress (not sure since we never see her again)
The bill was delivered by what my fellow diner thought was supposed to be our waiter
We waited some more to have our check taken
I was late to my 2pm meeting
Not sure why the slow service
The were not terribly busy
We were one of 5 tables filled
I had the burger and my fellow diner had the Bahn Mi
We thoroughly enjoyed both
Not sure I would ever go there again
I may try the Bahn Mi to go
I don't like the physical layout of this club, it's too claustrophobic
It's definitely worth checking out though, and I did like the outdoor portions of the venue
The dance floor was way too small at the show I went too
They should change their name, this is not a real Korean BBQ place
I was wondering why nobody else was in the restaurant
I believe this place is run by a bunch of kids, their parents would be so disappointed or at the very least Koreans, so embarrassing
I will not be returning to this place
The only thing I did like about the place other than the meat quality was the doenjang/bean paste
All of the Yelp reviewers are right
Excellent audience participation act
Roller skaters are astonishing
Excellent blend of acrobatics, comedy, and music
For all shows, for memories and marketing, performers may want to consider being available for pictures afterward like Penn and Teller
Charge at a reasonable price point
It will be a win-win for everyone
Like all shows, check Yelp and Google for a discount
If you're easily offended, don't go to this show
Omg I just tried this place for the first time today and it was amazing
I only had a few small bites before coming to the conclusion that this is some great BBQ
I am so glad I found this little treasure
I will most definitely be back again, again and again
After checking out the scene at Degree 270, my friend and I decided to end the evening w/ something sweet at Black Fig Bistro
We both like chocolate and peanuts, and I'd had the opportunity to try the peanut butter and chocolate tart here a few times before, so I suggested we order this
My friend LOVED this dessert
:)  I was already satisfied w/ my half of the pastry
:P  In any case, we decided we'd try another-- a yellow cake w/ chocolate ganache and finished w/ chocolate and white chocolate curls
Well, it looked better than it tasted
The cute curlicues of chocolate weren't enough to save this pastry--  they tasted old, as if they've been in the fridge for too long
I'd check out the other desserts, but not very late in the day
Always love coming here for lunch
The wind is excellent in any of the curries but especially the spiked Thai tee
Contrary to the banner on the top of this page, this business has not moved
It still serves the same horrid disgusting pizza and other food made to clean out your digestive tract and send you to the pharmacy
I ordered a large pizza from them
I ate a part of one slice, then a part of a second slice then threw it all in the garbage
What more can I say about them
Save your money and get pizza elsewhere
Move over Sura and all other Korean AYCE BBQ - the new undisputed champ has arrived and that is Woo Nam Jung
The atmosphere, service, and food quality trumps them all
They serve their gal bi filet style where it's cut from the bone
Almost all the other serve the other cut of ribs where with 2-3 small bones in each
The taste and quality of their meats is so much better
I like how they bring the food to you and help you cook- added service bonus
The atmosphere is also much nicer and their ventilation is better so you won't be coming out smelling like BBQ as much
Considering this place has been open a few months and only has 12 reviews, I'm really surprised
This place is severely underrated and is easily my favorite AYCE BBQ
Maybe the remodel has things a bit confused
Hotel room was well decorated but it was not clean
There was a dirty wine glass in my room and another missing
The dirty wine glass had someone's lipstick on it
I also found a toenail in my bed
I called down about the glass and the employee called and said id have two new glasses ASAP
I mentioned the toenail and the rep said "wow, sorry that's so odd" Yeah
I asked for feather pillows and I was told they didn't carry them
Fair enough, although odd for this kind of hotel
My last nights stay they came to replace my pillows with feather
It had jets, which I was looking forward to
What I wasn't expecting was that the jets were dirty as well
I turned them on and this green algae kept shooting out
After a few different tries to flush the stuff out I just gave up
Upon speaking with the hotel staff at check out as well they did not really care
They just said "that's odd" and "I'm so sorry
" I would have liked some compensation off of my hotel stay because it wasn't cheap, instead after writing a letter upon my return I got a response for a free upgrade if I stay there at a future date
Upgrade depending on the time of year etc special rules and restrictions apply
I have a year to use it, we'll see if I cash that in or just move on to a nicer more put together establishment
I've traveled a lot over the years, and I think this was probably the worst hotel stay of my life to date, and that includes the time I got my stuff stolen by employees
If you haven't stopped into this joint yet, you have to give it a shot
It used to be Screwballs, which was a ratty dive, but the new owner has completely renovated the property
It now has a small restaurant seating area, large open bar area with table seating as well and TV's everywhere
The menu is very nice and while I haven't tried a lot of their items, they have a good selection of food, they have awesome burgers
Their Sausage over Penne Pasta was also great
The staff there is also very friendly and they're open 24 hrs
Wish I could leave 0 stars
It took 1 hour and 45 minutes to get served cold horrible food
I actually had to get coffee myself
Had to get a manager to get cream and splenda
Just throw your money in the street before you waste it here
I can't remember having worse service
Tried a variety of tapas, all were amazing
Service was a bit slow at times, especially since they weren't particularly busy
The sugar cane pork and the sizzling shrimp were my favorites
The dessert wontons were also pretty good, and the small portion was perfect to wrap up the meal
Also tried a martini, which was very strong and tasty
Atmosphere was spot on for the art district
Called on a Sunday inquire in diagnostics was told free tow and diagnostic was $85
Understood and advised us they wouldn't want ti charge us fir nothing as money toward repairs is most important
Called Monday no update, they called Tuesday to say oh well there needs to be labor diagnostic now so will be an additional $350 and we need to sign
Came down distraught asking for explanation , Mark raised his voice at me started talking down to me as if I'm stupid , we said never mind may just junk car
Mark then made us wait being condescending giving us an invoice for $195
Best of luck to a beginner's stab at a restaurant
I doubt they will be around long:
Main entrance is not used, everyone who came in after us could not find the door
I actually had to point the direction for at least six customers who stood at the locked doors
"Market Price" board at entry is small, dark, and unreadable
Spartan surrounding devoid of any decor
Music; radio station blaring loudly and preventing normal conversation
Service staff, though eager, are ill prepared and trained
Calamari appetizer, typical batter fried rings served with as much lemon wedges as product
Shrimp Po-Boy, shrimp was adequate but no better than frozen batter fried from the grocery
Parmesan garlic fries, add $1 for standard out of the bag potatoes coated liberally in garlic with a touch of Parmesan cheese
Whole Tilapia battered and fried (overly fried) served with large serving of plain white rice and a small cup of Coleslaw, $15
Nothing is offered or provided
Sweetener, salt, pepper, soy sauce, ketchup, eating utensils (plastic), etc
Maybe it was a bad night but the prices remain out of line for the quality and dining experience
Since then I've been excited when they opened a location closer to me, the Orangewood location
When I tried that location it was like I was eating the same quality as the original
Now when this location opened, just a little closer to me, I was excited, thinking I'd get fat from visiting too much
That worry was soon solved as I took my first bite into their burros
First off, the chile is really thick, although this wouldn't be too bad a thing it's too obvious
It's clearly thickened with flour, because my mouth still feels gritty from eating it
There was so much flour that it was half the flavor of the burro
Second, if that wasn't enough flour for you
The burro is wrapped in a very thick tortilla, unlike their other locations which have a great balance of chile (and thickness), as well as the thickness of their tortillas
I had high hopes for you guys but you let me down
To those who read this, don't be discouraged about Rito's
Their original and Orangewood locations still deliver the goods
I love, love, love this place
My nails always look fabulous when I leave there, and I'm picky about my nails
This is the only place I will go
I've eaten here several times
Each time leaves me wanting something else
The service is always slow
The staff is inattentive and our waitress was too busy on her phone to actually pay attention to us
They weren't even busy - I think there were 2 other people there the whole time
If it was busy, I could understand slow service - but it wasn't
It was clearly a lack of caring and respect for the customers
This is probably the 4th time that it has happened, so I felt it was time to write a review
Everything we've eaten here has been very good - albeit over-priced
My complaint is not with the food, but rather with the prices and the service
They seem to be continually jacking up the prices on their menu - each time I am expecting to pay one price and ask about it, and they are usually like, "oh, we redid the menu" and then they give some lame excuse as to why the prices have gone up
They used to have a $10 lunch special that was good and worth dealing with the poor service - but they have since removed the special
The excuse they gave me when I asked about it was: that they needed their menu to be the same for lunch and dinner and the lunch special added to the daily prep
It was a pizza and salad for $10
Then, she informed me that I could order the same thing, the salad and pizza separately (for an extra $6 vs the special)
So, no, not really any extra prep
I own several restaurants, so I knew it was a poorly invented excuse to blame it on the prep
It's like just be honest, and say that the special was temporary and they are not offering it anymore - no need to make stuff up
Also, this restaurant is weird about accepting their coupons
The owners also own the Blu Burger next door (which is weird, because service in there is usually much better than I've ever had at Teatro - but Blu IS still pricey)
Like I said, the food is good - but unfortunately, their poor service and expensive prices overrides the good food
The burgers were very good and fairly priced though with no sides
If this were a normal restaurant that would bring me back
The beer selection was adequate
Although at least one other review complained about only having Arizona beers I thought that was a strength
The problem is that this isn't a normal restaurant
There are elaborate procedures to line you up, educate you on how to order, identify a table, then order at a cash register, then get your own condiments and soft drinks or water then carry your drinks, etc to the table
Tipping is expected though no service was provided except taking an order and identifying a table
From there it is full service
The only service I can think of other than food and alcoholic beverages already ordered at the cashier would have been a second drink but we had our food shortly after beverages so didn't need another or dessert which wasn't needed
The waitress seemed nice and did check back
Something else which bothered me is that silverware is not provided except a steak knife and there are no napkins, just paper towels
So great burgers, good beers, complicated self serve systems and no table setting
This doesn't meet my desires
I am not sure how mobility challenged customers could do it
The British Cornish Pasty is the Spanish empanada, the Jamaican patty, the Indian samosa
It is essentially meat and veg wrapped in pastry then baked
Done right it can be delicious
Although being from the north-west of England the pasties I ate weren't Cornish, they were a variation of the Irish pasty
Same concept, but lighter pastry, flakey, almost puff pastry
I always thought the crust of a true Cornish pasty was too tough, almost cardboard-esque, (some say they were made this way to prevent damage if they were dropped down a mine)
But this is not the case for the pasties from Cornish Pasty Co
At Cornish Pasty Co they are light and tasty and the fillings were great
From the traditional Oggie to lamb or chicken or pork or cheese steak
There's even a tongue-in-cheek pasty which pays homage to Pulp Fiction
If you're a vegetarian, there aren't just a couple of choices, there is a whole page for you
The beer list was extensive and varied, the patio wrapped around the whole building and the service was quick, attentive and engaging
My carne asada torta was terrible
The meat marinade made it seem store bought and it was so tough I could barely eat it
Was hoping for an authentic west side Mexican spot
you better fix it guys, cause that meal sucked
I ordered the shrimp Burrito, What I received was some of the worst tasting shrimp in my life
It tasted as though it was microwaved it was so rubbery and tough
Service is still good and efficient but the Shrimp really was horrible
The server Alex was awesome
The reason for the bad review is because of the food
I would never eat here again
I would train the kitchen staff how to cook better
I had to send the fish back because it smelled and tasted expired
It had a bad smell and when I tried it i had to spit it into a napkin because I could not swallow it
I asked for a chicken sandwich instead which was dry and tasteless
I will never come back here due to the food
I am in love with the Reformed Studios
What I like most about Reformed Central are the combo classes
I took the Reform & Ride class yesterday and it was a great workout - it's the best combo of Pilates and cardio
